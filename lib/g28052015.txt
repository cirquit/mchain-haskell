Hello /g/After hearing about cryptolocker i'm kinda scared. I have about 8tb of storage where 5tb is in use. These are movies, series, pictures, documents, games. Anything from the past 12 years really.I am scared as shit I will ever lose my shit, so i'm kinda looking for backup possibilities.I do not want to upload it or put it in a cloud for a couple of reasons. Reason #1 is it will probably take weeks for me to upload with my internet speed and 2nd is security. We all remember the Fappening, and I just dont want it.So this probably leaves me with one option and that is backing it up myself on a device. Now i've been looking for external hdd's but they are still pretty pricey. 8tb external hdd's cost about 300 bucks or even 500 bucks. I do not have that atm, but I want to backup my shit so bad that i'm willing to eat a little less the coming month so I can afford one.But that made me think, isn't there a way I can compress it? Would I be able to compress 6tb on a 4tb hdd? I can afford a 4tb hdd, but it would probably not be enough to backup everything simply by copying it.Which leads to my final point, where and how to store it.I figure it needs to be very very very shock-resistant and also temperature-resistant and maybe even fire-proof.How do you guys do your backups?Thanks for thinking with me
Simply burrying it is a bit far-fetched, so maybe I should look into a fire-proof safe?And then use a whole lot of plastic-air-bubble-paper and maybe tinfoil to make it heat-proof, or would that work negatively as in it could get even hotter than the outside?
install gentoo
Refreshing.
Cryptolocker is crackable. Look it up, RogueAmp also has stuff on it.
Yeah I read about it but of course a PC could ever crash or my current hdd's could crash. I'm still interested in the backupping and cryptolocker is just one reason to look into it.I know a couple of ways how I could fuck up and lose everything but more importantly are the reasons I cant think of, so I still want it.
>I am scared as shit I will ever lose my shit, so i'm kinda looking for backup possibilities.Pay a professional archive service to do it.  Maybe somebody local who can come to your house, or who ends you the hardware, then you send it back to them.>But that made me think, isn't there a way I can compress it?There are hundreds of ways to reduce the file sizes, from simply zip files, to PNG compression tools, to re-encoding videos.>Which leads to my final point, where and how to store it.In an off-site location.
BackupNot CheapPick One.
Why would I pay someone to drag and drop my files? Any 12 year old can do it.Yes I know there is compression but im wondering how much I can compress it. Is it possible to m ake 6tb into 4tb? Off-site location is probably best but since I do not know anyone it would probably be expensive, and also kinda annoying since I would have to go there every month to update the backup.Isn't a fire-proof safe an idea? I figure I can put more in it than just an external hdd.Also how to store it? By just laying it in there or should I use air bubble wrap with tin foil or something and secure it to the safe itself on the inside?Not not cheap, just cheapest
Think about how long it takes to encrypt 8 tb of data
Compression ratio depends on the files you're compressingFor off-site you could use a safety deposit box
>install gentoo (or ubuntu), don't allow a windows install access to these files>set up a RAID configuration>if necessary, back it up to some "cloud" service
Here is a funfact when purchasing external drives99% of the time their just regular hard drivesso buy the cheapest usb3.0 external (with power holy shit, never use those usb powered ones) and rip the bitch apart and stick whatever drive you want insideused to do this with laptop externals>40gb $20 (sale)>100gb $100>bought the 40gb and dropped an old caviar black 300gb into it>worked like new
Or you can just buy the enclosure...
Thats the point of this thread retard
>How do you guys do your backups?Tapes, best gb/dollar ratio ever.
>But that made me think, isn't there a way I can compress it? Would I be able to compress 6tb on a 4tb hdd? I can afford a 4tb hdd, but it would probably not be enough to backup everything simply by copying it.If most of your data is something that's already compressed like video, audio and images that's not going to recompress very well at all. Unless you go for lossy compression with lower quality.
>i've been looking for external hdd's but they are still pretty pricey>i'm willing to eat a little less the coming month so I can afford one.Well you're going to eat less for two months as you really should have two backups. What if the backup drive fails?Videos and pictures do not really compress at all.
One backup is on my current pc/external hdd setup and the other backup is not connected to the computerbut yeah with this logic you would never stop buying backup drives
look into pied piper's middle out compression scheme.I hear hooli will be releasing their own version soon as well.
>Why would I pay someone to drag and drop my files? Any 12 year old can do it.For the hardware, for the verification, for the provision of safety.  For the professional advice that a competent person can give.  Though be warned, the world is full of morons.Still, like I said, they can send you the hardware, you do it, you send it back to them to keep.>Yes I know there is compression but im wondering how much I can compress it. Is it possible to make 6tb into 4tb?I cannot provide a definitive answer without seeing the files and their current state.  Is it impossible?   No.  Is it possible you can't?  Yes.>Off-site location is probably best but since I do not know anyone it would probably be expensive, and also kinda annoying since I would have to go there every month to update the backup.Not necessarily, incremental backups would use less data, and maybe you don't need it monthly, but can manage quarterly or annually.>Isn't a fire-proof safe an idea? I figure I can put more in it than just an external hdd.It's an idea.  That  may do almost nothing for you.http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2011/01/choosing-and-using-a-home-safe/index.htmGet the right safe or it's a waste.>Also how to store it? By just laying it in there or should I use air bubble wrap with tin foil or something and secure it to the safe itself on the inside?Those could actually be worse.  The bubble wrap would melt onto your HDD.  So might the foil.  Think about it.
at the time i did thatthe enclosure was actually more than the small externalbut i guess that just depends on the day
then the enclosure could melt too
5tb of drives will cost you $250, $130 if you're in the US.Buy them. Back up.
i dont live in the US5tb? never heard of thatisnt it always 2, 4, 8 etc?
Digital hoarding is the most autistic thing.
Dumb trollI guess you still keep picture albums
Also there is no such thing unless you keep doubles, which still isnt completely irrational if you have the money for it as it's digital and wont take up any physical spacewhy would I delete every picture, movie, song after I viewed it or listened to it?
>i dont live in the USI'm so sorry my poor yuropooriean friend :(
How would you back them up automatically in a safe way?If the backup drives are connected to your main PC, then  every NAS +  local drive you have can still be infected by it.
We had 'home copy tax' once but luckely they stopped it.But we don't get shot in school and at the cinema luckelyI guess every country has pro's and cons
Did you even read the thread, its NOT gonna be connected to the pc, hence why I looked for fire-safe and safety deposti boxes etcits only gonna be connected once a month or so when I update itbut yeah if i would have a sleeper virus i could still be fucked i guess
>muh videos>muh meme folders.>muh gamesworrying about losing them is pretty pitiful. Important data does not = large amountsergo it's not much different from those autists who can't throw their old junk out.
So you assume I have 5tb of meme images?Why dont you fuck off? Most shit are movies and family pictures and music. I dont wanna download 5tb of shit again if I lose it, not to mention that some shit CANNOT ever be replaced or found again. but im happy you have no problem with that and have nothing that has any value to you
>listen to song>oh that was nice>delete song
Yep, that too, but I don't know what you were planning to buy, just that you talked about bubble wrap.
the bubble rap is for transportation or for any possible shocks while moving it or bumps etc
>Did you even read the threadI'm not talking about your case specifically.>its only gonna be connected once a monthThat's very ineffective. Losing a month's worth of data is still very catastrophic. If I lost that much time on my main project I would probably stop doing it
It's $50/Tb, so a 3TB at $150 and a 2TB at $100, there, $250.Once 8TB's where on sale in the US for $130.
losing a month worth of downloads is not as catastrophic since its all personal files I dont mind re-downloading the music from the past month, I do mind losing my history and family picturesonce a month is fine unless you have a companylosing one month is nothing compared to losing your entire life
If you have auto-backup on then when your shit gets crypto'd you're gonna loose it all anyway.You plug it in once a month. You back it up. You unplug the drives.
>Once 8TB's where on sale in the US for $130.damn, im jellyi cant imagine 8tb for $130 being decent quality though
I am too, I'm stuck in ausfagistan, it's worse then Europe down here.
No, the mention was in the storage state in the safe.  In terms of shipping, then use bubble wrap, because those hazards are worse.You don't need to worry about those kinds of vibrations in your house, even with an earthquake though, unless you live on a boat or something, in which case, a person can look into fire-resistant materials that would serve.
>it's not much different from those autists who can't throw their old junk out.Collectors are not hoarders.
yeah im a dutchfag and here they put high taxes on storage to make up for people downloadingso unfair
Buy a tape drive. Tape costs about $25 for a 1.5TB tape; you'd only need 4. Personally, I'd buy 8 tapes and make a double backup, and bury 4 of them in plastic containers (sealed and double boxed) at least four feet deep.
hoarders is a stupid word anyway, this only applies for people who refuse to throw out old pizza boxes and milk cartons and shit, not people who keep media
do you have any idea how expensive tape drives are? also it looks very inconvenient, i think external hdd's are bestAffordable 1tb usb-sticks when?
>relying on downloads for a music collection HohohoWhy don't you backup your family pictures and stop downloading movies then. After all, you could always buy movies on a disk; at least you'll have something tangible that you can hoard lol
Why dont you just fuck off and stop deciding what I can and can't have as this is none of your fucking business.>I dont like keeping my files so you can't either!You fucking sperglord
>$16/TB tapes>$1500 driveYeah, its not cheaper for the average user.
but the tape drives cost a thousand bucks or somethingfor a thousand bucks i probably have enough storage for my entire life, so money/storage-wise and for the sake of ease I think external hdd's are the better choice
Just see if you can rent one for a day.
You can get tape drive 2nd hand fairly cheap.
Btw, how about a fucking internal hdd?Wouldn't it be better to just put a 4tb INTERNAL hdd in my pc every month to back up it on that?Yeah its a little more efford than an external one, but maybe way cheaper and smaller and durable maybe?
Digital hoarders can exist though.Collector = -Has a goal or reason for collecting content.-Wants to keep their collection organized & clean-Shares it with others/has plans on sharing it-Does not collect things deemed unnecessary(actual thought is put into it)-Basically a librarian Hoarder =-Has no goals or reasons for collecting-Doesn't care about keeping it organized-Does not care for sharing it-Collects anything and everything with little to no thought behind it
>have to rent the drive every time you want to make a new backup or restore from it
Crashplan serviceCheap for unlimited backup space.Just encrypt before uploading.
>renting a tape drive every monthnah man this shit is way too much of a pain in the ass for my purposes, sorryYou are so fucking full of shit, what are you even trying to do
>-Collects anything and everything with little to no thought behind itSounds like my internet habit from 1997 to 2015...

Second hand tape drives are dirt cheap. Starting from $30.
>Assuming anyone does exactly this>Assuming nobody has a reason to keep the files he downloadsSeriously take your autismpills
But how do you burn stuff on it?
>trusting second-hand hardware to backup your important data
What is the reason you buy a nice car? What is the reason for that particular table you have bought? What is the deal with that painting on your wall? Do you even need it? So many unneeded shit. Anon what are you doing with your life. You have a serious problem. Why the hell would you keep more than 3 t-shirts anon? Nobody possibly could have any reason for that. You have problems. You need to consult a professional.
>Assuming nobody has a reason to keep the files he downloadsGoogle mental conditions and how they play into hoarding. Being ignorant is not an argument.What are you even trying to argue? Your analogies don't make sense and you aren't being specific in what you're trying to prove.
Where the fuck have I or anyone said that they download and keep everything they come by?There is literally no reason why digital hoarding would be bad IF someone would even do this, which I highly doubt. Never seen or heard from anyone that downloads everything. Would seem impossible. Maybe Google does.
Verify every backup after recording.On tape cartridges.
I give up. Ok anon, I, and anyone else that keeps their files is indeed a digital hoarder.You are right, I was wrong. Please leave now.
>Where the fuck have I or anyone said that they download and keep everything they come byGod damn nigger learn how to read a fucking sentence.If you do not download everything they come by, then you're not a hoarder. Get it? Understand that logic? Holy shit you're an idiot.>Never seen or heard from anyone that downloads everythingYes.Yes people like that exist.Those people are hoarders.Just because you think they do not exist does not magically mean they are not real.
If you need to ask that question, don't get a tape backup solution.
Just run Linux. Problem solved.
WHO THE FUCK HAS BEEN HOARDING THEN AND WHY DO YOU ASSUME ANYONE EVEN HOARDS?It is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE to download the entire fucking internet, there isnt enough room.Nobody could EVER be a digital hoarder except google datacenter
>collecting 1 and 0's ahahahahaWorrying about digital data that has no consequence other than taking up space and you worrying about backups
Poorfag method:- Get two external HDDs.- Back up only legit content that you care about, you can always re-pirate your music and decade old chinese cartoons if you have to.- Use whole disk encryption of your choice.- Keep one off-site somewhere trusted and reasonably close that you can swap them semi-frequently. Your office, your parents' house etc.Paranoid (expensive) live method:- build small offsite server with only VPN/ssh tunnel access- no VPS you fool- rsync
>It is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE to download the entire fucking internetMy god.You really are stupid and don't understand anything that's being said.You're comprehension is beyond my help.
>It is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE to download the entire fucking internet,I've done it. Twice.I gonna do it again, too. Or die trying.
I worry because if my pc gets fucked I would lose all my family pictures, all my music, shit that probably wont ever be found again.There is no fucking way that this fits the definition of digital hoarding.Question: Did anyone save this thread? And all threads you have seen today? If so: You are a digital hoarder.Nobody ever did this so just fuck off already you dumb cunt
>you can always re-pirate your music and decade old chinese cartoons if you have to.No you fucking can't. Some shit can't be found again.Sure you could probably find music again from famous artists, but alot of shit is personal and cant be found on the internet.Figuring out what can't and can't be found again within 5TB of data is a chore that would take MONTHSBut I guess anyone who makes backups is a digital hoarder.
>: Did anyone save this thread?saved
You dirty digital hoarderConsult help

260x>980 in dx12
>4k>dx12Nice gimmicks, fag. Enjoy you're no drivers.
nvidia only build their cards for the current shitworks games they pay for, they want you to upgrade when the next batch of cards come outits why 780ti is now worse than a 290 when before it used to be faster, same thing will happen with maxwel
>no driversare we still doing this
Amd has been better at higher resolutions for some time now
 AMD Propaganda. Cherry picking benchmarks to the extreme. I'm rooting for team red as I own many of their products but you can't feel good posting this stuff.
Using a meme to try and do damage control... I find it funny how more people complain about Intel and nvidia drivers and performance than people with amd hardware... Keep trying m8
the 260x is a fifth of the price of a 980 anon
I go by personal experience and 3rd party reviewers varying from my favorite youtube ones to several smaller and bigger websites to make hardware decisions. Showing stuff the company making it with either some graph funkyness like 1 inch showing 0-1 then 1-1.6 is like 50 inches is doing lazy trolling and taking it seriously is doing yourself a disservice.
How is it a meme if it's true?
All /g/ cherrypicks man... Amd users post a cherry pick and everyone loses there mind...
Because way more people habe Intel+nvidia? Only poor people buy amd .. Poor people font have self esteem and dont dare to complain ... Logic fucker
Is this because of compute performance? Because Nvidia cards are absolute trash when it comes to that
Not true... That's why its a meme and it doesn't have to be true to a meme it can go either way... Do you even know what a meme is jesus
290x beats the new 970...8350 gets the same performance as a 4770k Not paying for a logo that you can't see and getting better performance makes you a poor fag... Ya alrighf
oh............ really.....................?
Please tell me this is bait I hope no one actually thinks like that
Regardless of OPs pic, its still true.
That's like the nvidia memes... You're not posting about them are you? No so shhNot in almost any case but this... Still a good card but come on...
8350 does not compare to a 4770k you can't be serious. The IPC on a 8350 is garbage.
It's not just a meme it's a reputation. People like me buy based off paper and benchmarks like my last AMD product a 7970. Then real world shows different areas that arnt exactly covered because of time like how long it takes to have a driver out if you do 2+ amd gpus is outrageous for most games working right compared to competition. It's actually to the point where Ill recommend AMD single gpus, never recommend dual amd gpus. I can advise there is complicated but can still recommend and enjoy owning multi gpus with Nvidia brands. There's issues with drivers with any combo of brands and software but theres just MORE with amd because of their resources/management.
its because dx12 =  mantle
I hope you're kidding...
>polygons/sec @ >30 fps
You can't just blame drivers... Even games don't support things like sli properly... Just saying
In a properly threaded environment an 8350 is marginal to a 3770k at like a 3rd of the price...For rendering 3d and video encoding they both do just dandy. If you need 8 threads (heavily multitasking) youd know it.For launching notepad.exe, yeah the i7 will do that faster. Is that worth 200 more dollars? I cant decide that for ya.
You can't bait the baiter my friend
I'm just going to link quotes from a whole site that reviews and tests more hardware then both of us even touch about that 970 bit.http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107-5.html"Introduced at a price point under $350, the GeForce GTX 970 is a disruptive force in the graphics card market. It enabled Radeon R9 290X-class frame rates for less money, forcing AMD to drop the prices on its single-GPU flagship. There's been some kickback from the community as Nvidia originally released some incorrect specifications regarding the card's memory bandwidth, ROPs and L2 cache, but this doesn't change the fact that, more often than not, the GeForce GTX 970 will beat the Radeon R9 290X at similar graphics settings."Saying the r9 290x isnt an amazing value is flat out full retard, but thinking the 970 sucks or something is complete denial of a world we live in. AMD cpus have been a joke past phenom ii. Did you get trolled by am3+ coming out with mobos 6 months before the bulldozer or something and tell yourself it's okay?
It's shit
lol if you need something for heavy workloads you buy a xeon not a shitty am3 processor
Did you even read what I typed? I said there are issues but there is MORE to the point where I cant recommend it with multi gpu and the AMD brand next to the NVidia brand. I had a gtx 295 for a few months from laying around this year earlier and all but DayZ worked fine in SLI. That's pretty good almost legacy 6 year old GPU sli support in many 1-2 year old games I play, as well as a ton of older games.
2500k master race. Four year old processor still crushing it.i7 920 runner up for old grandpa CPU still doing well in games.
72 frames per second is shit?..Meanwhile at camp intel, people actually recommend an i3 over anything FX as if its some sort of poison. Good god you make me sick
The 290x does beat the 970>listening to a review instead of benchmarks when searching for performancewathttp://imgur.com/GfYiDUK,rztkPEz,RSfpceH,upEfkfp,ErBRSDo,cXlvNXT,4SlLvnk,oiS3d3T
it costs less than half as much for like 10% less performance
But it doesSaving 200$ and getting 10 fps less... Not to mention that benchmark is old as shit when it crippled a couple cores on GTA not equal on all cores like it mostly is now... But okay even on that shitty benchmark I'll stick with my build and laugh at you trying to argue wasting 200$The 290x is better... Where have you been?That second part about CPUs lol yea alright what ever you say bud
Really? Because my FX 8320 is serving me just fine anon for 3d renders. If it becomes an issue ill keep that in mind though.
I'm using a sum up of words yes instead of cherry picking like I assume you will looking at benchmarks. The words are a generalization of hundreds of software with the hardware the site reviewed. Your logic saying the words mean nothing when a specific linked bench does mean everything is completely backwards. Enjoy made up land where you think I guess..
lol
Those benchmarks are at stock speed nerd I have my 4690k oc'd to 4.5
 No no no because its not 1000$ its bad according go them
The link that i gave > what tom's hardware saidThis is benchmarks coming from different websites on different games, all showing almost the same resultDon't bury your head like a child saying "lala i don't hear you", you're ridiculous.You don't have anything to counter what i gave; you're wrong.
If you're comparing oc then you're fucked... When the 8350 is oced its going to be better of course... That's like racing two cars that are stock but only one has gas... Fucking retard
> The oc argumentInto the trash.Oc all the chips and the relative difference is still the same retard > less that shitty i3 Cant oc that guy much (fsb) can u?
Someone that isn't shit posting on /g/ is this even possible?
>nVidia buttblasted damage control in progressDaily reminder that he oversees GPU development also.

>He thinks I think what I'm typing he will take as anything but incorrectNo you're playing another game here, but you seem to enjoy it. Must make you feel good to disagree or something. Really gets you what you want on here right?
I want AMD shills to leave before I make a call to the ADL
Thanks I actually tried on it I thought it was pretty funny and sadly trueYou're retarded

So because its not a goy thread spreading bs you want it to stop?
i didnt know linux towald worked at amd
Name calling is another classic card you have I guess. I'm just typing how it is in the real world, and you're typing about your game world on a site called 4chan with anonymous nerds. Enjoy your game.
Just sayin'

So you're just mad because i found something funny? In that case HAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHA BAAAA H AHAHAHAHAHHAGo kill yourself faggit
I want this "AMD is good" meme to go away
No, really. Get the fuck off this board. You're cancer.
But "AMD is bad" is a meme
>DX12 in summer>soon dual GTX780 in my rig>implying I give a fuck about anything elseYep, I have overpayed. Cant make it undone. Wont be salty because cheaper hardware performes better, im gaymen on 1080p anyways.
 Come make me, anon
That's like having 2 gtx 280s soon when the 5870 and 480 is out isnt it? I bought and waited on a 9xx maxwell based off it being the first to support a lot of dx12. You should still get some benefits though till as early as the gtx 480 they said,  or hd 7xxx amd cards on that side.Yeah don't feel bad, at least you get updates to sli profiles. I plan to SLI my 980 in a year or two, I don't plan to get another series of card. I have a gtx 295 that still has plenty of support for SLI in 2015 I used for a few months.
Why do amdrones post benchmarks they don't understand?
Tomshardware, hardware canucks, Linus tech tips, tek syndicate, tech of tomorrow, guru3d, techspot, techpowerup are all good sites and no single cherry picking in a 4chan argument should be taken over any of this combined knowledge we have to choosing parts.The game where you only win if you don't play it nerd. You should see the movie. I think one of Matthew Broderick's first roles.
I'll cum in your fucking booty you faggot now fuck off
Wait so the ADM is using DX12 compared to Nvidia not using DX12?
butt devastated nvidiafag
>tfw 3770K at 4.5GHzAll is well
who /4690k/ here?
>mfw pentium g3258 only gets to 4.3GHz at 1.2Vshould have bought athlon 860k
Now lets see the same graph but with OpenGL 4.5 and on Linux.XD
Sorry mate, 3770k.
Wait, is there actually a chart which says which GPUs are gonna get DX12 support?Cus:>I want that SLI shared Vram >I dont want to use Win10 if my GTX780 doesnt support it.Anyone any info? I've tried google, but it didnt werk.
The 290x was also originally priced at $800 and at one point was over $1,000. It was clearly not meant to compete with the 970/980 (aside from the fact that they came out a year later). AMD however lowered prices on their flagship cards to compete head-on with Nvidia's flagships, even though it was never their intent. As a result, you basically have AMD losing money on every single 290 and 290x sold. The lower prices on these cards is good news for people in the GPU market of course, but it's terrible news for AMD. And despite their best efforts, Nvidia still has a commanding lead in GPU market share.
>$1000was that in USD? also bitcoin drove up AMD card prices to insanity
>also bitcoin drove up AMD card prices to insanityOnly used cards so most people are not affected by this.
It drove up new prices at lots of etailers and the rest were constantly out-of-stock.

@4.6GHz
I fucking told you faggots that AMD would win just because of DX12, that it would outperform nvidia cards.And you laughed at me, everyone of you, telling me that's not how API work.NOW I LAUGH T AT YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUProtip: I never used an AMD card my whole life, I will now.
>179W>60CHa, what an inefficient piece of shit heater. A Titan X can do 101C with that much power draw.Suck it AMDfags
AMD's hardware is so fast, they don't even need drivers kek. The 290X performs just fine in the Witcher 3, AMD don't even have an beta driver out for it yet.
can we please stop with this efficiency argument. Unless you're a nigger living in an african bungalow or your a mining fag then who gives a fuck about heat/power used if the performance is there. Especially given the price.
read what he wrote and you can tell he was pro AMD.
AMDfags did when Fermi was a thing :^)
I'm going to get the 390x if it is worth it, then a couple years later when SLI/XFire programming in DX12 becomes a thing and the card gets slow, I'll get another one for cheap.WIN/WIN.We have a bright future ahead of us, as long as fucking developers won't be lazy by not developing software with Multi-GPU memory stack in mind.
>polygons / sec @ >30fpsLet me guess, 260 runs at 31 fps, 980 runs at 120 fps
The shitposting in this thread is off the scales. I think we've reached /tv/ levels of shitposting. There's no going back now. ;__;
the test runs until the cards slow down to 30 FPS. in fact, 3D mark says on the test to not use it as a benchmark for hardware.
>implying that the gtx 480 was faster than the 5970
I think it has tier 2 support. All nvidia cards back to the 6 or 5 series or something have at least tier 1 support, but if im not mistaken cgn 1.2+ cards are the only ones currently available that will have full tier 3.9 series might also have tier 3 but i dont remember. Too lazy to look it up.
I am. What's up?
Nope, 4790k at 4.4ghz, might try 4.7ghz soon.
Can't believe these tards bit
not suprising at all the 290X has the same draw call power as a TitanXto be fair though OP this does not translate into Framrate it merely depicts how much more shit you and populate in the world while maintaining render speedso essentially in a first person shooter the Nvidia cards drive faster but in a massive open world sandbox with metric fucktons of polygons beings rendered the AMD cards will be a much better on DX12 or a similar API
This is simply because AMD cards don't gimp out on FP64 like Maxwell, DX12 makes use of compute, Pascal will close the gap in late 2016 assuming TSMC doesn't fuck up again.. Like that's gonna happen, kek.
Finally i see this pic again. This makes me laugh every time.>Wealthy>Needs to save money for stronger GPU
>Wealthy>Needs to save $2 a month in electricity
More than all of /g/Everyone company cherrypicks benchmarks to suit them.
5960X here
... You're an idiotAre you dumb? This is how you know all the Intel fags are broke... No one with money is just going to throw money at stuff that they don't need unless its for bragging rights. People don't care about PCs that much... You wish your i54960k that's a poor fag. 8350 is a smart rich fag
>AMD Propaganda. Cherry picking benchmarks to the extreme<Insert brand name here> Propaganda. Cherry picking benchmarks to the extreme.Just saying AMD does that would serve nothing but show us how naive you are. All companies do this given the chance.

That wasn't about efficiency. That was about LITERALLY BURNING CARDSFucking underages.
Housefire meme was WAY before the driver which damaged cards was released. And even that didn't actually set them on fire.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QkyfGJgcwQ
In draw calls. And yes, everyone knows GCN achieves more draw calls, it was basically engineered to process low-level APIs. More drawcalls processing simply means the gap between the 290x and GTX 980 will be short. For the 390x on the other hand, these are great news, it means it will kick the shit out of the Titan X and the 980 ti.
Despite all this nvidia was still considered by the majority to be better.Objectively AMD was crushing nvidia at that time and they were still losing markershareThe fanboyism is real
one of the better ads AMD has made over the years.
It was because insane temps and actual card burning, not on fire yeah but they literally burned themselves.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRo-1VFMcbc
thank you, this is just what i need.
At least AMD fanboys have a sense of humour.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIPggCgYK38
That's a GTX 590 which was released a long time after GTX 480 where the housefire meme came from was released.GTX 500 series had SHIT VRMs compared to GTX 400 series and they literally gimped performance in torture tests to get around it.In the beginning when custom boards weren't available, overclockers were making frankenstein cards with GTX 480 VRM wired into a GTX 580 because the included VRM was useless.
Did you read what I posted about "insane temps since fermi" thing?That started the nvidia housefires.
I never said i'm not poor.>/g/>People don't care about computers.And i don't have i5. I already know from my own experience that current AMD CPUs are stupid... I'm waiting for both Skylake and Zen, because i'm not obsinate fan like you are. I still remember my excellent Athlon XP build.. Current AMD CPUs are good for rendering and stuff like this.. And of course there are few games that actually run better on FX CPUs, but in most games they get beat out by i3s..Right now AMD is not smart choice for gaming, only for whatever than actually can use all of its cores.
I know it was because of the insane temps, but it was the 480 that spawned the meme. Not the driver fiasco that burned cards or GTX 500 series which both came way after the meme was established.
>no driversThe most stupid shit ever. I bought a 960 GTX recently and had more issues than with 3 AMD cards before.Now what good DX12 games are there?
Didn't nvidia recently release a driver that had to be rolled back for most people?>muh more drivers>ignores the fact a good chunk of them are broken
Every new card has a lack of drivers, people spouting memes get hidden from me instantly.I spend more time hiding threads than browsing them.
>posts game benchmark to prove a CPU is shit or notIt's not like every 100+ cpu is bored in 99% of games. Oh wait.
AMD releases a lot of drivers aswell, they're Beta though, they don't bother doing WHQL drivers because people started crying about the lack of quality, so they decided to take longer to release certified drivers.The Beta drivers are just as good, just not certified, so far I never encountered a bug.
WHQL doesn't test for games.It tests for general stability in windows and windows-related tasks.It's stupid to even consider that shit for games.And in a business environment you want stable drivers that just work. Nobody gives a fuck about 3% increased performance in batmans creed in that industry.
Well, in a business enviroment you won't update your drivers after the very first time you setup the rig.The Beta drivers are good for those that do not want to wait and have their Software optimized before the WHQL release.
Actually..... I switched from a 290x and a 8350 to a 4790k and 970....the performance difference is insane. Much faster, more responsive, better graphics.... Yeah. I used to be AMD all the way... Now I can't go back.... Although I'll probably build a system with their new zen procs to test.

>mfw the rMBP13 is pretty much a MBA with a pretty screenIntel is so fucking sneaky with their SDP marketing, the rMBP13 and MBA both use exactly the same CPU/GPU.They both turbo-boost to almost the same frequencies. Both will hit 40W on peak loads. Intel just slaps a random low frequency and calls it a 15W SDP chip and another random but higher frequency and call it a 28W SDP chip.
Not a macfag tbh
l always use my HP in bed, 5 years running and never had issues with temperature
That's because your HP is better designed than a Mac.
because I have a cheap thinkpad
Because too many people who buy macs are either too lazy or stupid to look around for better deals. They'd be better off with a chromebook.
Bought new Working station and also had spare an t420 with an i7-2630qm, 8gb ram and SSD.Both working station and thinkpad were so fucking bulky to wear to work that i switched the thinkpad to a macbook air 11 and i fucking loving it.

Hello /g/. Not sure if this is the right board, but to be honest I have no idea which board would be right for this.Here's the story: a friend of mine received this item by mail from a Shanghai address. The envelope has various stickers and stuff in Chinese, so it appears legitimate. The mail was sent to him specifically, even including his mobile phone number. This was the only item in the envelope, and it's made of some kind of metal. So, the question is: what the hell is this thing?
Looks like a "finger ornament" for edgy kids
yeeeeees
Battle armor for your dong
install gentoo
Given the circumference of the rings I conclude it to be some manner of chinese cock torture device.
it's a decoy to distract you from the cutting-edge biological weapon that came in the same envelopebet you didn't even notice the almost microscopic powder that fell out when you tore it opennice knowing you, OP, you've got maybe three days to live
just online translate the chinese and find out
it appears to be some kind of copper coin.
There's no description, only a Shanghai return address and a bunch of Chinese mail stickers on the envelope.
I'm going to kill my fucking self!
It's the Cinderella slipper of cock rings. You must now travel to China and find the one chinaman with a cock that fits perfectly.

Do you suppose there could be any way to translate those strange hieroglyphs on it?

I joined it as well. It's software could be the future of trackers. Sadly, it doesn't actually have the TV I wanted to download (Miami Vice)
Good, all these archive fags will go the fuck away.
Yes oh god what if you get warned? Then what will you do? You won't be able to ascend the useless user classes for a whole number of days and uh, nothing else.
but I don't want to download music, I WANT RARE FILMS BREH. If I make a what account I have to download stuff and upload or keep a good seed ratio, then ask around for a KG invite.ugh, such a hassle to get invited there.
Nigga i've been seeing you post that pic on /tv/ since like december kek
It is a universal sign that the staff thinks your post is against the rules. By doing that the retard makes clear he does not care about them and will bend it as he pleases. What if someone keeps posting? Will he be banned?
dude, what the fuck. I've been trying to join that site for the longest. Hook me up bruh!
Then do somehting else. No one will spoonfeed you.

Don't try that under the guise of an opinion.>What if someone keeps posting? Will he be banned?NoI mean, unless they're posting some really retarded shit.Pretty much no though.
no

Banned is his title. He isn't banned
i'm even more mad that the latest one is actually from WCD cuz he messaged me recently.
In all these months those fags haven't fixed their shit or even downloaded wtf. I think you only had like 5 invitees back then. Don't even know why they ask for an invite if they don't have storage or something, it's like those poorfags sitting on a PTP account and not doing anything.

>It's software could be the future of trackersAgreeI noticed a bunch of similarities between what their own software is like and the ideas I had for a project our team are going to be starting soon (could suck since we'll probably get shit over not being 'original', but it should turn out well either way)
what's even MORE worse is the sitewide freeleech there was in december, i even messaged them all.
Fuck off, faggot. Nobody is going to invite you to KG.
If you have access to private trackers, you have a moral duty to reupload to public trackers.By putting up with byzantine rules and regulations to share content with others, you martyr yourself for the good of mankind.Fight copyright.
What do you think you're accomplishing?
whats a solid tracker that one can get into from WCD for TV? I noticed freshon closed its invite thread. I think it's time for me to graduate from IPT.
BTN
I haven't had my accoutn for six months quite yet unfortunately. Maybe I'll just stick with IP until then.
Wait it out then because nobody gives a fuck about anything TV-related except BTN. BTN is god-tier for TV. Only thing it's missing is old, very obscure TV that you can find on TV Vault.
Sounds good. Thanks for the help doug.

Is WCD the only way to get into the better private trackers? I've been idling in the BB invite channel for days now and interviewers don't seem to exist. Are there any other trackers with open signups that eventually have invite threads for the higher-tier trackers?
>Is WCD the only way to get into the better private trackers?Yes>I've been idling in the BB invite channel for days now and interviewers don't seem to exist.

Alrighty, guess I'll start studying those WCD interview notes. Thanks.
Good luck! it's really not that hard.
pls join what if you have something to contributeno huehuehue's or curryniggers pls
I have nothing to contribute, and I'm not really interested in torrenting music. Like at all. But since what is effectively the only way to get into the decent trackers, I'll have to pretend to care for a while.
what a twat of a personmonkey man honkey basterd
>Is WCD the only way to get into the better private trackers? I've been idling in the BB invite channel for days now and interviewers don't seem to exist.Just keep trying. It's an easier interview than the What.cd interview and you're going to have to wait even longer in line for an interview at What.cd.
>I have nothing to contribute, and I'm not really interested in torrenting music. Like at all. But since what is effectively the only way to get into the decent trackers, I'll have to pretend to care for a while.If you don't give a shit about music, don't take the What interview, because it's hard to survive on What once you get in after the long ass wait for the interview. If I were you, I'd keep trying for bB because once you find an interviewer, the interview is much easier than What's interview and you will be able to get into a lot of trackers much more easily by gaining ratio on movies, tv, etc. If I remember correctly, the best times are weekend afternoons US time, and weekday evenings US time.

It's worth joining if you're interested in 576p encodes, apart from that there's not much point in joining if you have access to either TehConnection, PTP, HDBits or A-HD.
Sounds like shit then. I'll avoid it. Thanks.
What's objectively the best designed private tracker, regardless of content?
Didn't want to make my own thread, so I'll ask here.I haven't used Torrents in years, but I need to download some game files.What's the go to bloat-free torrent client nowadays? I heard uTorrent went to shit.
Just use uTorrent 2.2.1 build 25302. It's the only uTorrent worth using and the only good Windows client.
Thanks.
What.CD?
Does anyone have a list of what trackers do internals for what groups?
brosted I would really appreciate a KG invite send me a message to this emailewbb8@notsharingmy.infoand I will send you all my ratio proofs before you send me an invite.
You can google that.
>15 ratio on iptaww babby
Which torrent software do you guys use for seedboxes? I'm running Transmission right now, but thinking of switching to rTorrent+ruTorrent because it's prettier... thoughts?
>not having any ratio because you only snatched freeleches
Using rTorrent on mine, because it has good plugin support and handles large numbers of torrents (>1000) well.
Using rtorrent+rutorrent with 519 torrents on a kimsufi ks-2 atm. runs pretty well
Is there anything I should avoid torrenting if I don't want to get sued, other than HBO shit?
Just use a seedbox and/or VPN. Your service provider might get a DMCA notice but they just forward it to you and don't give out your personal information. Then you just have to delete the files (or just stop seeding them) within 24h and that's it, no big deal.
Anyone know where to get an IPT invite? I'm a PU on what.cd but there's no thread there. (Because of tracker drama)
You either pay for it or get one from an invite forum. I've seen people give out IPT invites on CG and EMP.
why don't we make our own invite trading/giveaway threads ?anons send other anons emails using anonymous addresses and they trade invites after sharing ratio proofs before. something like this, I have a,b,c invites and want x,y,z invitesemail:trackermods@wants.dicksinhisan.usin screenshots only post ratio and today's date hide everything else if you're worried about being caught.
Ratio proofs are easily faked and there is no way to know that the person you are sending the invite to isn't just a staff member of a tracker trying to get you banned. Also it's easy as fuck to join almost every tracker so there is no point to risk your account for invite trading.
btpd is easy to automate and leave running. Also easier to interact with over SSH than rtorrent (no paging through thousands of torrents).
there are literally tens of forums who do that and to highest ranking tracker, no one ever gets caught
If you have linux, you should use deluge.
People get caught for invite trading all the time. Some people just get lucky. But as I said there is no point in risking your account if you can just join almost every tracker through recruitment threads.
rtorrent+pyroscope > btpd
>not rtorrent or transmission-remotewhat trackers have good recruitment threads other than wcd ?
BTN, PTP, HDBits, AHD
but satan, how are these mortals expected to get into those trackers in the first place
post the threads from any of their forums
>HDBits.ru .org or .com ?there are 3 fucking different hd-shits trackers
.orgJust join wcd through the interview. As a power user you can join A-HD. Then you can either join BTN through A-HD or through elite on wcd.PTP doesn't recruit at the moment but they'll probably open up recruitment again for elite on wcd in the next couple of weeks. Joining HD-Bits is close to impossible at the moment, they had a thread up on BTN for guru+ for a short while a couple of weeks ago.
When will I ever be able to get into Gazelle Games?
They recruit even on baconBits, it's so fucking easy to get there.
What project?
oppaitime i guess
Then say so in your post fag. State your conditions when you offer to do requests and stop getting butthurt. Nobody here is a beggar.
Why are you still here, indian shitposter?

>What.CD seedbox graphs are back to 1.5 GB upload a dayI mad.

>all these stalled torrents on oppaitimeSeed your fucking shit.
i have like half of the torrents on a seedbox, but a few of the people actually uploading only push like 50KBps totali can probably crossseed anything I don't already have going if you really want it, but I might as well let the people uploading things at least get some credit out of it
does Oppaitime have an Irc to get an invite ?
I'm seeding everything I upload but as  said, I only have a 60KB/s upload speed so it's gonna take quite a while.

You are absolutely right. Maybe next time.
I'm probably downloading a fuckton of manga from you man, I'l help you seed forever
not him, good movie thoughnot the best acid trip ever, makes you want to commit instant sudoku.
anyone need me to get anything off private trackers for them?
AB, Cardcaptors, original complete seriesI have BTN and it doesn't have it, and I don't watch anime so i wouldn't want to just join for 1 thing.
sorry i don't watch anime either so i don't have it ;-0
Ziad Rahbani albums from wcd if you can find them would be epic, Mp3 / 320 and V0 if 320 is not available. Just his solo albums/soundtracks not compilations his stuff is included in.

I'm pretty sure that BTN has CCS.
nice wasted buffer m8
i meant the US version, regular CC, 2000, i said original cardcaptors but didn't realize the one i watched wasn't original at all, but rather the american version i wouldn't be of any use if i just want 1 series.

Can someone give me tips on how to level up on Gazelle Games? What do I write on IRC to not get flagged as a spammer and make those thousands of lines. What about forum posts. Advise please.
Get better autism. Most forums are circle jerks anyway.
The tracker url changed and we're still getting users to update their torrent files. Send a re-seed request if nobody's seeding properly.

From GGN Do Not Upload List:Rapelay - Any members that upload this tasteless garbage will be banned.So is GGN confirmed for being run by faggy SJWs? Funny how they don't mind rape in all the other games that have it.
tasteless snuff != actual games with rape as a story development, etc
It's literally the same thing. You're watching pretend rape for entertainment. Just because you think your rape scene is le art doesn't change the fact that you're watching rape for entertainment. Faggy SJWs will never understand this. It's why they like MKX but not Hatred. As long as popular culture tells them something is okay they don't have a problem with it. However if it's not popular they sperg out about how it's so oppressive.
Yawn. I don't care, my man. Take it up with their staff if you really care.

Hey, can anyone look around for the source Project Diva F music videos? (not 2nd)  I've got the 9.55GB torrent that's on Nyaa and rutracker but it's been encoded and the audio is a mix of AC3, AAC, and FLAC 96kHz.It's not the end of the world if I have to transcode from that video since it's CRF=18, but I'd like to go from source.  I'm mostly interested in finding source audio since this FLAC pack I picked up is going to need a lot of work to get it to align with the video.
What's the artist?
You should make it a freeleech.
I would if someone would upload it.It's actually got really good h content. Not surprising, since it's an illusion game.Day 1 staff pick.
I want all of them.  Anyone who ripped them would have put them in a pack under Project Diva F.
I see. The source is a game and I'm not a member of any gaming tracker, sorry.
What's difficult to understand? Each bitrate will have a specified range. Like one of the mp3 ones have 16khz IIRC. If you see a spectral that has noise above this yet has a very distinct shelf at 16 then there is a good chance its a shitty transcode
How can I get in?
Have to be elite at wcd.
That's pretty gay
There's also a thead in the BTN Master forums.
I'm sorry, I'm a newfriend at all of this
Just give me your email and I'll invite you
You can always post a pic of your dick with "Azathoth" written on it on the irc channel.
You think you're joking but that's actually an entirely valid way of getting in

Seems like bait, no thanks. I want to be legit accepted
>Seems like baitYou have no idea how funny that is>I want to be legit acceptedHow exactly do you plan on doing that? Getting invited like this is the only way currently. There are no invite threads anywhere.
Its a gaming tracker, not a fetish game tracker you faggot. You are seriously worse than tumblr if you can't understand that a private tracker can decide not to have rape fetish games if they don't want to. Its the same as porn trackers saying no gay content.

SJWs got mad at SCC for banning gay porn. It was hilarious. They called the site homophobic for the staff there not wanting to have to deal with seeing gay porn on their tracker. I mean what kind of man would want to staff a tracker and deal with gay porn unless he were gay himself?
Could you invite me as well?e33DDe0IBA5BgF@cock.li
>Isn't it risky not to delete posts like that?Does the invite system not tell you who invited you?
Nigger stop deleting your posts. Oppaitime allows giving invites away publically. Nobody's going to catch you because you aren't breaking any rules
Rules say they don't though
It says no selling and that you're responsible for people you invite
Oh that's a relief, thanks again
While trying to install megatools from SSH I get the following error:*** Could not run GLIB test program, checking why...*** The test program failed to compile or link.

BTN isn't worth it. rutracker has most of what you are looking for. anything upped in the past year is avaliable on easier to get into trackers.torrent descriptions are among the worst i've seen. they still haven't implemented a better way to display mediainfo and there is no requirement for screenshots.the ratio system is alright, but hardly unique. their internal encodes aren't all that great.
If I can still get into it I might as well

Dude I have ultraseedbox too, you have SSH access, you can basically run whatever you want on it. Just download the files and stick anywhere on your home folder and then just execute them. If there are compilers installed you can even compile shit from source.You're trying to install it system-wide through the goddamn package manager like a dumbass. That's support ticket territory. If you want root access buy the VPS. They have unmetered bandwidth too! I would have bought one if they had 3 TB of storage.

I'm Mac illiterate these days. I was on a Mac from 2006-2008, then went PC, then went Mac again last month. Yosimite is different than the old OS, but it's still really simple and cool. Check out the app store. OR put a SSD in it. Maybe a RAM upgrade.Tips/easter eggs:There is a way to play Tetris in your terminal. Google how to do it. I don't know if it still does it, but theres a button combination you can push (something like CTRL+1293 or similar) that puts an old Mac model icon into what you're typing that will show up as an old mac icon to other mac users on the chan. On Windows/other, it shows up as just a small box. Nothing really that amazing. Windows computers on a local network show up as a blue screen of death on an old white PC CRT monitor. Like I said, I'm not that used to OSX these days.
it's called paintbrush.app

I'm not chatting shit.I own one and have owned one for years. There is no software that improves it.It will always get too hot.Performance will always be too poor for a computer this expensive.Install OpenEmu if you want it to burn your lap playing old games.Install MPV if you want it to burn your lap playing 1080p Chinese cartoon rips.Install Daisy Disk so you can see which Chinese cartoon rips and old games you're using the most space to burn your lap with and delete them to download new ones to burn your lap with.Pixelmator is a nice program to burn your lap with while making shiny 2D graphics.But don't worry, there are a few tools you can use that don't involve burning your lap. For instance, Sparrow is a much better Email client than the default Apple Mail, using that doesn't burn your lap (thankfully). Lingo is a nice IRC client that also doesn't burn your lap. Transmission is the finest non-lap-burning torrent client you can get as well.So basically as long as you're doing things notebooks from 15 years ago did just fine you can enjoy using your MacBook Pro without setting your lap on fire.

I'm new to linux and have an rMBP. What distro would work with the retina screen and not make everything tiny? I tried antergos on a live usb because I wanted to install it to an external hard drive and some stuff was still pretty small.
well you should start with understanding that you can install any wm or de on any "distort" of linux. they aren't mutually exclusive...................
I know, but if there's a distro that's better for me out of the box I'd prefer to use that one.
In that case I'm not entirely sure why you tried antergos. It is an arch based distribution, mainly for people who enjoy tinkering and blowing shit up.If you want something that 'just works' (but is perhaps harder to customise in the end) then look at fedora or linux mint.Not sure about support for retina though, you should google that.
>I'm not entirely sure why you tried antergosI tried it and Fedora. I decided I'll probably stick with antergos because it had the most driver support out of the box, my wifi didn't work with Fedora when I tried it on a live usb.
typical macfag
Fair enough. But I would caution you, antergos is more 'newbie' friendly until you want to do something that isn't the default. Then it just becomes pure arch really, with the only difference being that you didn't learn as much as if you were actually using arch.Also remember it is rolling release, so if and when something breaks you are going to have a tougher time if you don't know your system.This isn't me being elitist or whatever, it is just the truth about 'DIY' distros like arch.Anyway I hope you enjoy it, but if you make an effort to really learn and configure things yourself it is actually really fun :)

So a friend of mine gave me a beat up computer, literally, his girlfriend took a baseball bat to it and fucked it up good. I've tested most of the components and they all work with the exception of the motherboard/CPU. I can't confirm which is broken or if they're both shot because I don't have any comparable motherboards or cpus. Is there any way to determine which is defective? The CPU is an i7-2600k and the motherboard is a MSI P67-GD65 B3.>mfw I just got a Radeon 6950, a 1 terabyte harddrive, and 16GB of ddr3 for free

Your friend is a pussy whipped bitch
Probably the motherboard, unless she took the bat straight to the cpu
Doesn't really sound like that much damage, just the case and motherboard are destroyed.  If she didn't break the GPU the Cpu is probably fine.
This. High chance the CPU is okay
i honestly don't know but my bet is on the motherboard so that's the first i would try to replace.
Probably the motherboard. Unless she took a bat to it while it was on or something.
>Is there any way to determine which is defective?Take it to some store, ask them check it.
It's either just the motherboard, or both it and the CPU. The chances of the CPU being broken and not the motherboard after the case has been beat with a baseball bat are slim to none.
you'll have replacement parts when the selfish cunt is court ordered to pay for it.

https://sourceforge.net/blog/gimp-win-project-wasnt-hijacked-just-abandoned/>SourceForge has been hijacked; this project was actually abandoned over 18 months ago, and SourceForge has stepped-in to keep this project current.  For more details, read on…FUCKING KEK!tl;dr:When you abandon our jew platform we are entitled to continue your project on our behalf and mislead users by bundling malware with your binaries.
they did this multiple times right?
Filezilla people consented to that. GIMP-folks didn't.

From your distro's repositories.
>my distro and when im on windows?
Install from source. Check the hash of the source.
You can literally see the list of projects sourceforge has taken over if you want to avoid them. Sourceforge is kind of shit tbh. It's impossible to view without blocking ads.
the Filezilla guy willingly accepted and defended it, just take a look at the Filezilla forums
but this is why it can no longer be trusted we need an uncorruptable download sight the spreading of third party bullshit needs to be legally banned im so sick and fucking tired of "fixing" peoples computers by using the uninstall menu
>Check the hash of the source.What the fuck?Not everything's on git, you know.
The issue is that these sites stop being able to afford running without this shit. Instead of doing the smart thing, and work towards a premium service to pay the bills, well before its needed, they just twiddle their thumbs until the last second, and serve up obtrusive ads, and install PUP and malware along with software.
source forge can no longer be trustedWhere have you been? This has been the case for like 2 years or something.
They put cancer on Pidgin as well.  Someone should tell them that Pidgin users don't really want OpenCandy and RAT installers included with their multi-protocol messaging apps :(

Honestly, coming from a Galaxy user, I'm debating switching over to an Xperia once my contract is over. Those phones are fucking gorgeous.

>can't read the Sony logo on the middle phone Now how will people know that I'm more technologically knowledgeable than them :(


Only issue I'm experiencing with my z1 is that the touchscreen doesn't work properly with sweaty/wet hands, but awesome phone. Z1 is the best phone ive ever had
>buying anything sonyWhen will people learn?

>back magically destroys itself
Actually this happened to me yesterday.. I laid it softly on my mouse pad and when I lifted it up, it was broken
xXxKUSH420ROMMMxXx from XDA has less bugs than sailfish on non native hardware.
Square design looks like shit, and it's very uncomfortable to hold in hand compared to curved phones like Moto G/X, HTC M8.

These are the worst phones - my work has gone through 10 out of the 16 we bought from breaks and cracked screens.
lol
Kill self
What iOS apps Android doesn't have? I'm sure there are plenty of apps resembling their functionality in case devs haven't ported it for Android.
After the random screen/back cracks probably the second biggest flaw

Maybe you should be careful instead you retardThis has literally never happened to me
Do you think the Z3+ will have addressed these issues?

I thought the same but it grew on me and now I find it more comfortable
ZenFone 2 still better
The glass is too delicate, I've replaced the digitizer twice already.
Worst marketing strategy all Android phones.Poor commercial performance will eventually lead to Sony selling Xperia like they did with Vaio, specially now that Xperia is not only their only product that is in the red and also THE sole reason for sony's negative FY reports for two years in a row. If Kaz had pulled the plug on Sony Mobile a couple years ago Sony would've actually be a profitable company by now. Don't expect that division to last longer because I don't think Kaz will be able to handle investor pressure for long anymore.
Can't find any fails. Sent from my Z1C.  I'm new in Xperia land.
The only thing i dont like about them is the relatively small screen size percentage. Hope they improve that at least a bit with the Z5
don't upload to lolliprop if you know what's good for you bro
What port is that?
Too similar to my Z3.Not worth upgrading plus battery life takes a small hit. I literally just came back from work (left my house at 7 am) and 10 hours later, the battery is 82% on my Z3.
I never had this. I sometimes use my Z3 caseless and there are no cracks.
>port covers that become flimsy and looks like it'll tear apart after few weeks of use>overheating processor causing glass back to crack on its own>shitty software causing random lags
Lag? Mine is pretty smooth.The last device I used that was an absolute lagfest was the Galaxy S3.
Meanwhile I've had mine for like 3 months and not a single issue.
>phone falls from my hands in concrete facing screen>there is no hope now>screen is fine>back has a new spider webwhy
Different glass types? I think the front is Gorilla Glass while the back is something else.
It's not a Z3c
Come on OP, I like the xperia line, especially after the z3, but don't get shilly
infact i found some apps with functionality on android without working alternative for ios
Have Z3CLike:- the looks- size (perfect)- camera- speed- battery- magnetic charging port- camera button/power buttonDislike:- touchscreen has issues with start/end of touch event- earpiece/call quality not the best, sounds thin, not really loud- back slippery as fuck, would prefer plastic to glass but easily fixed with screen protector film- much bloat, takes few hours of work to freeze unnecessary shit
all good here
Clear back glass?
the original Z
yea, I took the white glass off and just scraped the paint off. Coulldn't do it on the nfc circuit at the top though
Looks interesting. If I ever break glass on mine will order new and scrape paint off.Reminds me of old clear case Palm Pilots.
I had a z3. I had it in my pocket when i was at work. I work as a line lead at a company that makes dialyzers. My job is basically to align, maintain, and repair machinery on a daily basis so that it runs properly. Somewhat like maintenance, but only on a single line over the course of a shift and with a different set of goals.Anyhoo, i was laying in the conveyor belt to get a good grip on a bolt so i could replace a part. My phone was in my front pocket at the time and when i stood up, it had shattered on both the screen and the back side, as well as bent slightly across the middle, like those iphone 6 pictures.I am not some huge landwhale of a man, im only 150lbs.Its a damn shame because that phone was awesome. It multitasked like a champ, never crashed, had a beatiful screen, and sony's overlay is fairly lightweight compared to the llikes of samsung and the piece of shit lg cheapo im currently posting from.I miss that phone, but considering the present state of sony's phone division, i've decided against getting another. We all know their phone division is all but doomed.Seriously sucks. I've had a z1, z1s, and that z3, and aside from my z1s getting stupidly hot, i really liked those phones.
HHGGNNNNI had a Handspring and the case was slightly translucent. But circuits also looked cooler back then.
I have ordered a new one as well so when I get bored of it I can go back to a nice white one
I bought a tech21 case with my Z3 after spending $500 for the phone I'd cry like a baby if it cracked. The case looks good and has a rubbery texture it was on sale at Tmobile.
my cousin has a xperia z1, I don't know if the back is made of glass in that model but my cousin dropped it many times even on concrete and it has only little scratches
I'd really like to get a z3c but the fact that sony mobile is bankrupt holds me back tbh

This is a real dumb one you guys.SSDs have a expected use life, yes?Is there any difference for the SSD if its running OS or a Game on it? If I play a game, which will be heavier use then a OS, will that shorten the life of the SSD faster?

just bought my first smartphonerecommended settings?do sounds eat a lot of battery (such as when typing or selecting something?)Should i 'restrict background data'?
From my experience, screen lighting is one of the most battery consuming things. Just keep it dimmed whenever you're not in full sunlight.And really just turn off anything you're not currently using.
The confusion comes from the use of the phraze 'sensitivitiy'. When speaking in context of a mouse 'sensitivity' refers to the literal DPI of the mouse. It is worth noting however that 'sensitivity switching' would refer to changing the DPI of a mouse in order to alter how fast it moves on the screen.(eg. lowering the DPI to make the mouse move slower)In the context of software and applications it means how fast the application itself allows the mouse pointer to move accross the screen. No matter how you change the sensitivity of the application the accuracy(DPI) of the actual mouse will never change.If you want to experiment set the sensitivity an application to it's lowest setting (best example is in a video game) and drag the mouse accross the screen using a low DPI and high DPI mouse. In the case of a low DPI mouse you will see the pointer skipping across the screen slightly because the mouse itself does not have the accuracy to detect any smaller movements.
How do you get C++ programs to run in something other than a command window?
Write a GUI
ok thats what i thoughthigher DPI means less skipping

Windows and other graphical elements are operating system resources. You need some GUI library that uses Windows API. Something like Qt, WxWidgets, MFC, dotNet etc. Or you can just use winapi yourself. There are some cool elementary guides online.

Many Linux-based router firmwares allow you to adjust the transmission power. How do they do that?I just got my desktop computer, running Gentoo, working as a wireless router using hostapd, dnsmasq and nftables. I want to reduce the transmission power so that the network is only available inside my tiny apartment, and not to the entire apartment complex. With my last router I had transmission power set to 1% of maximum and that was plenty. It doesn't seem to be an option in hostapd, although hostapd does seem to be able to control transmission power, since it has a localization option that says that it will limit transmission power to the legal maximum in your country.
If it's not encrypted then you should assume that anyone with physical access to it can read it.

I'll be buying a new rig mid-summer, do you think the release of Skylake will push down the prices of earlier processors?I'm going to be putting a 4690k in this new rig, and there's currently a sale going on where I can get a 4690k for £155 (down from like £180). Is it worth me buying this early because of the sale, or wait until after Skylake is released?
Judging by your lack of understanding you'll probably find a way to get a virus no matter what.
Depends on what you're downloading.The price reduction on older gen processors will be very minimal if any. Expect $10 discount on previous generation or something.Wait until Skylake.
Should have mentioned, when I said "wait for skylake" I meant wait for the release and see how it changes the earlier processor prices. I won't actually be buying a Skylake processor.
Get it now then. Prices on previous generation will not drop that much.
Alright, thanks mate.
Yeah, if you want significant savings on last gen stuff you'll have to look at the second hand market.

What are some good books or online tutorials that teach linux in depth or linux for advanced users?Like what's linux's equivalent of window's registry?
/sci/ isn't responding, so I might as well try /g/:Where does vacuum permittivity come from? I get that an electrical field is produced by photons acting as force carriers for a point charge. These are emitted in all directions equally, i.e. in a spherical shape, and as the surface area of a sphere is 4*pi*R^2, you get the following formula for an electrical field:E = Q / (4*pi*R^2)Which is stranghtforward enough. You might need a dimensionless proportionality constant depending on units chosen, but that's it. However, in reality, there's a non-dimensionless vacuum permittivity factor, which both reduces E's value and changes its units. Where does this come from? Surely there's nothing in a vacuum that's intercepting photons, and even if there was, why would it affect the units?

Is it safe to drink from a soda can that the bottom part is bulging out and I squeezed it and it felt like the pressure is higher than it should be?Could it be botulism or something?

Is Seagate really that bad?Convince me why I shouldn't get the Seagate Archive HDD ST8000AS0002 (8TB)It's only $299, $37/TB
yes, buy a western digital.Going cheap for crucial parts while destroy your life.
Seagate is fine. I have yet to have a seagate drive fail on me, and they are generally faster than WD's noisy ass blacks while costing less.
That hard drive report says Hitachi are significantly more reliable than both WD and Seagate.
As long as you don't use it as a primary hard drive that's always connected, and use it instead like VHS backup tape to store stuff periodically in case of critical failure, you should be fine.A particular problem that's getting more apparent with larger storage volumes is unrecoverable sector failures, and such. All HDDs are manufactured to a specification that on average, each bit accessed has an X% chance of critical failure, meaning the entire data block associated is dead and gone.As hard drives get bigger, this fault tolerance doesn't also grow with it.If a 1TB was x% reliable after writing to every bit once, then an 8TB is only 8x% reliable after writing to every bit once.And not only that, but in the case of critical failure on a 1TB disk, you only lose 1TB data. In the case of critical failure on the 8TB disk, you lose 8TB data.Roughly, that means you could (in theory) have an 8x larger chance to lose 8x as much data if the drive just outright dies on you.Therefore, in larger storage volumes, it becomes increasingly more important to safeguard with data redundancy (RAID, unRAID, Z-RAID, etc), rather than going for big single disks.This is true.
I was just about to make this exact thread.  Seriously considering one of these for my video archive but I don't know if they can be trusted.
I repair computers and the amount of Seagates that fails is like 1 every 20 issued HddsI've found issued WDs and maxtors as well, at a ratio of 1 every 50 or soI cant say any other brand with severe problems other than those two in last year
If you need a random number generator, Seagate is awesome
>As long as you don't use it as a primary hard drive that's always connected, and use it instead like VHS backup tape to store stuff periodically in case of critical failure, you should be fine.Why exactly is that?As for big vs small, over time you'll loose just as much data. You'll just loose it in smaller chunks if you go for small HDDs. Backup is essential no matter if you have big or small HDDs.
Which one is true?Also, this is the first drive with shingles or what ever they call it, so old data isn't necessarily relevant for these drives.
If you want bullshit anecdotal advice, the only ~10 drives I've ever seen fail in my life have been Western Digital.
Well, the drive I'm gonna replace it with is a Seagate 2TB..
That reports bad sectors btw..
Still going strong after 5 years.
Which means nothing
Western digital and Seagate are fine for plebs. Get a hgst deskstar.
>Which means nothingAccording to these guys, it's pretty much dead:
I have drives that have been running for 10+ years with "bad sectors"That is called autism
>buying shingled drives>0x7DFKill yourself
You shouldJust don't use it for critical stuff
oy vey
>looseThis triggers me.
I'm sorry anon. English is my second language. If your upset, that was not my intention.
NO NO NO, you will regret it honestly.Do not buy Seagate, their drives are shit, google "Seagate failure rate" and get reading for top jokes!I work in IT, all the drives that I ever see fail are always fucking Seagates. The company I work for does not use or allow Seagate drives in anything as a company policy. The failure rates in some drives are just a piss take.Fujitsu currently have at least one court case against Seagate, probably more manufacturers do as well as a result of these failure rates.Pic related is my own picture. Two of those drives failed on the same day, from different computers, from different clients. Fuck Seagate seriously
So I have 3.75TB worth of hard drives that are getting filled and I need more space but have no more open SATA slots. I'm also worried about losing data due to drive failures. What should I do?I currently have 3x 1TB WD Blues, 1x 750GB Hitach 2.5" drive, and a 128GB Samsung 830 SSD.
>Spin Retry Count > 0Yep, that's a dying drive alright, that's a sign of mechanical failure.
First one looks like normal early failureBuy a SATA card
>8 terabytes on a seagate...for archives, implied, important stuff you plan to keep.i really like your style, anon. please feel free to stay on /g/. ಠ ٻ ಠ
You could buy more internal drives, buy an external drive caddy/mount or NAS enclosure. Connect them via USB3 or whatever.Or buy a PCI SATA card, and add more drives internally, buying 3.5" HDD mounts if you need to.
Funny, it's been running for best part of 2 years with most of those errors, it's not infant errors either. They've slowly built up over time, I've been waiting for it to tip over the edge and snowball into oblivion.. keeps on tricking though.
I have had a 320gb, 3 x 500gb, and 2 x 2TB sea gate barracuda. All are years old and never failed me. I also set them to never power down in windows.I have had to data retrieval on approximately 6 wetback shitfall drives now. With 2 of them being unrecoverable.Lesson of this story is that everything is circumstantial. Just because you had a bad experience doesn't mean sea gate makes bad drives.
Enjoy of loosing 8TB of data!
there not that bad. I use one as my main drive and it's been running great for over 30k hours now
I've pulled out 3 of 4 500GB seagates from my fleet within this past year, I dunno about the other ones but FUCK THE 500GB Seagates, they were all different years, different models too.I have 1 WD 808GB starting to throw errors in smart that's 1 out of 7 different WD drives I have online atm.I retired all but 1 of my Hitachis due to old age and small capacities. Now that Toshiba has Hitachi's old factories from that WD sellout, I'm starting to buy Toshiba drives along with WDs for new drive deployments, so far, so good.Currently have 11 drives online 8 drives offline, and an assortment of other old drives doing different things in different deployments, off the top of my head I can remember about 6, including 1 Maxtor and 1 ExcelStor.So atm I own a about 25 drives ranging from 80gb to 3TB from Seagate, WD, Maxtor, ExcelStore, Hitachi, Toshiba.
I have a 30k hour one
55k seems to be pushing it tho
Personally I think there is a relation between power cycles on a drive and a drive failing.My drives have very low power cycle counts with decent hours.A lot of drives that come in to be replaced have low hrs, huge amounts of power cycles.
agreed - to a point anyways
Because it puts strain on the drive mechanism? Google's study years ago statistically proved this.
>Convince me why I shouldn't get the Seagate Archive HDD ST8000AS0002 (8TB)If you actually have 8TB of data, you're a fucking loser that's gone too far off the deep end and should re-evaluate your life.
Here I thought content was king, when apparently it's grapes.
which program shows the hours?
Gotta have a good selection of shows and movies in case the internet ever goes down for a bit
Statistically seagate drives have the highest failure rate. WD is the most reliable. They all buy platters from the same factory in China. WD buys higher quality and runs more QC on their drives. Look it up. Thats why you pay 50% more.
Will*Retard
That was like a full laundry basket of shit you just pulled out of your ass.
>Is Seagate really that bad?Yes, and the higher number of platters in a given drive model, the higher the failure rate.  An 8TB Seagate sounds like a recipe for disaster.  If you're buying two 8TB drives and using one for backup, I'd say that's a reasonable plan.
>trusting ANY hard drive>not having at least RAID 1 with zfs
Crystaldiskinfo, or any SMART program30k here
Nigga you have a sample size of six.
>NOBODY EVER NEED THAT MUCH DATA IF YOU DO YOU'RE A FUCKING SHITLORD NEET TURBOVIRGINI can think of many professions where you store data of that magnitude. OP never said what it was for.
because your setting yourself up for a failure with multiple rattling disks inside
>youreven if you're memeing this triggers my autism.
I have 5 TB of data, 1TB of which is irreplaceable, 2TB which is important but not irreplaceable and 2TB which is replaceable.I just bought a Seagate Barracuda 4TB. It's on sale and I have a 3TB for backup. The sustained write performance due to SMR on the 8TB was just too low me (<40 MBps), as well as the limited write cycles.All in all this was a good day.Review of the 8TB drive here:http://www.storagereview.com/seagate_archive_hdd_review_8tb
Nice trips. I'm sorry for triggering you're autism anon.
Working at a repair shop for the past 3 or so months and literally all the drive failures I've had to deal with are Seagate and I cannot imagine that WD or Hitachi (HGST) aren't being sold to my area.While obviously Seagate drives aren't the only ones to ever die, in personal experience and on data provided by different companies/people (Eg. BackBlaze), they seem to be the least reliable of the three main companies.
I have about 10TB spread over 11 drives.Sometimes I wish I had less drives because of the power drain though.
Soon, rally soon, 10TB SMR drives will be out. Buy two of those (~$400 each) and consolidate all your drives. Ebay/sell all the 1TB ones. With the resell value of those 11 drives and the power savings, the total investment won't be that bad.
Actually it's 3 main companies with 4 brands.SeagateWD/HGSTToshibaIn the places that don't sell Toshiba it's just two companies.WD/HGST and Seagate.WD bought Hitachi but was forced to sell off Hitachi's 3.5" division to Toshiba and retained the 2.5" division. WD retained the Hitachi brand name though and now it's Hitachi Global Storage Tech.
Two drives, where one is for backup if that wasn't clear..
I'd probably have to keep some of them as my drives are mostly full.I just recently pulled out all of my drives under 400gb and consolidated them into 1 3TB drive, thinking of pulling all the 400~500gb drives next but still holding out in hopes of cheap 4TB drives.
People say Seagate is bad all the time but I have 3 external Seagate drives and I have yet to see any problems with them. One of them is an elder 500gb 3.5" model that was under heavy usage all the time too.
what is SMR? sounds like something that would last forever but the disks are still subject to physical failurean can you wipe the data?
3 isn't enough to collect real data. It is fact they are the least reliable. I cannot imagine BackBlaze faking their data for giggles.
If a drive idles at 5W and they run 24/7, assuming 12 cents per Kilo-Watt hour you pay roughly $5 per year per HDD. That's $50 per year in your case.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingled_magnetic_recordingAnd yes you can.
>And not only that, but in the case of critical failure on a 1TB disk, you only lose 1TB data. In the case of critical failure on the 8TB disk, you lose 8TB datayou would have it backed up anyway so what would that matter
Could be far higher if in Europe (Eg. Denmark at $190 and Germany very close).
It's 22 cent per kwh here.I do run 24/7 though, I have my HDDs in 8bay standalone enclosures so they remain on even when my computer power cycles.
That's almost $100 a year in electricity cost then, + a little extra (+1W-ish per drive) when reading/writing. But then perhaps the heat is offset by the heating bill in the winter?At any rate, the time for an upgrade is here..
I live in the sub-tropics, I've never ever had a heater. Heck it's 30C atm with humidity at 90% on the barometer.In the winter it still averages around 20C or so.Haven't had to buy any long sleeve clothing since I moved here 15 years ago.
>12 cents per Kilo-Watt hourWow what a ripoff.
But then you pay for the AC, right?
I usually don't  use A/C, it costs too much.Drives averaging 31~49C
I envy you. Norway here.
You won't when you have to live in 30+C temps, 70% humidity when the AC is on and feeling hot, wet and sticky 10 out of 12 months in an year.
I guess not. What do you store on your 10TB setup in the tropics, anon? Also, do you live close to nature or in a city?
I live in the city.I store things from ISOs, pictures I took, work and business related archival, music, weeaboo related things, etc, I don't collect movies though.Sometimes I have to hold on to things for other people too.
Do you have a decent DSLR? Flatbed scanner?
I used to have a DSLR, and I use the scanner from my AIO.
Okay, nvm then. Nice talking to you, best of luck with your array.
I don't have as many hours on my vintage 2005 disk.>dat power on count tho
>Is Seagate really that badNot really, they had some bad drives ages ago, WD has had bad drives too.>Convince me why I shouldn't get the Seagate Archive HDD ST8000AS0002 (8TB)180TB MAXIMUM I/O per year (read AND Write), any more invalidates the warranty.It's a drive designed for cold-storage of data, not for anything else.
what would be considered a "huge" amount of power cycles?
WD has the lowest failure rates, so if you have to buy a mechanical HD, thats my advice. WD not only buys better quality platters they also do longer QC on the drives after they've been combed, which is why they are more expensive and more reliable.
Don't do it anon. I made this mistake last year. Shit out on me 6 months in.
Hitachi (nowadays Toshiba) is the one with the lowest failure rates
this
>30+C tempsBeautiful, anything less is too cold.>70% humiditynopingrightout.webmI love the hot weather, but typically when the mercury starts hitting above 30c, we're sitting on less than 20% humidity (the lesser the better)Dry heat is best climate.
I have about 7 TB of storage that is nearly filled up, but that's spread across various 1-2 TB drives. I'd be interested in replacing it by larger drives just so I can get more without having to invest in a special extension card/controller.
Seagate has been really bad ever since the flooding in thailand.They resumed production in a new plant faster, and they didnt bump their prices up as much as everyone else. They have been the cheapest since then.Seagate didnt have a bad reputation before the flood, and its universally been shit since then.Either they are cutting corners that hurt their reliability, or its a huge elaborate conspiracy by other HDD companies.
Hitachi is owned and made in the same factories as WD.
Seagate had problems with their HDD that had higher capacity but it seems that it's getting better. I myself had a HDD for 6 years before switching it, now I'm using it as an external drive and still no problems with it.
Bull fucking shit. Seagate has been shit since they bought out maxtor. Their enterprise stuff was fine, but consumer grade anything kills itself within a year under very light use
Do larger hard drives have a higher rate of failure? I carelessly used a 150GB seagate for the better part of a decade before it finally died. I've been using a 2TB for about six months now and I'm still somewhat paranoid about it.
Hi there! You seem to have made a bit of a mistake in your post. Luckily, the users of 4chan are always willing to help you clear this problem right up! You appear to have used a tripcode when posting, but your identity has nothing at all to do with the conversation! Whoops! You should always remember to stop using your tripcode when the thread it was used for is gone, unless another one is started! Posting with a tripcode when it isn't necessary is poor form. You should always try to post anonymously, unless your identity is absolutely vital to the post that you're making! Now, there's no need to thank me - I'm just doing my bit to help you get used to the anonymous image-board culture!
>Do larger hard drives have a higher rate of failure?1 platter drives like 1TBs have gotten pretty reliableOnce you start adding more platters, the reliability does drop.
Hopefully it'll be fine. I've been considering buying a new HDD from a more reliable manufacturer but no sign of anything bad has happened so far and I'm not exactly flush with cash at the moment.
>buy SSD and install OS on it which is much fater>2tb sees a lot less useWin win
That's a bug in hdtune. Use crystal disk info.
WD got Hitachis technologies. Toshiba got hdd manufacturing.
Huh, that honestly hadn't occured to me. How simple is it to move the OS onto an SSD while retaining everything else on the HDD?
I have a samsung evo 840, I know both the Evos and Pros actually come with OS cloning software on a cd.I didnt use it, I did a fresh install so I have no clue how well it works.
Just got one after my segate 2tb died, it's loud as hell but it's alot faster it seems.
With SSD you may need some spacial settings regarding limiting writing operations mostly plus some other stuff like scheduled TRIM maybe. Really simple to configure under Linux, no idea how it works for Windows.
Windows 7 and 8 both have been updated and configured to TRIM and other shit out of the box.
Here's mine! About 3 - 4 years AFAIK.
This is my Seagate 320gb drive. Is this an anomaly?
No, it's just /g/ shilling.
Is WD Greens really that bad? Planning to use it maybe torrenting several times a week and watching videos, if that's all I do then it won't die off?

There's nothing wrong with Seagate.2TB Barracuda still going strong after 4-5 years.
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/17/backblaze_how_not_to_evaluate_disk_reliability/That graph is a load of shit.
Anything with a couple thousand power cycles is too much, a couple hundred power cycles per with 30000 hrs is already alot.
My ST2000DM001 2TB died only after 1.5 years. It had an insane reallocated sector count, like 20000, and other 5 more errors. Whatever, im considering this one:DT01ACA200  2TBIt's a Toshiba and they use Hitachi pieces so should be good. Definitely expect it to last more than the Shitgate.
Are 2.5" externals as reliable as 3.5" ones for archiving stuff without having to worry about losing everything?I'm thinking of buying a pair of them to keep my movies/tv shows. Would that be a wise choice?
Just for warning, WD uses custom PCB on their 2.5" external disks.

The math and theoretical CS are even more laughable. The only people who complain about their hardness are those stereotypical video game retards who already failed their math classes in high school. All the "muh logical quantifiers", "let's mindlessly apply this symbolic manipulation algorithm", "oh wow, an automaton represents a language" or "holy shit, how do I show this algorithm does what it does" babby crap is shallow and hardly deserves to be called university level. A mathematician or a physicsist who is trained in reading definitions, theorems and proofs can pick up all of a BSc computer scientist's theoretical CS much more indepth by spending one or two afternoons of reading a book. The worst thing however are the people going for such a degree. Out of all degrees CS seems to attract the most anti-intellectual scum. I seriously wonder how these people even managed to enter university. Every retard who barely passed high school and spends most of his day playing video games seems to think the must study CS. There are socially inept neckbeards of the retarded variety, hating and repeatedly failing math as well as the most simple programming assignments. There are dumbasses whose high school diploma was too bad to go for an economics degree, hence why they want to enter the business monkey route of CS in the hope of getting a little more than minimum salary. Those are of such subhuman IQ that they do not even understand the semantics of an implication in propositional logic.

Why do phone manufacturers obsess with these large screen sizes?I recently got a shitty low end 3.5'' HVGA android for $60 to use as a backup device just to find that I prefer it on a day to day basis to my expensive 5'' device. It does most of the stuff I do on my larger phone flawlessly with the enourmous upside of being one-hand friendly. Even movies are quite OK, you hold it a couple of inches closer and the virtual screen size becoms the same. Didn't  realise just how ergonomically awkward everything has become since I got this phone.My dream device would be a midrange android phone max 3.5''-4'', max 62 mm width, max 115 grams weight, dual or quadcore, WVGA res would suffice, water and dust proof.Am I alone in this world?(Pic somewhat related,  never owned an iPhone but I think the 5s is hits the upper limit for comfy one-hand usability.)
Larger devices are better equipped at things other than making phone calls and texting e.g. media consumption and gaming. LOL SMARTPHONEZ.
Realise that but still don't understand why there isn't a market for really compact devices with better specs than what's on offer now. Being able to tap the whole screen area with a single thumb is seriously underestimated in everyday use.
>Am I alone in this world?No. But you are stuck with 2012's best hardware. I suggest a Razr i.
Filthy Manlets, fuck off.
Nigga, you poor.
http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_i_xt890-reviews-4998.phpHey that looked really interesting, thx. They rolled out KitKat on it according to user comments.Battery's not replacable though, sucks if you want to pick up a used one.
Nigga you stupidI've got a large flagship device, read the first fucking post.
Some manufacturers do provide this, Samsung is one of them.The phones aren't as high speced as their flagship models (because you can't fit as much in etc) but they are still quite good.Apple will release a smaller phone in their 7th generation because they are retarded, giving three size options.
my dream phone/specs1) mid range pricing2) max 4.7 " screen (IPS/Amoled)3) gorilla screen protection alike4) removable SD5) Optional Dual SIM Variant6) snappy UI, NOT lagdroid7) Stable and fast locking GPS.Is this too fucking much to ask in 2015?
though all samsung's I can find that are not shitty specced are 4.3 and above, and that's on the large side imo.
>My dream device would be a midrange android phone max 3.5''-4'', max 62 mm width, max 115 grams weightlike your dickseriously, you can't even handle a 5 inch phone? lel fucking manlet. i man-handle my 6.4" sony xperia z ultra with ease. why are you even complaining, there are plenty of mini phones on the market for kids like you, no one is forcing you to buy a big boy phone.
seriously mate, 3.2" is two non-fat thumbs in width, that's fucking tiny, i'd call 4.3" the bare minimum of what's tolerable for an adult male to use
>two non-fat thumbstwo non-fat thumb widths
One of the major problems is battery size.The closer you get to high spec in relation to current flagship models the more power you need to to provide it so it will hit the target battery life, and with replaceable batteries in particular this increases their size, and then you need to fit everything around it.If they dumped the user replaceable battery on the smaller devices they could increase the specs without affecting the size that much as they gain space back from the battery bay and shit, but everyone wants a user replaceable battery.
>there are plenty of mini phones on the market.Yes, with crap low qual hvga screens. Can't find a kitkat or lollipop phone at 4 inches or lower with a good screen, at least 1GB of ram and an OK soc
Not asking for flagship specs, just a notch above crap specs and crap build quality in a compact pocket friendly package
That's the Z3 Compact. Down to the last point.
z3 compact is nice if 4.6" is alright, the bezels aren't big and it's very thin so it's not all that much bigger than some of the smaller phones
You're completely right. The phone market has gone batshit and merged itself with the tablet market, leaving very little for people who want a phone to actually be, well, a phone. The best form factors are flips and ~4 inch slates. Everything else is shit.
>5) Optional Dual SIM VariantZ3 Compact, not dual sim
no. lg l5 II Dual reporting init would be awesome if it had mid/high range specs (at least a dual core beacuse its single core cpu is painfully slow sometime; hd display and a much better camera; but the one it has now takes decent photos for that kind of phone) and a better build materialsit feels so well on my hand, can be used with one hand without problems. handy extra button that can open whatever you assign it to do.
I'd love to see you tracking your running w that one. 4'' and below is the sweetspot for sports tracking, lodges in your hand so you don't need one of those but ugly smartphone holders on your arm
Oh, I thought there was. Apparently it's only for the big Z3 variant.
what xperia phone is that on the right?i wasn't aware there was an xperia model bigger than the note 3
The low end device I got is an lg L40. It's dual core so pretty snappy but the downsides are the 512 mb ram and lacklustre hvga screen. Form factors just perfect though, it matches the good old iPhone 3gs almost on the mm.
It's the Z Ultra
It's the Xperia Z Ultra

Closest is the Lumia 640, but it's 5 inch.
Yeah sorry, but no. I'm in a healthy relationship and been so for more than 5 years.There are almost zero options for a girl. A 4.7-6 inch phone looks stupid on them. They can't reach 35-45% of their screen.

>There are almost zero options for a girl. A 4.7-6 inch phone looks stupid on them. They can't reach 35-45% of their screen.You say this like there aren't millions of girl sized Asians using those exact phones.
sorry but women like big phones, here in my country any women who doesn't use an iPhone 4/4S uses a fuckhuge phone with 5.5 to 6 inches + cover.Even I am replacing my iPhone 6 for a 6+ or a Nexus 6 because of the screen size, big phones are nice.d
Doesn't change anything to the fact that they look stupid. But oh well, I guess they need to fill their ridiculous big bags with something. I'm just glad my girl isn't anything like that.Btw, 5" is the max for me too. Anything bigger is plain stupid; That just my opinion of course.I would rather have a 4" smartphone with up to date specs and a 8-10" tablet for the same price as a fucking 6" phone.
Glad to hear you enjoy small penises. There is hope for everyone in this world.

>A 4.7-6 inch phone looks stupid on themusually i'm not a SJW fag but nice fucking objectification you judgmental retarded cunt. i don't care if some vapid girls "look stupid" using their phones. how fucking petty are you to even care about something like that?
i switched some time ago from nexus 5 to BB Q10. I agree with you: maybe at first it felt kinda cheap, but now i don't understand how i was able to navigate on this enormous screen without random bursts of rage.(i also don't understand how i was able to navigate without gestures, hub and other blackberry interface elements but i don't want to start argument about it there)I hope someday it'll roll back to previous state, as in case of those 9999mpx cameras that finally stopped being fun - and now in every proper device we have reasonably big matrix with better optics instead.I remember when i laughed about friend's gsm-equipped 10' tablet because there was application in system for making calls(of course i understand why, it was a joke, idea of using it as everyday phone). Maybe i was wrong, maybe it's the future.
And yet it's 100% correct. You're actually using a tablet that can make calls.
So it is a phone.You make it sound like there is some kind of arbitrary physical dimension limitation on what can be considered a phone.
>put GSM radio equipment in a pogostick>it's a phone!
If it makes calls, sure. It may be the only pogostick phone in the world but it is still a phone.
Your post is literally whining of a sjw asswipe.If you "don't care if some vapid girls look stupid using their phones", then fuck off and don't waste anyone's time. If we have any actual girl right here in this thread and that guy somehow pissed her off then let her speak.And stop objectifying "vapid girls" IMMEDIATELY. They can read, think and make posts too, you know? Why do you feel the need to patronize them? You feel better than them, you shitlord? You think they're lost without your guidance? Huh???
if i'll strap battery, arm board and usb gsm module to 22' monitor, will i get phone in result?
>You think they're lost without your guidance?says the fag who decides that a 4.7-6" phone is too big for them
So long as you can make calls it is a phone.
>Your post is literally whining of a sjw asswipe.>And stop objectifying "vapid girls" IMMEDIATELY.go take some more estrogen fag
i think you may be the only person in the world who defines "phone" this way.
>people are now arguing about whether or not members of the other sex should be offendedJesus Christ.
Says the fag who isn't a girl, never was inside a girl, yet feels the vital need to speak in the name of all girls who might be horribly offended by the fact that some guy in some thread thinks that 4.7-6" phones might be too big for some of them.Nice going, sjw.

>a phone isnt a phone because it can make phone callsJesus, what is the definition then?
Well, obviously the problem here is definitions. You're happy to call anything that can make calls a phone. I say a phone must have the primary purpose of making calls and be designed to some extent around that purpose.Just as obviously, you're wrong.
Don't you feel retarded for not understanding really basic sarcasm? Holy shit.
>You will immediately cease and not continue to access the site if you are under the age of 18.
weneedtogodeeper.pngCan we get an argument about whether or not we should be arguing about whether or not the other sex should be offended?
So why aren't large phones considered phones?They're designed around being phones, they just have a large screen for extended purposes.
No, at this point they're designed around apps, and have been for a while.
i wasn't speaking for girls, i was speaking for me. i insulted him because he's an egoistic lowlife for dictating that girls should use phones of a certain size just for his viewing pleasure. fucking retard.
But then that makes every current phone not a phone.
>being a manlet
Exactly. The only actual phones on the market are feature phones and small (<4") slates. And even the latter is questionable.
So basically, you want everyone to go by your arbitrary specifications.

I just want a flip phone with proper 3g capability, good battery life and end to end encryption. This is apparently too much to ask.
Go to Japan.
Their phones all have shit battery life and don't work on some key 3g bands in my country. They also seem to be trying to merge flips and slates, getting the worst of both worlds.
I'm a (somewhat) small statured female.I can use a Note 4 just fine.
I didn't tell you to come back.
Then don't you think it would work much better to just make some harsh fun of that self proclaimed ALL WOMEN EVER EXPERT instead of throwing around zomg so seriose terms like "objectification" and similar shit? You wasted your own posts, my posts and that whole time I could just spend fapping to hentai with trilobites.
Japan has also only barely heard of this strange new concept called "unlocking". It's all disposable fashion network locked shit over there.
With one hand only?
What flips? All phones I saw there are iPhones and some random all-touch JDM (Sharp, Panasonic, Kyocera) Android phones.
>hentai with trilobitesI'm sickened yet curious.
My phone is an LG L41c and it hits all these specs. Tracfone only though but I think the LG L70 is a close cousin. I actually have an L70 case on it right now and it fits perfect. The phone is great for everday use and is indeed the perfect size.
That's more due to the fact you're stuck on contracts anyway.
why does this matter? do you stand on a bus like a peasant?
Things like this:https://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/english/product/feature_phone/index.html
Flip phones are still hugely popular in Japan, Apple and Android phones are pushing into the market but you can easily find lots of people using flip phones and them in stores.If you actually looked.But I bet you didn't.
after sitting on my ass for 8 hours at work, I actually prefer standing in public transport.
Nope. Of course.One-handed usage is not my biggest priority.
Lean against something.
I did see flip phones. Only old people use them.
Confirmed for narrow spectrum of the population polled.Where did you go in Japan?
Mostly around the Kanto area.
I like to have a cup of coffee in one hand while at the same time being able to answer a call, write a mail, do a Google lookup without looking like a spastic
Is that all?
Put the coffee down. The fact you're doing this standing on a bus just makes it even more dangerous.
I'm not doing this on a bus, you're mixing me up with another anon
>there are people here who actually consider phones this size to be too bigAbsolutely disgusting.
You all look ridiculous trying to edc 5in+ phones. Most everybody I see where I love has iPhone 4s or 5c or Samsung s4. The only people with bigger phones are either compensating for something or they don't have to move around much in their day-to-day lives so their phone just sits on a table most of the time or is carried out in the open leaving them with only one free hand at all times unless they put their phone down on a table.
You make it sound like 5in+ Phones don't comfortably fit in even a jeans pocket.
I'm someone who regularly emails from my phone. I put my coffee down because I like typing with both of my thumbs.
I swipe with one thumb
>ten foot tabletNow that's getting ridiculous
>2015>not wearing jeans your size
I would but I can't find size 28s anywhere.I make do with 30s though.  They're only a little bit loose around the waist, hip are fine.
They don't.Especially when you're a girl and girl's jeans have small pockets.

I got one, it lasted a good year but the screen died, waiting for a replacement.Easy as piss to repair if you know what torx means.

It is tho, if you're not using an SSD you're a poorfag.
As long as it's 10x the price of a HDD, it will remain a "future" technology
>4 seconds difference
Actually it's the present, are you seriously on a technology board and stuck in the past?xD
In the world of computing, even half a second makes a huge difference.
Well fuck, I guess nobody will buy them then.Why would anyone ever pay more for an objectively superior product?
I put a ssd in my wangblows laptop and the bootime went from 15 to 2 seconds
It's not even about boot times everything is just snappier and quicker in general. Boot times are faster, things load faster, read times are faster it just doesn't matter just buy that shit
Honestly I worry about ANYone who doesn't run at least one SSD these days
actually SSD are the present, there is no reason for 90% of computing on a hard disk, in servers all drives are SSDs and the same will happen to consumers as most people don't need 10TB of storage in the world of streaming media.
I don't have a SSD yet. Fucking sucks.
>never used an SSD before, always too expensive to buy on its own>scored an X220 with one for $192>totally silent>boots windows so fast the welcome animation doesn't even get time to finish>everything starts up instantlyi was blind and now i see
You aren't missing too much, as long as you are using a decent hard drive
2-in-1 laptops need them. imagine tilting a hard drive over and over while it is spinning.
>This does nothing to the drive
This.If you're running off a laptop hard drive it can make a huge difference.  But if your system is set up right, you're not gonna see much of a difference between a SSD and most 7200RPM hard drives made in the last 9 years.Yeah, GIMP starting up in 5 seconds rather than 20 is nice, but most things aren't written with freetard incompetence so there's not that big of a difference.

It's the same as any other thread on /g/. These SSD threads come up because people can't afford one, so they attack it. Linux hate threads come up because they can't understand it and hate that they're stuck with Windows because of video games.
That's a shit analogy, why the hell would someone care about another operative system if one want to play video games and use Photoshop or other countless pieces of Software Linux can't run without a virtual enviroment?For security and ricing potential?Are you that guilible to think that? Any normal person does not give a fuck about those two aspects unless you want to hide confidencial information. i.e Pizza.A better analogy would be people bashing SLI and Crossfire because they can't afford a rig with a decent multi-gpu, saying shit that it is completely pointless unless it is for using higher resolutions, ignoring the obvious performance increase just because it isn't a 1+1 increase.They expect Multi-GPU to give you double the framerate, probably possible with DX12.But your analogy?Straight up denial and retarded.

In a narrower sense, analogy is an inference or an argument from one particular to another particular, as opposed to deduction, induction, and abduction, where at least one of the premises or the conclusion is general.

Of course you should defragment it? Why would you purposely hurt your performance?
OK. Defraggler says it's 22% fragmented, Windows (8.1) defrag says 2%. Why the discrepancy?

I've done it a few times (not for malware).  They just complain that they can't do anything other than replace the HDD or machine.They have extra hardware lying around to run some diagnostics, but their entire job is to take advantage of idiots.  One guy there said "I really know what I'm doing" because I asked where the HDD enclosures were after they offered to "rescue" my data on a machine with a power problem and I refused.

>I've done it a few times (not for malware).Why?
Various hardware issues.  I've gotten cheap, shitty laptops that were bought there as gifts and were still under warranty.  I've gone in for the cheap plastic hinges coming apart, one machine wouldn't POST, and another had a screen that stopped coming on altogether when the device booted.I couldn't really isolate the problem in either of the latter two cases, and then I took it to them only to hear the same shit.  It wasn't really helpful other than getting a replacement from the warranty.
Why do you hate Unity /g/?
Unity engine or Ubuntu Unity?
I love it. I've tried 'em all and it's the best. It really is.
This. Most polished DE and once you get rid of the colour scheme, and botnet it's awesome.
I can't move the task bar.
Id say its because there is nothing to like about it, but at least it has global menus as a default (and togglable) feature. I wish more DEs had that.
both are shit
I don't hate Unity, per se. It is basically just the same to me as Win7 except the bar is stuck to the side immobile (I generally have had it at the top in Windows but whatever).What I dislike about it is how slow it is. It's dreadfully, painfully slow. It is unresponsive, causes lock ups, is jittery, has poor animations, and is all around just a bit unpleasant to use for any length of time.Having used it on two different computers for home and work I had just figured that's how it was with Linux unless I went for a lightweight WM instead. Maybe it was the graphics drivers?But no. I tried Ubuntu GNOME instead and the difference was night and day. It was smooth, fast, didn't lock up and the animations were gorgeous. Of course GNOME is a bit weird to use in comparison but it was a much nicer experience.I have no idea why it's such a hog and runs so poorly. If it didn't then I'd be much happier with it. But as it is I'll avoid using it when I can.
So, you're saying that your problem with unity is that you have a toaster
It's a nice DE, I just don't use Ubuntu.
I don't give a fuck tbh
no i don't
Unity is pretty good as a concept.HUD is best innovation on desktop in last 5 years.But Canonical.But Compiz.But not compatible with upstream - they de facto maintaining fork of whole GNOME (and Qt) stack.But 600+ MB RAM on start without doing nothing.But CPU(i5) on 25% when Alt+Tab or something.
Intel is killhttp://www.kitguru.net/components/cpu/anton-shilov/new-intel-core-i7-6700k-skylake-test-results-leak-4-8-faster-than-core-i7-4790k/
Copypastaing my post from a prior thread:Intel isn't intentionally withholding massive performance gains, this is the most infantile and uneducated myth about the semiconductor industry that there has ever been. Look at the architectural differences from Sandy Bridge to Haswell. They added a 4th ALU to their core design, along with another AGU, branch unit, and restructured FPU. The benefits to serial integer performance were paltry, FPU performance is only making large strides due to instruction support and their FPU being built as an AVX processor first and foremost.Getting appreciable gains in serial performance isn't easy nor is it cheap because there is no more low hanging fruit. The front end of intel's cores is about as perfect as you can get, and still the utilization rate of that added 4th ALU is low. Making a core even wider than that would be the epitome of diminishing returns.X86 growing from this point on in areas other than strictly parallel performance is going to require something absolutely radical. The only venues that new process nodes facilitate are lower power and higher clocks by way of lower ultimate leakage.TL;DR there are no massive serial performance gains to be had from X86 unless someone pulls a miracle out of thin air
Confirms the stagnant state of consumer processors until the 2020's.
so what you're saying is that we ARE on the very edge of x86 and have been for 5 years now?
Will FinFET do anything about x86 performance?
Sounds like the same bullshit spiel intelfags gave about Netburst.
>there are no massive serial performance gains to be had from X86 unless someone pulls a miracle out of thin air
If Zen trumps intel and intel releases a considerably stronger cpu right after, then we'll know that to be bullshit.
If I'm about to build a computer with either an i7 4790k or an i7 5820k, should I just not and wait on skylake? Will it be anywhere in that 350-450 price range?
What I'm saying is that when you mambo with Mistress Diminishing Returns it really slows down near the end.Diminishing returns isn't some novel observation found here and there, its a law.Transistor topology does nothing for the architecture itself, it only affects frequency and power characteristics. Curb your fanboyism, shit for brains. This isn't about one company vs another, its about high performance IC design slowing because Von Neumann architectures have an ultimate end point when it comes to single core performance.And this was the other half of my post:The odds of Zen actually surpasses Haswell/Broadwell in serial performance is close to zero. They'll be competitive at a lower price. AMD didn't project consumer desktops to be a growth market for them, which is a surefire sign that Zen isn't going to take the performance crown. Their current desktop CPU marketshare is 10% or less, and they're not expecting it to grow with Zen's release. Think about that.http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/399?vs=1270The Llano A8 3850 has a fixed 2.9ghz clock.The Kaveri A8 7600 has a 3.1ghz base clock and a 3.8ghz turbo.Per clock Steamroller is significantly slower than AMD's K10.5 Husky core. I point this out because by AMD's own admission Excavator is only a 5% IPC uplift over Steamroller, still well behind the K10.5 cores per clock.Zen is a 40% IPC uplift over Excavator, and that places it well ahead of K10.5, but its not going to surpass Haswell.
 Buy now. there will always be a better product 6-12 months off. Bought my 4770k in 2013 and overclocked it to 4.2 which is roughly the same as a stock 4790k.
I forgot to say, but I don't really need the computer till august of this year. I need the badass desktop when college starts back again for my junior mech engr year. I guess I'll just shoot for whatever's best when that time of year rolls around.
If someone like AMD really put the pressure on Intel, they would start doing more experiments on using other semiconductors than silicon.
>anandtechPost automatically disregarded
I really doubt Zen will surpass Intel's offerings. Just the size of Intel vs AMD is staggering, I can't imagine AMD would be able to beat Intel at R&D. But Zen doesn't really have to beat Intel's offerings either, as long as they're competitive so prices fall consumers will still win in the end.
Ok trump was the wrong choice  of words. Rather if it undercuts intel, as in a real run for its money. .then they release something substantial. Then well know its bs
Only cucks pay <$500 for a cpu
>they would start doing more experiments on using other semiconductors than silicon.The term you're looking for is substrate. The entire industry is using bulk silicon wafers, and that leaves plenty of room open for growth into SOI if need be. Absolutely mountains of work has been done when it comes to ET-SOI leveraging body biasing for a double gate effect. IBM did tons of work in developing FD-SOI based FinFETs. Heavier use of SiGe is something thats been looked at for a long time as well.In the immediate future GAA and III-V fets are what will see the light of day on FEOL. Ultimate leakage is decreasing, dynamic power characteristics are improving. Silicon based substrates have plenty of life left in them, be it bulk, SOI, or some silicon leveraging derivative.Nice shitpost.When Piledriver based Trinity first launched no one could overlook the elephant in the room which was the 3.8ghz base 4.2ghz turbo A10 5800k was flat out losing to Llano in FPU workloads. When it came to integer workloads it was barely pulling ahead despite the enormous clock disparity.A 40% uplift in IPC over Excavator is not going to be performance king. Thats all there is to it. AMD's own outlook reflects that.
correction: greater than
Will there be any point in upgrading to a Broadwell i5 over a 4690K?
Wait for AMD Zen
Broadwell is a 1-3% performance uplift over Haswell per clock. On the desktop chips the only saving grace is its Iris Pri IGP, but no one buys a $300~ CPU to use integrated graphics.
>zenso are they done with "hurr more cores"?
I already have a Z97.Then I guess it depends on how much Intel releases Broadwell for and if Haswell prices drop.
yes. They're focusing on performance per core
Parallelism isn't going to go away. Ever.Don't be an idiot.
Not quite. Zen will have the same number of cores as Bulldozer but more threads.
Well this is depressing.Anything we can look forward to in the future? Fancy architectures in development, advancements in manufacturing processes, shit like that?

Does anyone remember when Intel stopped using high quality direct contact thermal dissipation alloys in favor of synthetic materials for cost efficiency? I do. It was right after Nehalem. I fail to recall direct numbers but it significantly reduced the performance increase in crossing over to the newer generations.

As someone who has personally delidded my haswell i7 and replace the shitty tim that hardened into dust 3 months after I bought chip with liquid gallium I must say it isn't that big a deal.
Transitioning from planar structures to FinFETs improves virtually every electrostatic characteristic there is.Going behind a crude FinFET into more complex structures that further increase over all gating surface area will further drive down power. Why power consumption per transistor matters isn't just for mobile devices, but for heat output and self heating. The less leakage current when a device is switching at high frequency the more thermal headroom it should have, though this doesn't always directly contribute to max nominal clock it plays a huge role in IC design.Samsung's 14nm FinFET LPP is showing tremendous gains over their 28nm nodes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPQvgzL_DScGAA logic would put this to shame, and thats really saying something.Intel moving to a shitty TIM instead of solder didn't hurt performance, it limited max OC headroom if you were thermally constrained. Thats all.http://www.kitguru.net/gaming/uncategorized/anton-shilov/intels-devils-canyon-chips-ngptim-is-still-not-efficient-research/In short: You're an idiot
Will the skylake gpu actually be decent or should I just wait for a zen apu with hbm?
It's just a general ragepost. Op has somewhat of a point, and loyalist fanboys continue to claim intel can do no wrong. I'm no fanboy,  but I haven't had an amd chip since athlon x2 days. It angers me that someone with such a pristine reputation would go and fuck up the ihs which had been a perfectly designed model until that point when those chips already ran hot as fuck.
Those chips were house fires tho
consumer won't win in the end anon, AMD will die slowly by having less margins because they have to sell the chips for less, people will still buy intel because of marketingnobody wins except intel's profit margins
>inb4 qualcomm beats out both of them with sheer market share
fuck off shill
I hope arm servers actually aren't a hipster fad
1.) Using TIM is cheaper2.) There is less chance for the die to break during packaging 3.) There is nothing inherently wrong with using TIM under the heat spreader, the only issue was that they jewed out and chose the shittiest compound possible, and used too much of itYou'd think they'd penny that last fraction of a penny and apply as little as possible, but the minds at intel decided otherwise.A ton of AMD's chips aren't soldered fyi. AMD just does it right.So long as they're operating within their thermal envelope there isn't a problem. The only potential downside is thermally limiting your OC headroom.Remember that power in means power out. A chip may heat up due to high density, inability to transfer heat well through the die and into the heat spreader, but if its only drawing 50watts then its not exactly a space heater even if speccy reads core temp at 80c.Tech illiterate retard.
I like you. You're not a condescending asshole, and know your stuff. I just remember ocing and being able to push my i7-920 a lot more. The jewing was the thing I was trying to point out. I intend to hammer my lid off and throw some arctic silver on my 4790 some time this week, my work room gets hot as balls and even a little bit of head room is alot.Tldr well written and logistically sound post.
>jewing>arctic silvergood luck with that, faggot
I look forward to memeristors
They aren't.It's not that ARM is better than x86 in any way.It's because ARM is freely licensed to anyone with money - which allows for more engineers to go about increasing performance in different ways (and for other engineers to copy those improvements)x86 is only dying due to Intel's draconian licensing.
It's the most trusted brand, atleast for me anyway.

I don't trust this guy at all, hes the definition of a blindly zealous fanboy. Him along with mrmt, shintaidk, and a couple others are the biggest intel trolls on the site.He put together an enormous thread on Bulldozer, claiming to be measuring power consumption, and intentionally reported erroneous figures to make it look even worse than it actually was.
>ZimbabweThat's an investment and should help normalfags buy intel. >retard sees intel sticker on computer>le smart science nerd sees it >buys the machine
Normalfags already buy intel
So waiting for skylake for a new laptop is useless?  Or will the power consumption drop again?
Perf/watt will be a solid improvement, and the IGP will have better performance.
>sees ituses it*
And when will the first skylake laptops hit the market?  End of 2015?  Because longer batterylife and better igp sounds worth waiting for.

How come the green ones are so cheap compared to the rest?Is it because green is not a creative color?
because green is an awful color that nobody wants to buy.

Oh nevermind, the "on ear" version is actually an entirely different headphone and shouldn't be there.

(Even if it's USB 3.0)I'm pretty sure you're going to tell me I'm basically listening to the devil's arsehole by having a cheap microsoft usb headset without a separate mic.I'm not an audiophile but it looks like I'm not taking advantage of my onboard specs.What are some good headphone options for my board? ($200-500 or so)And if someone's into that thing, a moderately decent desktop microphone.
Would that be driven by the Magni2U?The SRS 3170 comes with the amp to drive the cans (SR 307).
oh and to not offend the pastebin.For at home computer listening, so I don't need anything portable or small.Tonal - if I'm spending money it better be useful for gaming, like improved ability to hear footsteps and light sounds compared to the crap I wear now.I'm in United States.
HE-400i are the best headphones you can get for $500.The snowball desktop mic is commonly recommended, but I don't really know anything about it, so you'll have to look into it yourself.Yes, I can drive my LCD-2 with my FiiO E10.Magni2U has got more than enough power.
What chapter is that from? I don't remember it
Anyone familiar with these?http://www.jaybirdsport.com/bluebuds-x-bluetooth-headphones/Reviews look ok. Looking for Bluetooth headphones for the gym and running. Budget isn’t a huge concern, mainly the portability and comfort.
LCD-2 weren't as hard to power as Head-Fi often claims, and the new Fazor versions are quite sensitive.Don't think the Audeze strap is for sale yet.Staxen usually aren't tuned to be warm. But, if you notch out with EQ a little around 1-2kHz and 9-10kHz, you'll find they lack a fair amount of brightness. It'll come off as clearer, vs the 598.That board isn't going to be very "audiophile" and manufacturers fudge their performance numbers by no small margin.
hmm, looks like those aren't sold here in texas even at Fry's electronics, I don't think I'll risk $500 without an idea how it'll sound or fit.
and your evidence that the board you have never used sounds bad comes from where?The gut feeling of a hipster means that it's impossible for good hardware to make it onto a motherboard.
well you aren't going to find very many worthwhile headphones in that price range at local stores unless you live in a big city
So my 4 year old audio technica ATH-A700's died recently.The drivers sound all fucked up and i'm not really sure what's wrong with them. Should i take them apart and find out? or just i just trash them and get something similar? what's the update to the a700's
Trash them and get something with bass.Right now you're missing out if you have a varied music taste.
I don't want HURRRRBASSS in my headphones. I want that for my speakers.And i generally don't listen to overtly/obnoxious songs with niggerbass in them.
the ad700 just straight up lacks bass
>I don't want HURRRRBASSS in my headphones.That seems to be what you got right now.
oops shit you have the a700
A700 NOT AD700 you mongoloids.They have a different sound signature. That's why i originally went with the A700's because i prefer closed and they have more bass (not by much though, perfect amount for me) than the infamous lack of bass on the AD700

Texas has audio shops floating around, depending on how close you live to the big cities. Big box electronics aren't likely to carry the more high-end headphones.>sound badI guess I implied that. Modern boards usually don't sound bad, hopefully. Low impedance and low sensitivity are the worst case scenario for amplifiers, and quite audibly so in some cases. Many planar magnetics fall straight into hat category.Mobos are terrible environment for low noise and sensitive electronics. Mobo manufacturers like quoting the spec of the chip in its ideal manufacturer suggested implementation, and not the actual measured performance of the board.Says nothing about the output impedance, or current supply, or THD+N with actual signals, and so on. You can fix most of that by unloading the output with an actual amplifier.I don't have many good examples to show, but with some measurements posted at Anandtech, they fall short when tested into actual products. Look here for the mobo:http://www.anandtech.com/show/7709/retesting-the-asus-rampage-iv-black-edition-audioThe testing procedure is the analog out to the line-in, which is pretty close to an idealized load. The problem is that lower impedance loads (as in actual headphones) stress the electronics circuitry more to keep up current demands.
How is the LCD2 compare to the HD 598 comfort wise?I live in a tech dessert in Canada so can't just stroll to a botique shop and try them on.
this might be the weirdest comparison I've ever heard
Don't see how comparing how comfortable x is to y but sure bro.

BASED GORHILL
Dynamic url filtering is cool stuff. I always hated how you had to allow all scripts or deny all scripts and there wasn't a third option to allow just the ones you want. At least not without using static filters.
this
While Chris is busy creating new sites to ask for donations to his bank account in name of the "official uBlock team TM", gorhill, the actual developer behind it all, is adding useful features that Chris would never be able to create: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-URL-filtering
nope, it unfortunately still doesn't tell you what list a filter came from, so debugging is a hell and you gotta open your raw lists one by one
https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/58If there's any developer reading this, please consider working on this issue to help gorhill and all o fus.
Why are you still using uBlock? Adblock is better>ublock autists will defend this
>Adblock is betternope
So I'm giving ublock origin a try and I do quite like it, so by default it's just an adblock, then if you tick the advanced user option it turns into a noscript / request policy thing too. Though I'm a little unclear about that, so with that box ticked, is there an option to block everything globally? for now I've just set the global rule in the first column to block everything, if that's blocking all cross site requests and scripts on the page, then this is doing the job of noscript and request policy in one, if that's the case then what's the point of this umatrix that I keep hearing people shill? At the moment I'm pretty happy with just using ABE, noscript and request policy as I have a clear idea of what each does, though with ublock I'm a little unclear about what exactly it's doing and how safe I'd be on a domain with some dodgy scripts running.
What does dynamic url filtering do?>tfw we amo now
https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-URL-filtering
Should I bother redoing my old filters from scratch?
So, basically now i can block specific scripts, even inline ones, from a specific sites even without blocking all of them?
You can block selectively everything that shows in the logger.
Fuck yeah.I was waiting for eons for this.Now there's literally no reason to use adblock
>ublock>it actually doesn't block anything
Can TomsGuide be beat?https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Tips-and-tricks-waterfall#why-using-a-blocker-is-very-important
this is pure cancer
What the fuck?I have seen shady streaming websites with less bullshit than that.
How do you get that widened panel that shows all the blocked domains?
You check the I am an advanced user and you get it to behave like request policy.
Interesting choice of article
his chrome store screenshot is lulzy too
That's because it was spammed a good amount of times on /g/ a while back.You know, when people accuse you of stealing but all you want is not being tracked you want to check the source.Like, one time i stumbled upon an article talking about a catholic relic and there were all sorts of amazing things happening when they analyzed it.Then i read the universities who conduced the study and they had names like:holy university of jesus christ and the virgin mary and the saints and we suck the pope's dick
I don't trust ublock enough to disable noscript and request policy too. I'm just going to use it as an adblock for now, also what are the best 3rd party filters to use with it?
ublock still doesn't block popups on porn sites, adblock at least mostly did it.How long until they add it?
Block spam, social buttons tracks you so disable those.Third party for china and russia helps too
Well this is what I've got so far.
Throw in malvertizing by disconnectEasylist it's one of the defaults in adblockers in general so that's a good one.spam404 is niceAs said before add in china and russia, plus whatever country are you from
>not using umatrix+ublock
Tell that nigger gorhill to add SeaMonkey support for his fork of uBlock and uMatrix and I'll switch. If Alex could add it to the official uBlock, it shouldn't be hard.
mother of god. This image could convince most people to use an ad blocker. seriously, fuck anyone who uses all these shitty scripts that do not help me at all. They deserve to lose ad revenue.
>using memebrowser
Can I ask, if you're using umatrix do with ublock do you enable the I am an advanced user in ublock or do you leave it disabled as umatrix makes it redundant?
how do they generate money with those invisible ads?
Can anyone tell me the bare minimum filters I need to block everything? I am just looking to reduce my memory usage as much as possible.
1x1 white pixel ads maybe, no idea.Notice all that stuff disappearing on the bottom of the author's name, those are all ads or tracking shit one way or another.Popups left and right.
by tracking you and selling your info.
You should use ublock only for the static filters. Also disable the domain filters in ublock and enable the in umatrix. You can use ublock now for the url filtering if you want to block some obscure shit.
Stock everything, the filter from your country and i suggest the social list.More filters doesn't really impact too much on RAM to be honest
not everything is about selling products, for example in android and in browsers, there are a lot of "spyware" (invisible ads, or scripts) that tracks your information and then it is sold for money to other companies.
>Can anyone tell me the bare minimum filters I need to block everything? I am just looking to reduce my memory usage as much as possible.It's not about filters as much as it is about mastering dynamic filtering:https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-quick-guideYou should read whole uBlock wiki to get idea how to protect yourself while browsing web.

Daily reminder not to trust Adblock Plus shills. The only reason why uBlock doesnt block ads and just hides them is that this way the websites' owners still get paid for the ads. If you dont use uBlock you are literally murdering people who die from starvation

Is this actually what ublock does? If that's the case I'll switch back to ABE.

But muh screen tearing.
valid :\
the 290x is the same performance as a 970 for the same money, why not buy it?
I've read it needs a 700W PSU.I don't want to spend that much for a modular PSU.

Why did Linux outpace HURD?Was it something inherent about the design of the kernel, or just that Linux got better developers or better project management from Linus?
Linus rushed out his Kernel to beat the GNU Hurd and stole all the momentumShit like this is why patents exist, Free Software is a double edged sword
Nobody liked the Microkernel concept.
>HURDMore like TURD am I rite?
GNU Hurd wouldn't have reached the popularity of Linux today even if Linux didn't exist. If it wasn't rushed out, it still would have overtaken Hurd in popularity and user-base.Hurd was and always will be an educational project, nothing more. Its design precipitates this. Say what you will about it, micro kernels just don't work in the environments monolithic kernels currently dominate.
Linux was able to reach a workable state first.HURD is workable now but apparently back then debugging it was a fucking nightmare.
At the time, early 90s, HURD was too slow due to its microkernel design over Linux's monolithic kernel. It also took longer to design and develop it. Linux had a design they wanted to copy whereas Hurd was looking for a new way to do similar things, this took time and lots of trial and error to get right. In fact they still haven't got it right.
S6 vs Note 4Anyone here used both? Any reason to prefer one to another?
Note is clearly the superior device, with additional features and a price to reflect it.
I don't see any other additional features aside from gestures and the pen. What else is there?
Reasons for S6>its sexy>its fast>camera is good>1440p screen>less bloatReasons for note 4>better battery>larger screen (1080p)>will most likely survive more drops than the s6>s-pen
Note 4 is 1440p.
This and SD card support.
You forgot, for Note 4>replaceable battery, so your phone doesn't turn into a giant piece of shit after 1.5 years>microSD card
And removable battery, with a fingerprint reader. Granted the s6 reader is better, but the note 4 reader works just fine. The only concern I have with my note 4 is that it isnt as waterproof as the s5 was.
really? you can change battery yourself on Note?
Yes, very easily.
Thanks. Going with Note.
Good choice. I have a Note 4 myself and I fucking love it. Put CM12.1 on there, thing just screams. S6 is a giant piece of shit for many reasons, before the Galaxy phones were actually pretty nice because they were some of the only flagships left with SD slots and removable batteries, but with the S6 it's like Samsung was all "you know those iphones that are popular with the kids these days? Let's just make one of those"
It fucks your mom in the ass. What do you mean just gestures and pen? What more do you want? You're stupid for putting CM on it and not something that supports S-Pen action view/features and should probably kill yourself for being so dumb.

You can't run Active Directory or Microsoft Exchange from Linux. You are forced to have Windows servers in an enterprise environment.But that's okay, I wouldn't expect the idiots on /g/ to know anything about actually administrating an enterprise environment.

>Most people I work with use Windows because they feel it's easier and more convenient then using Linux.No, most people use Windows because it comes pre-installed on their home computers and because of the anti-competitive stuff Microsoft pulled off in the 90s which basically gave them a monopoly on workstations is what they are familiar with and will always be familiar with.
>unironically using Oracle LDAPLast I used it in 2012 the interface was a total mess and it took forever for a new option to load (e.g. switching from users to computer objects). I was only making a six computer network as part of some training, but I wanted to pull my hair out before I was done.
When I first started using Linux I thought everyone else that worked in IT and didn't use a Unix based OS was a pleb, then I realzed that some people arn't hobbiests and just want to get their job done.Working in Windows wont impede 99% of work related tasks you'll ever do, and Linux won't benefit you either.
I had 1 BSOD in windows 8.1 but it was my fault because i force closed daemon tools while i was installing from a image that was mounted using daemontools
>Adopt a "stable" release schedule that forces most real-world users onto years old kernels, don't mention security in changelogs>and then complain when others attempt to manage the disaster you helped create, despite their efforts not affecting you adversely in any way
Using an inferior grandfathered in OS serves absolutely no purpose.
Nice try fuckoI don't even use the Contacts program
Why the fuck were you using Daemon Tools to mount in 8.1? It has native mounting FFS
He's right, though. If you want security updates, fucking use a LTS kernel, not a special snowflake old unsupported version.
>You can't run Active Directory or Microsoft Exchange from Linux. You are forced to have Windows servers in an enterprise environment.There is nothing to say that must use AD or (good lord) Exchange.There's also nothing to say you can't run AD or Exchange on a handful of Windows servers and then use Linux or some other OS on everything else.
1) You don't need Active Directory or Exchange to have an enterprise set up2) Are you seriously implying that there are no AD compliant implementations for Linux? Top fucking kekJust because they aren't free as in freedom, doesn't mean they don't exist?>inb4 there is no reason to use free software at all unless you go all out
>Working in an environment where all of my co-workers have IT related B.Sc's >Not competent enough to switch to Linuxstop b8ing me.
where's the comparison list of segfaults for windows?did you even make a comparison?wait, this is bait, isn't it?
Nothing says that you have to, but the people making the tech decisions are too easily sunk in to going all the way with Microsoft's services and don't consider other alternatives.>You're going to be using Windows clients because of course you are>Since you're using Windows clients, How about Microsoft Active Directory? It is guaranteed to work with all versions of Windows you have on your network!>Oh, and since you're also using Windows, how about Microsoft Office?>Now that you have Microsoft Office, why not toss in Microsoft Exchange so people can sync their emails across multiple computers? (Important people love their emails for some reason)>Oh you have a Microsoft Exchange server? Well, why not use Microsoft Lync too?Also, I'm not sure if Linux implementations of LDAP (or NIS+ if that's your thing) can push group policy changes. That's kind of an important thing when you have a fuck ton of clients.
>I'm not sure if Linux implementations of LDAP (or NIS+ if that's your thing) can push group policy changes.This is true, not even Samba4 in full AD mode can push policy updates. Although Microsoft are moving toward stuff like DSC instead so that may not be much of an issue soon.I've actually deployed AD for AAA in a Linux environment; a couple thousand Linux servers (running OpenStack) authenticating against AD (with PAM ldapd). Worked well.
>You are forced to have Windows servers in an enterprise environment.Ah, the ego of a low-level tech guy who recently graduated from the helpdesk to the server team.  Smell that shit from a mile away, because I too took that path. . . .You're wrong, son.  Now go back to WoW and stop bugging the grown-ups.
$ dmesg | grep -i segfault hmm... nothing here
That's good to hear. Perhaps some day in the (near?) future we can get rid of our Windows servers.Explain to me then how you will change all your computers to sleep in thirty minutes instead of sixty for the 500 computers on your floor without the use of AD. Microsoft is the king of anti-competition.

Hello /g/. I'm buying a new phone very soon, but I don't know what phone should I buy. That is why I am asking suggestions from you. I'm searching for mostly Android phones but you can suggest anything.
Are you into anime and open source? Get androidDo you care about social interaction? Get iPhoneDon't you care about anime nor social interaction? Windows Phone.You're welcome
just ask in any other of the 20 phone threads>/g/android>/g/phone
>green bubbles
You are statistically wrong, sir, as most smartphone-driven social interactions are from Android to Android.
that's only because poor people make up the majority on earth.
If you don't need LTE, maybe get a Redmi 2 2GB or a P3000 3GB or such.
Android's user base is across all demographics.IOS's user base is poorfags who actually get some social status boost for being "able" to afford a $500-1000 phone.
Yeah I know I was just trying to be some obnoxious shitposter.I do like to add  that iPhones are most popular among lower-middle class. Actual poor people can't afford them and higher class people don't care about status symbols that much.Also the real difference is the distribution between sexes, doesn't the majority of women have iPhones an majority of men have Android?
>  Actual poor people can't afford themI've seen enough people on social welfare who had an iPhone. Of course they can afford them, they just spend their disposable income of multiple months. And fucking brand shoes.'course that's a western poorfag. I'd expect some poor asian actually can't.> doesn't the majority of women have iPhones an majority of men have Android?Maybe in the USA... IDK. Not in Europe.
In my part of Europe, which is western-Europe probably except for the fedora nation known as Germany, the majority of women between 15 and 30 have an iPhone.
Android phones are battery drain demonsIphones are overpriced shit with mediocre specsWindows phone are for old people and social outcasts.Choose your drug
> the majority of women between 15 and 30 have an iPhone.That's hard to believe, I recall Android had a ~75% market share in Europe at the end of 2014.( Found it: https://bgr.com/2014/07/01/android-market-share-2014/ )Maybe some iPhone model is the most used individual phone amongst women, but that means almost nothing.
I thought in NL-GB-BELG-FR Android is at 60-65% but that's over the entire population, how hard is it to believe the 35% of the population that uses Apple are mainly women between 15 and 30?
> Android phones are battery drain demonsYou can easily get 8-12 hours of web browser use, 12+ hours of talk time, and two-four weeks on standby, without even going to oversized or external batteries or expensive >$200 models.Shouldn't really be a big problem, anon.
Opinions on Xperia Z3 Compact?
look at the MaH of these batteries.If you were to put WP/iOS on the same hardware as android you'll see how terribly optimized Android is.
/g/odtier.
>  NL-GB-BELG-FRThat's a very odd choice.> how hard is it to believe the 35% of the population that uses Apple are mainly women between 15 and 30?Very hard to believe. It'd mean Apple's broad marketing reached almost only women. Besides it's incredibly narrow in the context of such demographics.> look at the MaH of these batteries.~2-3.5 Ah for the most part, about the same as for the IOS and Windows models.Mine has 2Ah.
HTC One M8
>odd choiceYou mean western-European countries minus Germany? And please /g/ is not the reality, if I were to take a look at my group converences in whatsapp and look at the percentage of women using iOS vs Android you'll see it's nearly double the percentage of men using iOS.
>~2-3.5 Ah for the most part, about the same as for the IOS and Windows models.Typical Android denial.Look at most WP flagships, the Lumia 930 for example has a 2400mAh battery compared to the 3000mAh LG G3. The OpO has 3100mAh.Now the 930 is a terrible example since it performs quite poorly, but take a look at the Lumia 640, a mid range budget phone that blows botht he G3 and OpO out of the water in with only 2500mAh.
I'm in the same boat, OP. I've had a Nexus 5 for over a year now and while it's been mostly fine, I'm ready for a new phone. I'm actually looking to go back to iOS because the N5's battery life has broken me.
>  NL-GB-BELG-FR> You mean western-European countries minus Germany? Are you serious now?
I can vouch for this. Fast as fuck phone with Sense on, runs quicker than my gf's iphone6/
Well, any phone can drain your battery quickly if you use it continuously while it charges.
FYI if a European refers to western-Europe he usually means France, Germany, Britain and Netherlands. Spain etc. is considered Southern-Europe and Scandinavia is northern-Europe.
> Lumia 640> G3 and OpOThat's a bit like comparing a desktop machine to a gaming PC, isn't it?
No it's more like comparing actual phones vs phablets. Outside of watching anime and playing gaymes where the fuck do you need that power for?
I'm also European and with Western Europe, I mean exactly the usual definition.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe
then how do you refer to Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece? Or to Scandinavia?That map of yours would even include Croatia as a western-European country, would you agree if a Croat says he is western-European?
I don't care about benchmarks. What phone does /g/ have and what is the real-world battery use like? How long is your workday? How long are you away from a charger? How long does your phone last before it's nearly dead?
Moto /g/It used to be 2 days, now it's merely 12 hours.
that's how far Android is willing to go just to show he's right.
i don't get that map. i suppose members of former yugoslavia listed as western european due to not having to participate in the comecon and overall having relative sovereignty compared to other countries in the eastern bloc. But then how are baltic states listed as western european, when they were literally part of the USSR with a less sovereignty than a lot of countries not included?By what aspect does that map categorize a country western european?
I rarely see people using iPhones, and if anything, it's mostly the 3 or 4. Not really surprising given that a brand new iPhone 6 costs around 1.5x the average monthly salary. Also, most of those older iPhones are brought here from abroad by emigrants, homeland Apple market is really small here.Samshit B2710. I charge it every three days or so. Didn't really test how long the battery holds, I guess it probably could handle 96 hours.
that's a reply to this comment btwi just edited my comment the 4chan way
ye lol that map even includes Serbia as western-European.Fucking Serbia.And where is that?
> comparing actual phones vs phabletsYea, the flagships have a bigger / higher res screen, too. Not just more processing power. Both of these do cost battery life, yes. Maybe a comparison with midrange phones is better...?See pic related, this looks almost the same on Android, and that's without the tester bothering to make sure no extraneous software is running.> Outside of watching animeAnon, midrange androids handle this just fine. Some would even play h.265 already, despite almost no one encoding h.265 yet.It's for playing games and converting music / videos on your phone and stuff like that.
>  But then how are baltic states listed as western european, when they were literally part of the USSR with a less sovereignty than a lot of countries not included?Good point, this map also is pretty shit - the WP one is better.
(cont'd)Pic.Either way, Western Europe is bigger.
that's still not western-Europe.This is what the UN world heritage describes as western-Europe
>baltic states>balkan states>westernTopkek
...what's the relation between anime and android?
Okay, you're using some UN geoscheme then. I admit that's not too odd, though not something I'd have thought of.I was using "Western Europe" as in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_EuropeEven then, it's odd not to have Germany but some other minors instead (and not all minors).Besides, all this discussion about a small subregion of Europe when we started from "Europe" in And even with all that there's still no indication that it's almost all young women that make up the European / Western European (by either defintion) IOS user base.

I'm currently reading C Primer Plus (2013) to learn C. Is this a good book, also, what other books should I read?
Im a scrub . Im using php w/codeigniter
This is a fantastic book, finished it a few weeks ago. I didn't really know what to read after it either, but I do suggest sticking to that book and dedicating time to it, it's really worth it. Depending on your interests, you can pick up Hacker's Delight, which is all about bit-level hacking and tricks, or if you get into data structures (by the end of the book, I loved it, even though the binary search tree was a little tough to grasp the small parts of), C Interfaces and Implementations is another book. There are plenty of books, and many, many of them are specifically for C, just look up what you want to learn AFTER you read C Primer Plus and have at it.Oh, and by the way, if you want to learn C++ after, don't read C++ Primer by Lippman, it's not good. Perhaps Bjarney's book, I've been reading it but it's a reference manual more than anything, no exercises and the like, but it's good. Trying to wrap my head around all the shit regarding classes now. Eugh.
I'm beginning to go through SICP, unsure why my university doesn't prescribe this as reading for all CS students.That said, I'm learning C++. I'm at the point where I'm beginning to delve into the standard library more and I understand most of the language's concepts well; it's just that I'm struggling to find a project or come up with an idea for a project that C++ would be good for. If any of you could give me some ideas, that would be heavily appreciated!
If you want to read a C++ book, the best one is Absolute C++ by Walter Savitch, it explains things in the clearest way possible and provides challenging exercises. It has 5 star reviews across the board, so you can't go wrong
>wat r u working on, anonchan?being a disgusting tranny

It refreshes, but it doesn't display the new rows in the table.
physics simulation of some sort:D
Books? IDK. But if you want to use C effectively you are going to have to learn some data structures. There are three types of C data structures that are discussed mainly:ListsTreesMapsSingle and double linked lists are fairly simple to understand and hash maps are simple to understand as long as you don't attempt to understand the hashing function themselves. Hash maps are a bit harder to implement than lists, especially growing. The real trouble is with trees. There is the standard unbalanced binary trees which are simple to understand and implement, but self-balancing binary trees are tricky to both understand and implement. There are two relevant implementations of self-balancing binary trees used today: red-black trees and AVL trees. Spend plenty of time on them understanding how the algorithms that balance the trees work and why the algorithm guarantees balance. Honestly I learned everything I just talked about from Wikipedia and Eternally Confuzzled.Next you are going to want to learn how to use language additions from the recent c99 and c11 standards. It's very likely the book will only teach you to the c89 standard. This means using things like 'inline' and 'restrict', c99 types, threads, and generics. The rest of it might be useful to you someday, you don't need it however.Also get K&R if just for the last chapter on the Unix system interface. it explains a lot, including how malloc, file descriptors, and the stdio buffer work.

Just apply differentation/integration rules until done. I'm pretty sure it is O(n) for both.
depends on what you're deriving/integrating. if it's a polynomial it's really simple
i'm i'm pretty sure the field gravitates towards one point, so it'll be shaped kinda like a valley. you can skip ahead but you will still need to compare two adjacent points to determine the slope. like for a binary search you could check 50 and 51, and if 51 is lower than 50 you check 75 and 76, and if 76 is higher than 75 you check 62 and 63 and so on
I'm trying to search a binary heap for a certain node.  I'm having trouble finding a way to search the heap in better than O(n).My first guess was to start at the bottom and break when the next item's score was lower than the one I'm searching for (the heuristic never underestimates the score of the node).  But pic related (assuming red line is score of item) this turns out to be much worse than O(N).How would /g/ perform this search?
I don't think there is a way to search a binary heap in better than O(n) time.

Sweet!
You need a binary search tree not a heap
What the fuck. A fucking dance domain. Like seriously. What. The. Fuck.I like it though that there are a shitton of cool new domains. By adding that many domains it basically removes the domain ending part.
This just hit me...Search bottom up, only search from childless nodes (ie nodes from end of list to but not including parent of last node) and only traverse the tree on left children.This results in 1, break, 2, 5, break, 3, break, 4, 6 break.If my thinking is right it's O(1) and O(n) bounded. Scoring much better than O(n) in cases where the red line is lower in the tree even when item is not found.No, I need a heap.  Root should always be the lowest value for O(1) lookup.
Can't you use something like a red-black tree and store the lowest value in a separate variable?
You might be able to but every time I look up the lowest value I remove it from the heap.  So then I'd have to search the tree to find the lowest value again.  You'd save time lookup but take a hit finding the lowest value every time you remove it (in this case a lot).
Shouldn't you be using a priority queue then? There are specialized heaps for that kind of stuff.
I'm pretty happy they're doing that, it makes domain squatting less of a problemthough .com has become the defacto "if it doesn't have it, it's tacky"
>google-analytics.com
This is in C so I don't have the C++ priority queue class.  At any rate pq is an abstraction of a heap.  I'm implementing a pq using a binary heap.  Maybe there's a library somewhere that already does this but I'm doing this out of an interest in learning heaps, tree, etc.
Look up how the C++ priority queue is implemented then.
rip ;_;7
There... doesn't seem to be a method for searching a PQ in C++... How dumb.

Hey guys, check out my character histogram chart. Any way to make it better?#include <stdio.h>#define ASCII_CHAR_LIMIT 255int main(void) {      int nChars[ASCII_CHAR_LIMIT];      int i, j, c;            for (i = 0; i < ASCII_CHAR_LIMIT; i++) {            nChars[i] = 0;      }            while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {            nChars[c]++;      }            printf("Character Historgram\n");            for (i = 0; i < ASCII_CHAR_LIMIT; i++) {            if (nChars[i] == 0) {                  ;            }            else {                  switch (i) {                        case '\b':                              printf("bks ");                              break;                        case '\t':                              printf("tab ");                              break;                        case ' ' :                              printf("spc ");                              break;                        case '\n':                              printf("nln ");                              break;                        default:                              printf("%c ", i);                              break;                  }                  for (j = 0; j < nChars[i]; j++) {                        printf("%c", 254);                  }                  printf("\n");            }      }  }
ASCII_CHAR_LIMIT 255ASCII actually only goes from 0-127. I suppose 255 lets you deal with UTF-8 input, but your results will be weird.      for (i = 0; i < ASCII_CHAR_LIMIT; i++) {            nChars[i] = 0;      }can be replaced byint nChars[ASCII_CHAR_LIMIT] = {0};for (i = 0; i < ASCII_CHAR_LIMIT; i++) {It's 2015. You can do for (int i = 0; i < ASCII_CHAR_LIMIT; i++) {Your code could use a little restructuring to get rid of indentation, but that's a very nit-picky issue.
Well, I for one would love to usefor (i = 0; i < ASCII_CHAR_LIMIT; i++) {However I am using gcc and in order for me to do so I have to use the c99 flag, which does not let me do much more that the current standard.I used 255 so that I could use extended ASCII and that I am in a current locale other than english that has extended ASCII.Thanks for the tip on:int nChars[ASCII_CHAR_LIMIT] = {0};
GCC 5.1 defaults to c11 now.There is no real reason to use the old standard.
I'll ask here rather than making a new thread.Recently graduated with a degree in physics and amazingly there was very little programming involved so my skills are seriously lacking. Which language(s) are generally considered a must? Should I start with C and then C++ or something?It probably depends on what I want to do with my life, and right now I'm not 100% sure. I'm leaning towards audio programming, VST, game audio etc.
I must have an outdated version then.
GCC 5.1 is pretty new.Most distros are still on 4.9 or older.gcc --version to find out.
Start off with either Python, C, or Lisp. You are the kind of guy who can pick and choose either of these.Read Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw, The C Programming Language by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, or read Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Gerald Sussman.That, or, if you're ballsy enough, try The Art of Computer Programming by Knuth.
Oh damn, son. I'm on 4.8.1!Thanks again.
I learned how to use regex's by using sed in a script on my router to download and modify ad-blocking hosts files.
Uh oh man.MinGW doesn't have 5.1 on its repository yet.What should I do?
Roll
Just add the std=gnu11 to your makefile or whatever.GCC 5 had some interesting changes, but nothing to go out of your way for.

A statistically random one, mostly as a benchmark to build a fast framework for making actually interesting low-order virtual brain-like networks.  It has 100,000 nodes/neurons each with exactly 100 connections/synapses, with 1000 of the nodes being inputs randomized ever few ticks.  Not very realistic, but then again it's just a benchmark.

You reached the limit of Intel's jewdaism
we are not even close buddy
It's because of AMD being literally cancer in the CPU market,they are not releasing anyting that can compete against Intel,why improve then?
no, intel just doesn't give a fuck about increasing raw performance when they don't need to. cost per transistor and energy cost per FLOPS is more important
Skylake only 5% faster than HaswellMore like 8%,still though I was excited for Skylake...and no I'm not.
Who here will ride their 2500k/2600k till 2020? I know I will.

Official Intel® documents. Trust me, goy.
In 2016 Intel is going to get absolutely destroyed by AMD with Zen if this is true.
They haven't increased with more than  5% since Wendy Bridge, and for over lockers with wasn't until Devil's Canyon that performance was any higher than what they already had if the nought a 2500k or 2600K since they could easily be OCd to 5 GHz or even higher sometimes.
Anyone else still see no need to upgrade from their i5-2500k?
>In 2016 Intel is going to get absolutely destroyed by AMD with Zen if this is true.Looks like what you are saying checks out:http://wccftech.com/amd-zen-featured-summit-ridge-family-14nm-processors-rumored-feature-fm3-socket-support-ddr4-memory-compatiblity/>16 cores,much stronger and efficienter than FX-8350>95 watt TDPMUHHHHHH DIIIIICCCCCCKKKKK

i don't think you know what cancer means.
>intel shills trying to bullshit about skylake being the next core 2>5% ipc AGAINyou silly goyim got screwed again, year of the zen will be so much more satisfying
Maybe TDP will be a shitton lower since it's baked on 14nm?
Wait for Zen™
in other words completely useless for any sort of enthusiast setup
I plan on doing that with my 3570k, fuck upgrading anymore, only the GPU and that will end pretty quicky
This.Feels pretty good, actually.It's getting to the point where I'll need to upgrade for things like PCI Express and storage bandwidth before I'll need to do it for my CPU.
>Intel desperately trying to gain foothold in the mobile space>can't because their chips aren't quite good enoughHurp, dat Intel must be leaving tons of performance on the table because there's just no competition!
Intel has been nothing but dissapointment since 2500k,fuck this.
>goyim will defend this.
Skylake only 5% faster than HaswellBut that would make it slower than Broadwell.
>implying broadlel is faster than haslel

>no OC numbers>one nonsensical benchmark that doesn't show the big pictureAbsolutely useless thread link OP
What kind of a fucking retard want to upgrade from Haswell to Skylake anyway? You must be stupid to upgrade after 1 generation. At least wait for Canonlake if you are using Haswell.

It's no surprise if the competition only adds more cores to stupid designs.
>MUH 14NMI was holding faith unto this......sigh.
I'm not saying I'm sympathetic toward intel but you guys with the 2500k should realize that my i73615QM is equal to your 2500k in every way at a lower clock speed on my laptop. Mobile is where the improvements are happening.
As if anyone who cares about the desktop gives a shit about mobile crap.
Two generations, mate. The fact that Broadwell's release got fucked doesn't change that.
>Mobile is where the improvements are happening.Probably because Intel are terrible in this department
I completely forgot about Broadwell's existence.
well i care, i only use laptops. I wish there was a powerful AMD cpu that could give me the same battery life. I would switch.
maybe people really want to use DDR4 RAM.
Honestly I couldn't tell the differences between using DDR3 and DDR4.
Leldozer was close to sandy bridge and that was a piece of shit
>maybe people really want to use DDR4 RAM.Won't change much,apart from the amount of money in your wallet.
I don't think Intel gains anything from really high-speed RAM. At least now.Hey, I bet some people are already jumping on a hype train. I know my friend is waiting out his upgrade, just to get Skylake with DDR4 and new generation of GPU.
TDP actually matters in mobile.
>I know my friend is waiting out his upgrade, just to get Skylake with DDR4 and new generation of GPU.nothing wrong with that
Can they really make new die shrinks under 10 (or 7) nm with sillicon? I think it's physically impossible.
I agree, but he's way too hyped for DDR4.
You shouldn't.DDR4 is most likely a bit slower then DDR3 right now.DDR3 was slower then DDR2 on release.
>I agree, but he's way too hyped for DDR4.Why would anyone be hyped for DDR4?
I don't know. But he refused to get anything, but DDR4 mobo, he even though about buying Haswell-E, just to get DDR4 support.I bet it's a new shiny and he's interested in it. DDR4 will be a good choice in a long run, I remember buying DDR2 sticks when DDR3 became mainstream, shit was expensive.
I am in this situation.Have my good ol' 2500k at 4.5 and was waiting for a tangible performance increase (new features of a modern chipset)Seems like I'll wait another year. Spending 500 € for a 15 % CPU performance increase is not worth it for me.
If you compare massively overclocked DDR3 to stock DDR4.
Of course they can, theoretically they could go as low as one silicon atom, which is somewhere near 0.1nm. But keep in mind that these specifications are more a rule of thumb, one transistor isnt REALLY 7/10/14/16 nm. Unfortunately research cost are rising faster than the actual performance gain, so we might hit a barrier in the near future.
I've read somewhere that at around 5nm, some quantum effects begin to jump in and fuck shits up.
Im happy that there are people like him, we need the early adopters, someone has to start buying new stuff, besides DDR4 isnt even too expensive.
>Did we reach the limits of what CPUs can do?no intel are just massive jewbag scum that milk obsolete arch for all its worth because they have had a defacto monopoly for the last several yearswhen Zen releases Intel will immediately release a new chip with a 6-7ghz clock
>6-7ghz clockCan't wait for the 500W INTEL HOUSEFIRE
Seeing this shit, I wish Carrizo came to the desktop... looks marvelous in laptops. Can't wait for Zen.
Intel doesn't really care about desktop. They're more or less interested in Servers and they're especially interested in mobile segment, they're losing money on mobile chips, but continue to pour more money into them.
Thats terrible did they at least get power consumption down by 30-40%? Cause that would make it okay I guess.
http://browser.primatelabs.com/geekbench3/compare/2628863?baseline=2614473Carrizo already kicking ass, just wait for Zen.
>tfw i5-2500k at 4.7 GHz with a Hyper 212 Evo that only costs 30 bucksWhy would anyone upgrade from this?
Intel is probably hitting the limits of what their PIII based architectures can do. That's not the same thing as reaching the hard limits on CPU power, it just means that for dramatic gains intel would have to try something new instead of rehashing the same old thing a million times.
did they at least get power consumption down by 30-40%? Not for desktops,small chance they did for mobile.
>Why would anyone upgrade from this?What else am I going to do with all that fucking money I saved?
144Hz IPS monitor(s) 2 390X or 980TiOne of those new Intel PCIe SSDscustom waterloop
Purchase a few SSDs to put in RAID. That'll make a bigger difference than in real-life usage than a newer CPU.
>fucking up latencyno thanks
>One of those new Intel PCIe SSDsThis. Assuming your motherboard supports it, an Intel 750 SSD as your boot drive would be neat.
>Intel 750 SSD>2200mb/s read speedIs Samshit even trying?
"Samshit"'s M.2 SSD has similar speeds in a much smaller form factor.
>comparing PCIe to SATAAre you even trying?
I'm not sure if half the read speed qualifies as similar, not that you'd ever notice a difference during normal use.
>smaller form factor>both are M.2 form factorseriously?
Nigger, please.https://www.techpowerup.com/211750/samsung-now-producing-industrys-first-m-2-nvme-pcie-ssd-for-the-pc-market.html>The new NVMe-based SM951 SSD achieves sequential data read and write performance up to 2,260 megabytes per second (MB/s) and 1,600 MB/s, respectively>When it comes to random read operations, the SM951-NVMe can process 300,000 IOPS
The SM951 has better read speeds than the 750. The 750 stomps it in writes and latency, though.>both are M.2 form factorNo they're not.
Ah, I was looking at the older model
>AHCI vs NVMe >AHCI loses in latency and random loadDURR no shit
>my mobo doesn't have M2 slotFuck.
5% on 5% year after yearyour 2500k is 30% slower than the equivalent chip today
samsung has shit latency across their SSD modelsit's funny
>AHCI loses in latency and random loadThe SM951 wins in random reads too. Just not writes in either department. Latency is obviously because of NVMe, while the difference in write speeds speaks to the 750's server hardware heritage.
You can get an adapter card and stick it in a regular PCIe slot.
Ivy(5%) -> Haswell(5%) -> Broadlel(0%) -> Skylake(5%)Your math's shit.
The 850 Pro has best in class latency for SATA SSDs.
How many lanes does it require? Normal PCI slot wont work i guess?
>pronobody buys thoseeverybody is getting EVO's and keep recommending them
Irrelevant statistics without showing the power consumption.For all we know those 5% could come with a 99% decrease in power consumption and be literally the biggest advancement in technology ever, or not.
>samsung has shit latency across their SSD modelsI don't see how your allegations about what people buy are relevant to this.
PCI and PCIe aren't even the same physical slotsDon't mix them up.
3.0 x4 to be optimal, though you could probably get away with 3.0 x2 or 2.0 x4
Intel focuses on power reduction so they can move into the mobile markets. Performance is irrelevant, and lets be honest, it more or less peaked for general use with a64.
TDP's for Skyshit are 95W Bigger than Haswell, and certainly bigger than Broadlel
When will they finally improve single core performance. This is so ridiculous, at this point intel is just allowing AMD to have a bit of market share.There is no competition in the consumer CPU market.
Time to bring back netburst from the grave.And make the bibeline even longer.220tdp as a start.
>Did we reach the limits of what CPUs can do?no, we reached a situation where one company has a de facto monopoly on CPUs. AMD hasn't been able to really compete with intel in terms of performance since the first Core i series, and the gap only got larger each generation.Now, why would intel make expensive new chips, when slight improvements on the older ones will still be more powerful than what the 'competition' has to offer?There's simply no reason for them to do. As much as people hate intel for all their bullshit, if you want a laptop cpu that doesn't suck your battery dry like a thai hooker sucks your cock, or a desktop CPU with proper performance, you have to buy intel.This is the future we choose...
>tfw fell for moar coresoh well, my 1090T (hexacore Phenom II) is still fast enough for my purposes, so I'll just use that till it goes up in smoke
2500kfags have to be the most obnoxious shits on /g/. Yes, it was a god tier CPU at the time, but every i5 iteration has been better. Why would I it when the 4590k exists?On another note, Zen please deliver. If you can destroy whatever Skylake-E brings out, that would be swell to all of us.
>16 core Zen AMD CPU>Much stronger per core performance>95w TDP>Directx 12 around the corner that'll utilize more CPU coresWill AMD save us from these shitty 5% Intel chip upgrades?I personally hope so.
>16 coresthat's all fine and dandy, too bad that most end-user applications only use 2-4 cores at mostAMD really needs to get their single core performance up
No-one is saying that you should get 2500k, just that if you already have one, there's very little reason to upgrade.
Im aware of that, but since i would need an adapter card anyway, i could get one for one of my PCI slots, because both of my PCIe slots are pretty much hidden by my graphics card
>AMD really needs to get their single core performance upZen will have significantly better per core performance.
>2500kfags have to be the most obnoxious shits on /g/. Yes, it was a god tier CPU at the time, but every i5 iteration has been better. Why would I it when the 4590k exists?Spotted the deluded consumerist.

All non jews will defend this?  Do you even know the meaning of the shit you sprout here?
FIVE %IVE%
At least 5% is 3 times of 1.7
5 is still more than 3.5 :^)
2500k is the goat of cpus. Just because newer stuff is 5-10% faster doesn't mean shit when you had that for 3 years now.
but its not even 2x 3.5
I was planning on upgrading at skylake but it's really just because I picked a shitty motherboard back in 2011 (gigabyte p67a-ud3p) that has a garbage layout and my gpu in the top x16 slot blocks my sata ports and the bottom x8 slot blocks my front panel usb3.I'll probably not upgrade until something breaks at this point.
4 years and a little over 4 months, and the devil's canyon counterpart is only 20-25% faster clock-for-clock.
I don't want to be excited anymore. Skylake was insanely hyped and turns out to be shit. Why would AMD Zen be any different? What if it will be a failure as well?
Excuse me?
Xeon 5650 is still the best Intel CPU.Not the fastest anymore but for $80 used holy fuck, AMD is BTFO
Oh. You use Windows. Real impressive.
>WAAAAH YOU USE WINDOWSJesus fuck, grow up. Let people use whatever OS they want. Besides, you'd only bitch and cry of your flavour of Linux were to suddenly become swamped with newbies with no clue, constantly shitting up the Linux forums with clueless questions.
Trust me, they won't use CentOS, or Slackware, or SUSE, or Fedora.Ubuntu and Mint would take 95% of the damage, I'd be reaping the rewards far away from the throng of stupid.
I don't use Linux, I use OS/2.
Not sure which of you I'm aiming this to, so I'll just quote you both;Regardless of how it'd affect you really, such petty attitudes towards someone choice is childish. If I was to try and proclaim that my OS does something best (bar something like gaming on Windows) then it'd be understandable, but the sudden, unfounded aggression just because someone uses a different OS is bloody stupid.

Why don't they just make CPU's bigger?I'm assuming that they could just cram for transistors in there, more room for stacked 3d v-ram,Larger area for i-GPU installationsI mean it's not like making a larger chipset with accompanying motherboards would be too hardCan someone please fucking tell engineers to stop making everything smaller for the placebo consumerist shitglamour?MAKE TECHNOLOGY BIGGER AGAIN!

Runs at about 55C under load, which isn't bad for a six year old CPU in a country where birds burst into flames mid flight.
There's a lot of competition on the mobile front and the Atom is very quickly improving in performance. The Atom X7 is around 80% the speed of the Core M yet consumes significantly less power.The X7 will never exceed 8 watts when thrashed but Core M will spike up to 30 watts before the temperature catches up real fast.
When do they release them?I'll finally throw my shitty AMD CPU into the trash bin where it belongs!(it was a fx8150 so yeah it was a complete piece of shit)

Its always potentially worth getting something with more power if you need it.
Probably

why do you need to upgrade

But you need to spend more money.
>all these retards who know nothing about IC designThis board is terrible
I'd personally wait for Zen and see how that turns outif it's shit, you can still get an intel later and maybe even a bit cheaperit's not like you actually need a faster CPU right now
>it's not like you actually need a faster CPU right nowI thought as much,thanks /g/
Wait for Zen, no point of upgrading atm.
No Broadwell? Those will be here in June.
broadwell is pretty much dead unless you want to buy iris graphics in a desktop
>mfw Broadwell is pretty much dead on arrival
I guess it depends on the price. Right now 4790k's are getting down to ~$300 on sale and since the improvements are so marginal, I doubt that it'll make it worth spending more
Agreed. The only reason I can think of is PCIE v3.NVMe and M.2 will not be relevant as long as there are pcie risers for them.
Same.3570K @ 4.5Ghz here and I feel no need to upgrade for a good while if AMD doesn't step up it's game.
Reminder that Zen has 40% higher IPC than Excavator.Reminder that Excavator has 5% higher IPC than Steamroller.Reminder that Steamroller has significantly lower IPC than K10.5 Husky cores.

They use actual IP addresses, they talk about computers in terms that people that frequent this place can readily understand - the show isn't dumbed down in the slightest and it's accurate in terms of technical content.It's also basically about fucking over the system.How can this not be the talk of /tv/ right now?Are you people just fucking stupid or what?>the irony of having to check a box to confirm I'm not a robot when trying to create a thread about Mr. Robot is not lost on me, seriously>this is an awesome show and it's just going to get better as time passesIf there was ever a TV show that /g/ and even /tv/ could grasp and comprehend and think "Yeah, that's me..." this is it, kids.
Looks edgy and not at all based in reality.Maybe if I was 12 and still listened to Linkin Park.
It was pretty good, too bad he's a huge beta cuck
yea, I love movies where people in dark hoodies sit at their computer and hack the gibson while browsing dank memesF$ck the Systsem! x*D
>flick the system.?
Not from the U.S., will torrent it.
>isn't an overweight loser>doesn't just mope through the day doing nothingHow could anybody on 4chan relate to this?
Why are you shilling American TV on an anime board?  Go back to your employer and tell them it was suggested they think back on what they learned in marketing school about "target audience," and ask whether a group of people who have publicly opted out of brain-dead American shows are in your target demographic?
Domo arigato
"le look at me I'm so deep, I'm so edgy!" the tv show.why can't these cunts get autism and social retardation right. it isn't that the guy should be there twitching like he's a fucking epileptic, it would be more realistic if he just was standing by the side not taking interest in people around him or what those people do, and this fuck does the complete opposite of that autism. Also "hacking" jesus fuck
'cause this ain't a fucking "anime board" I suppose, and 4chan was directly featured on the pilot episode in several instances on the guy's fucking monitors I suppose.But anyway, fuck you and everybody that looks like you.
4chan was features on fox news as well, should we all start watching that now, Mr Murdoch?
fuq da systarm
watching it now anon. seems pretty good so far. i like the awkward dude Elliot, he doesnt come off as a knob just socially awkward. Was surprised to see Christian Slater in it. I thought it might make it kinda shit, you know all about him being a film star but hes pretty cool also. with halt and catch fire start again next week its pretty good time for decent geek shows.
USA premiered it online, you can watch it here.>http://www.comingsoon.net/tv/trailers/443271-usa-network-debuts-the-mr-robot-pilot-episode-online
This subtitle made me laugh.
kek even subtitle ain't here for this shit
Fuck this 2edgy4me BS. If you want a show about IT that's based in reality you should be watching Halt and Catch Fire.
well he DID play slater in the last 2 seasons of Archer, so you know he can be cool on TV
shouldn't you be off masturbating to 12 year olds or something?
>12 year oldsdisgusting, who'd masturbate to a grandma like that?
Uh, it doesn't actually air until the end of next month?Watching it later tonight, but I don't know why you're expecting hype for a USA show that hasn't even aired yet
I'll check out the pilot. I usually hate "hacker" characters, but I have nothing better to watch right now.
amazingthis show's just like Person of Interest only it's absolute shit
>show starts with the protag swatting a CP ring just because he feels like it>it's also basically about fucking over the systemwow, what world do you live indon't waste the bandwidth, it's shit
God forbid cable TV shows be ridiculous, dumb, and just for fun
sure if you like but OP seems to identify pretty strongly with the show, that just strikes me as abjectly pathetic so i'm trying to discourage it
I can't remember the last time I watched TV.>wrote smugly the guy who spends ~12h/day in front of the monitor
The entire of 4chan is anime. Just because you're new and don't like anime doesn't mean 4chan isn't about anime anymore
>4chan was directly featured on the pilot episodethis is supposed to be a good thing?
>Burgers still have TVsNo wonder your country is dumb as fuck
4chan has always been an anime site dumbass.
Get a load if these faggots. 4chan is /b/
4chan was founded to be an anime sitejust like the assholes who said "why does this anime shit belong on adult swim" cause thats what it was made forduh
>Launched on October 1, 2003, its boards were originally used for posting pictures and discussing manga and anime, as the site was modeled on Japanese imageboards. The site quickly became popular and expanded, though much of 4chan's content still features otaku, anime, and other Japanese cultural influences.>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan
Wow, a wiki link from a weeb. This changes nothing
> TV show Maybe my grandma watched it
Because shitposting in a thread about a TV show you didn't watch is much more productive than actually watching a show, amirite?
>The website began in 2003 as a forum for teenagers with an interest in Japanese comics, but quickly sprouted multiple message boards, the freak show of which is the infamous /b/ board.>http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/what-if-the-vigilantes-at-4chan-move-beyond-minor-acts-of-vengeance-and-mischief/article1379975/
The point -> .you
>4chan was started as a project by Christopher "moot" Poole, a user of a small IRC/DC community known as Raspberry Heaven, which was [then] composed of users from the "Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse" (ADTRW) sub-forum of The Something Awful Forums.http://www.4chan.org/faq#about
> They use actual IP addresseslol?Nonetheless the first ep was okay
I'm surprised you're not avatarfagging with pictures of a cartoon little girl
>.373seems legit
This is a technology board. TV shows are not technology. You want /tv/, /thingsoldpeoplecareabout/ or blog.aol.com

I don't particularly like anime, anon. The last one I watched was Lain and that was a few years ago now. But denying 4chan's past because "muh sekrit hecker club is less cool with animu" isn't something I'm going to do. Kill yourself.
>he hurt my fee-fees>better call him edgyshouldn't you also call him out on being a fedora?
dont you know, everything past 255 is sekrut hakker subnetbytesize does not apply to these guys.
>mfw they went past the .255 so that neets wouldn't start pinging that shit to oblivion
> not watching TV> edgyI don't use buggy whips either. Except when I'm with your mom
Everyone understands the issue right? You can't have a fully "legit" hacking show because then the only people interested are such a small portion of the possible viewers (who just pirate it). It always ends up getting dumbed down or hand-waved or Wargamed so everyone can follow along, which pisses off the nerds but keeps the show alive.
I know, I use a 3-state-qubit quantum system as well, but usually that is used with IPv9, which uses a three dimensional holographic address notation
>implying you're an alpha
>not just covering up the first part of the address>hand.133.7.88
That's too cliche, normies don't know about the .255 part so it's okay.

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834232376Old Acer fan is dead, screen looks like low quality satellite tv feedI'm poor, will this laptop do?
hi /g/I need some new ideas for my final year project where do you propose that i look for inspirationmy major is computer science
bump
What a time to be alive
Who uses 1366x768 and isn't afraid to admit it?Honestly it only started to bother me after finding out about /g/.
It bothered me well before then. Can't view a whole a4 page and still be able to read it on such a low res screen. My ancient pentium m laptop with a 1400x1050 res was better.
oh godI was fucking around on a friend's laptop with that res the other day and was surprised anyone can live with that resolution let alone use it as their everyday PC.
My laptop has a 1366x768 screen.God damn business laptops.
yes it annoys the fuck out of me too actually but this laptop is just so fast and I like the keyboard too much.I mean as energy inefficient the 3230m may be it's so much faster than those new ULV processors.
It's usually freetards posting in the desktop threads, they have nothing else to do, can't browse the web or watch good porn, so they have to rice their desktop. Next time you go through the post your desktop thread, look at the screen resolutions, you'll see.Now, I don't blame them though, Linux does seem to work better on smaller resolution screens than Windows. After my last 1366x768 laptop, I vowed never to use that resolution again (it was 5, maybe 6 years ago, and they're still peddling that shit).
mobile phones are 1280x720 minimum nowadays, obviously laptops should've been 1080p by now.
That's nothing. I have to deal with on everyday.It's a good laptop but Jesus Fucking Christ, a 1366 x 768 screen on a Haswell Ultrabook?
>ultrabookAre you sure it's not one of those cheap ass i5-42xxU laptops?
Most phones are actually 1080p
keyword: minimum.
I don't think I've ever actually seen or used an LCD with a higher vertical res than 768. That'd be a nice thing to see sometime, maybe I'll look into getting one of those 1600x1200 screens for my T60 sometime.
My 10 inch laptop uses that resolution, but the screen is the most vibrant and crisp display i've seen in my fucking life, which is pretty funny.
Heh yep.
Me on my laptop, I don't care.>Honestly it only started to bother me after finding out about /g/.you cares to much about what /g/ think
I use it on my Laptop, and I use 720p on my phone.For my computer, no. Because the way I see it, big fucking monitor's better have a good resolution.Tiny fucking phones that aren't any longer than my dick don't need to be 1440p.
the only reason phones went past 720p is because they compete on specs nowadays. Fedoras thinkt hey have a better phone if it has 8 cores, 4gb of ram and an ultra HD screen.
Nope, i7 with the fancy grey sticker.Got it for free from work. I'm not complaining but I have to stare at that god awful resolution for 6 hours a day.
Yeah. That's why I went with the Compact.If they made a 5" phone with like 3000+ mAH like they do now days, but still retain 720p, I'd be okay with that too.However the Z3 Compact is more than enough of a power saver to me. I can play games straight for 6~7 hours and I don't ever spend anymore than 3~4 hours of time where I can't use it (walking, driving, etc.)My laptop is 13" so, not that big.
You hold your phone much closer to your face than laptop screen, that's the reason
i think my graphic card is too overkill
I do. And since I just use a WM it's bearable.But that is going to change in a week or two. waiting for my new X1 3rd gen.
I have to use it on my work computers. Everyone else has nice IPS monitors but I'm an intern so I don't get one :(
i use 1360x768better readability and smoother animations
>768 vertical res>better readabilityPick one and only one.
It started to bother me when people in desktop threads thought I have a laptop.
compared to 1920x1080? yes. the only people who would say different are squinters who sit 2 feet away from their monitors
Your problem is that you conflate dpi/resolution with shitty font scaling.
that isn't a problem on CRT monitors
>2004, time for college>buy laptop>Fujitsu Siemens, 1920x1200>never looked back
>1600x900>1400x1050My first laptop had a 15" screen with 1280x800 and using it now after using these thinkpads feels comical.
You must either be too poor to afford a laptop with a good screen or a retard.
And you're still doing it. Higher resolution and higher dpi makes things more readable, period. Go try and read an a4 page on 1360x768 vs 1920x1080 without scrolling to see what I mean. The only problem is shitty operating systems that still assume a fixed dpi and render shitty sized fonts. Using a CRT won't fix that.
I used a 1366x768 monitor for years. I replaced it with a 1440p monitor about a year ago. I just can't understand why I didn't replace it earlier
My 13" laptop is 1366x768 and it's perfectly fine for the distance I look at it from. 15" notebooks that ship with it are retarded and things look Xbox huge, but on small screens it's not too bad. My desktop monitors have a pretty decent PPI so I do know what I'm missing.

I have one simple question and that is, why on Earth would you use an OS like Linux when you could simply pirate a copy of Win7 and not have to worry about the pain of making sure drivers and games are compatible, as well as software such as the Adobe Design Suite? Everyone that I have met that has used Linux have some sort of god/superiority complex because they use a hipster OS.

>could simply pirate a copy of Win7 and not have to worry about the pain of making sure drivers and games are compatible, as well as software such as the Adobe Design Suite?sort answer is: "some people may find more convenient to use linux", of course gaymers and graphic designers aren't part of this category. And I think you are overestimating the drivers issue. >Everyone that I have met that has used Linux have some sort of god/superiority complex because they use a hipster OS.You've met shit people, every (and I mean every) linux user I've met doesn't brag about his OS, except maybe a guy at my uni that always add the line "this presentation was made with free software" to the first slide of every presentation he make.

You only say that because you're still young enough to think it's a good thing.

Cool.Yeah same here, uplay can fuck right off. Don't think I've ever got a game with a launcher to work with wine, with the exception of GW2, which ran like shit anyway.
It works.
Still a pity to see that people here run almost entirely free software except for gaming. We as a free software community should really strive for better free/libre games.

Because I want freedom, and maybe a lot of people want games that respect their freedoms too.Imagine how big the modding communities would be if people could actually change source code, instead of only doing what the developers allowed you to do.
That's all well and good but I can't see it happening. Game developers, more than most developers, do not want scum messing with their holy creations, beyond what they allow.
I think it works. People who want your game for free can pirate it anyway. You can still sell it, even when it remains free software.
Well, Space Engineers recently released the full source code. The game is still not free, but at least you can compile it yourself lolsource: http://blog.marekrosa.org/2015/05/space-engineers-full-source-code-access_40.html

Reading up on it, it looks like libav really dropped the ball, then.Apparently they /were/ being shipped with debian and then 3 years later it turned out most of the debian team would prefer FFmpeg and no-one else really cared.

That last line mostly applies to /g/.  Lots of shit slinging here for no reason.  I use Windows on my desktop and Linux on my laptop.  I have uses for each.  But it's mostly because I want to and that's really the only reason that matters.  I think of /g/ as entertainment and take no opinions here seriously.

fc20 because i'm still testing the performance of the kernel 3.17 with the radeon driver. i686 because i'm too lazy to compile everything for 64bits.because i have a server to play with some friends, we create our own maps and stuffs game is still awesome if you can create new content for it.

sweeti've worked out how i'm going to add the extra card, i've noticed i don't actually have any slots/space below the mobo, so i'm going to have to have the card outside the case (on an anti-static bag to start with, maybe i'll make a little box for it)should be fun

Are you really supporting a shit player for no reasons other than emotional attachment? If you don't use a player that is as robust as mpv, you shouldn't even be allowed to post on /g/.

o_O
>How about you download a REMUX and play the proper fucking thing instead of streaming compressed pixelated garbage?This isn't about playing movies over streams. It's about playing streams from every major streaming site. It's nice to have full support for everything. I play all my stuff from PTP and I stream Youtube, etc on the same player: mpv. Feels good man.
madshi will always ignore any criticism to his software, he says madVR it's optimized to hell and back, to the point of having different lanczos implementations for each scaling factorBut somehow with mpv I can use much heavier settings than in madVR. smoothmotion, lanczos, and color management with a 128x128x64 matrix meanwhile with madVR it was smoothmotion and lanczos or DXVA scaling and color management with the puny 65x65x65 matrix
So now, for MPC-HC to be comparable to mpv it needs>livestreamer>ReClock>xy-vsfilter>madVRAnd configuring all of them... so incredible easy
Why does the matrix size matter? What is the benefit(s)?
Also most of the sites on that list are like what you get on smart TVs where only 3 of the apps out of the 300 advertised are useful.
I can actually watch stuff on mpv without waiting for it to buffer a zillion years, unlike youtube HTML5 player, with Flash shit would simply crash from time to timeYou can load a playlist of music videos and watch them with great quality
Not everyone feels that a even more placebo preset is needed
Bigger matrix more points to correct color, it's not much of a benefit if the display has a pretty linear color tracking, but some displays are pure shit and are really helped by a bigger matrixThis page might help you understand betterhttp://www.displaycalibrations.com/
You can use browser extensions to force Youtube to buffer the entire video instead of having it only be so far ahead.>Using Youtube to listen to music.Jesus fucking Christ.
Not listening to music, I watch music videosIt buffers much faster in mpv than in Youtube, so I don't have to wait at all, I have no idea why this happens
>I can actually watch stuff on mpv without waiting for it to buffer a zillion years, unlike youtube HTML5 player, with Flash shit would simply crash from time to timeThis. It is objectively the best way to watch Youtube.
>watching musicYou went even more retarded.
>stop liking what I don't like
Youtube is fine for music. 720p and 1080p have decent bitrate audio.
I found some odd MKVs on YT that only FFMPEG stuff could play or modify. It was even crashing my video editors and compression tools.
You don't need reclock, vy-vsfilter is deprecated and madvr is only to make it look like mpv only dreams of looking likeAll you need to configure is madvr and that takes less time than editign the config file for your meme player v
>Watching potato people rubbing each other up with music dubbed over the top of it.

Configuring madVR takes much more time than just wirting --vo:opengl-vhqYou still need ReClock if you want your stuff to run at 24 hzmadVR looks worse than mpv, it lacks properly implemented scalers, and it lacks better softer Jinc scalers perfect for anime, it also lacks proper color management, since it doesn't even do BT.2020 right, and yCMS has always been shit, it can't even use a matrix bigger than 65x65x65Oh, and madshi couldn't even properly implement JincmadVR doesn't even do sigmoidized upscaling, what a punny rendererYoutube nowadays uses 192 kbps MP3, which is transparent for pretty much most casesFLAC doesn't have any use outside archiving

Maybe because Youtube is casual?
Never trust multimedia devs when they said their software is “optimized to hell and back”.What they mean when they say that is this: https://github.com/SAPikachu/flash3kyuu_deband/blob/master/src/flash3kyuu_deband_sse_base.hMeanwhile mpv's version is not only faster by an order of magnitude or two but also significantly more concise, readable and maintainable: https://github.com/haasn/gentoo-conf/blob/master/home/nand/.mpv/shaders/deband.glsltl;dr windows programmers simply SUCK at multimedia software, and so do most Linux programmers. You'd think it's fucking rocket science or something.Also I wonder what hardware he's tested on / you're running on. mpv's shader is biased towards AMD cards, so you'd get something like 50-100% better performance out of an equivalently priced AMD card than an Nvidia card.
I guess if you for some reason love judder mpv is an option.

Funny because I never experience these issues, but maybe if you're using a potato for playback you may experience just that.
MPC-BE mastah-ricers, WW@
Who SMplayerif not you are probably a faggot
mpv has more and better interpolation options than madVR, it contains code to fix/work around the stutters inherent in matroska files (which no other player does afaik), it has code to tune the playback speed to eliminate long cycles (eg. in the style of ReClock), and there's even a WIP branch giving it RetroArch-style dynamic rate control.I doubt madVR will ever have any of those. But sure, use mpv if you want judder, riiight.>it never ceases to amaze me just how fucking clueless MPC-HC users are about video rendering
Stop posting this shit thread cuntMPC is fine, lacks some features but who gives a shit
And all that doesn't matter because opengl on Windows is shitty. And you can't automatically switch refresh rate either.
No, you're just too fucking imperceptive to even notice them. The stutters goes straight over your head. By saying you don't notice them you are essentially just saying that you literally have a shitty perception of quality.I know for a FACT that without ReClock you will experience stutter, because it's a mathematically provable fact caused by the 0.1% clock drift inherent in virtually all media files.ReClock is one of the only tools that can actually actively counteract this (by adjusting playback speed to compensate). MPC-HC won't do it on its own.Ergo, if you are not even using ReClock, you are LITERALLY watching an inferior playback experience full of microstutters and judder that you probably don't even perceive because you've spent so much fucking time looking at shitty renderers that you've developed stockholm syndrome.>it never ceases to amaze me just how fucking clueless MPC-HC users are about video playback
>MPC-HC lacks some features but who gives a shitThe mating call of the pleb. Stop being retarded and plebby and just use a real video player. If mpv lacked features you'd call it shit, but when MPC-HC lacks features, it's "fine". You double-standard spouting woman.

And it only matters for the current approach.With the video-timed DRC, the only prerequisite is functioning vsync, which even Windows can into. (The only side effect of bad dwm rounding might be measurably slightly faster or slightly slower playback, but it should be imperceptible)So yes, it WILL fucking matter even for users of a pleb OS.>And you can't automatically switch refresh rate either.mpv has been capable of doing this for like a year.

I just use mpv to watch my favorite superstars do their thing
Over your head
Can't you use X.org's multihead support to run different servers off different GPUs?This is actually something I would be interested in, in theory - I'd love to buy a cheap workstation card for the 10-bit output capability, but use a cheap gaming card in order to render video for it.Basically, I'd need to render OpenGL on the gaming card and then transfer the image onto the workstation card somehow to be able to output it.I wonder if this is possible at all.
You can only have two seperate instances of X, you can't have them each drive a monitor but have a proper multi monitor setupXrandr just doesn't work
And yet I get ridiculous judder when mpv is fullscreened, regardless of whether dwm is turned on or off using AMD GPU. But sure, there are no issues whatsoever, and clearly PEBCAK.>xrandrYeah.
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Are you saying that running a single server + using Xinerama won't work? Well, that should be pretty obvious, shouldn't it?
Pretty sure gaming GPUs can output 10 bit just fine nowadays.
>dwm is turned on or offStopped reading there
Xinerama was actually the closest I got to genuine multihead workingXrandr wouldn't display on the second monitor at all, it detected it and everything fine thoughMaybe the garbage foss drivers are to blame
>Windows 8
Can you name a SINGLE card, and a SINGLE driver for that card that can measurably, demonstrably output in 10-bit quality?I will test whatever setup you want me to test. I have a GTX 970 and an AMD HD 7950 at my disposal, and I might even consider buying a new GPU just for this job if you can convince me that it runs with 10-bit output support.I have been researching this topic for years and the only working instance of 10-bit output support I have ever seen on a consumer card was using modified (hex edited) FirePro drivers on a HD 4870 (or 4890) in order to trick it into thinking it was a FirePro V8700 or something along those lines. Only then, only on Windows, and only if you disabled Aero and desktop compositing, did I get working 10-bit output.I would be ecstatic to find some sort of alternative *in existence*. If you can link me to a decent link, guide, driver revision or anything along those lines, I'd appreciate it.
>shilling

Do you also wonder why video games drop down to 20 fps when you set everything to ultra?
7950 should be just fine. http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/id-1863987/official-amd-radeon-representatives/page-2.html#11877715Don't know if it works on Linux, but on Windows you simply need to set desired bit depth somewhere in CCC and use application that can output it (for example MPC-HC+madVR in D3D11 exclusive mode).
Hmm. Certainly wasn't working on Linux, seems like it's Windows-only then? I might have to test it some day then. Do you know if it works in stuff like Photoshop as well, or is it just in fullscreen exclusive mode?It's a real shame because Nvidia cards are *supposed* to support 10-bit output on Linux, but the drivers for it are just so buggy that it doesn't actually work in practice.Also, do you know if this is just 10->8 bit dithering or does it actually drive the panel at 10 bit depth? What kind of connection do you need for it to work? Does it work over all connections, or are there limitations (eg. DisplayPort only)?
I've read that it does work with Photoshop.And no idea about the details, it's something that you probably need to test by yourself.
Looks the fucking same if this shit is on/off
What do you want 10-bit output for exactly?
Is there something similar to Ctrl+J on MPC-HC for mpv?
>playing youtube on a media playerDo you guys actually do that shit?
Then use the lower quality settings and enjoy your bad perception?
For watching movies
10-bit movies?
Any movies
... How is a 10-bit monitor going to improve the experience of watching movies with 8-bit color?
By displaying the rendered image with 10 bit depth instead of 8 bit depth?Why is this so hard to understand?
>Why is this so hard to understand?Everything you just posted. An 8-bit color video is going to look identical on a 8-bit monitor and a 10-bit monitor of the same quality. Playing gameboy games on an 8-bit colour monitor does not make those games have greater colour depth besides the original 2-bit grayscale.
>An 8-bit color video is going to look identical on a 8-bit monitor and a 10-bit monitor of the same quality.This is incorrect
>This is incorrectgo on. Why is that incorrect.
Well, because at the end of the rendering chain you need to dither down to the output depth.On an 8 bit monitor, this means covering the image with an 8-bit dither pattern, which can be noticeable and annoying.On a 10-bit monitor, the dither pattern approaches the limits of human depth perception.
>On an 8 bit monitor, this means covering the image with an 8-bit dither pattern, which can be noticeable and annoying.Why would you need to dither 8-bit video rendering on an 8-bit monitor? You'd need to dither if your were rendering 10-bit video on a 8-bit monitor, but not 8-bit. That should be pretty obvious.>On a 10-bit monitor, the dither pattern approaches the limits of human depth perception.Why would you need to dither on a 10-bit monitor at all unless you were pushing a video source that was >10-bit?
Look, I like mpv and I think it's a great piece of software, especially on GNU/Linux, but this is becoming a bit too much. I mean, when people used to share configs and debate scaling algorithms/placebo, the mpv threads were good. This is just advertising, even if it is free software. Come on, OP, I know you're better than that.
Because you need to render at a higher bit depth to reduce quantization error? Rendering at 8-bit is going to look pretty terrible.>Why would you need to dither on a 10-bit monitor at all unless you were pushing a video source that was >10-bit?Rendering is typically done at 16-bit depth.

>The video has to be encoded as 10-bit in the first place for that to be relevant afaik. We're talking about an 8-bit video source here.Quantization error is always relevant, especially when you're talking about 8 bit, because 8 bit is terrible to begin with. By adding quantization noise to the result you're getting something like an effective 7 or 6 bits of precision, which is simply going to look like ass.>Where? What are you talking about here exactly?Inside the renderer. You know, the component that takes the timeline of decoded images and displays it on your screen.
Looks nice. What did you do?

People use MPC-HC?
i will use mpc hcit just werks
yeah. they're called plebs.
>Enter a Youtube link into MPC-HCThe fuck is this shit. Is this even a feature. Why the fuck would I even want this feature. Whats the point of watching youtube on a media player other than youtube.
What's the point of watching youtube on a media player other than mpv?
If you unironically use the youtube player you should just leave /g/ immediately
http://mpv.srsfckn.biz/https://github.com/suhteevah/mpvhq-win64Which one?
>Whats the point of watching video on a video playerThis is how stupid you sound.
Kek it's funny how mpv has none of these on the standard build. You have to download haasns fork to even get any of these included in default. It's no different than downloading KCP instead of mpchc. Besides maybe when mpv has an equivalent to SVP that isn't complete shit I'll switch. Until then I'll leave you autists to sperg about your correct jinc implementation that you'd never be able to see in an abx test between the two. The truth is mpchc is best on Windows and mpv is best on linux. Deal with it.
>You have to download haasns fork to even get any of these included in default.But that's complete fucking bullshit.Name ONE feature that's present in haasn's fork but not mainline mpv.
rampant advertisingwhere are the fucking mods?
I'll have you know I don't know how to fix. (You)
Is mpv really that good?
But it does, libass is included in any build, reclock functionality is a simple script, the opengl renderer is included in every buildDo you even have any idea of what you're talking about?Also, hassn build doesn't really have anything more than mainline, the only thing that's different nowadays is the opengl-vhq presetYou have no idea of what you're talking aboutYou can have SVP through vapoursynth+MVTools, instead of relying on some russian botnet that's a ripoff of MVToolsSeemadVR shills are real, and have a reason to shill

Mpv had the ugliest ui. And why would you use mpc to stream from YouTube when you can open a browser and watch.
Are people seriously opening youtube links with another application now instead of viewing it in their browser? What's next?We disable images and view them on waifux2?
Placebo is a hell of a drug.
I want to enable dolby digital/dts passthrougg option on mac, but i have zero coding skill. I would appreciate help, so i can ditch all other players once and for all.
I go to youtube to search for youtube videos. Looking up videos in browser and copy pasting every link into an external player sounds like the biggest hassel.
>copy pasting every link into an external player sounds like the biggest hassel.There are extensions that launch mpv automatically. Also, it's not a problem when someone sends you a link to the video in chat or on 4chan.
Is there some kind of video quality improvement compared to watching it in your browser? I don't really see the point for caring about quality for youtube or any streaming for that matter.
>Is there some kind of video quality improvement compared to watching it in your browser?There is. There's also the benefit of using the familiar interface of your video player instead of being forced to use the awful interface of whatever  streaming site is behind the link.>I don't really see the point for caring about quality for youtube or any streaming for that matter.Agreed. I normally just use YouTube, unless I'm watching a web series (like Inferno Cop,) in which case it's nice to watch it in mpv and have the same experience as watching local video. It also uses my subtitle settings when I do this, which are a lot better than YouTube's ugly subtitles.
Well whatever suits you I guess. I typically just torrent entire series even if the only available source is from the web like netflix.

It's so fucking terrible, it goes beyond mere comparison. Even VLC is a blessing compared to web players. They're THAT fucking garbage
I don't know you use youtube, but I typically click through tons of videos. Obviously adding 2 clicks to a single video watched is insignificant, but adding 2 clicks to 100 videos is annoying as fuck.
>mpv fags stream their anime Why would you even get your music videos from Youtube?
>FOSSOpen source misses the point. You must be new if you're confused by the term "free software.">Also, FOSS can be shilled.No, free software can't be shilled. Even if you ignore all the definitions of the word "shill" that require the shill to be paid, free software benefits the community as a whole, not any specific organisation. It's not like the console war threads that you're used to shitposting in on /v/, where it's one organisation's commercial interests against another's, and they have a solid reason to pay real shills. If everyone used free software cross-platform video players like mpv, and no one used proprietary shit like madVR, digital video as a whole would be better.
>free software benefits the community as a whole>commercial software"Hey, ya know, this thing could really use a GUI.""Right on it!">freetard software"Hey, you know...""WORKS ON MY MACHINE PATCHES WELCOME IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT JUST FORK IT WHY DON'T YOU LEARN HOW TO USE A COMPUTER IF IT'S NOT POPULAR THAT'S FINE WITH US!"
So you use a "commercial" video player now? Which one?
Commercial software benefits the community by getting programmers to program software that's useful to them instead of shilling their hobbyist video player on 4chan 24/7.
It is impossible to shill free software.
Not every freetard project is bad.  Some follow the commercial product model and strive to deliver fully featured programs.MPC-HC is one of them.  MPV is not.  Thus your inferiority complex and continued shilling.
>Some follow the commercial product model and strive to deliver fully featured programs.>MPC-HC is one of them.What? Now I don't understand at all.What exactly is the "commercial product model" and why do you think MPC-HC is "following" it? Do you think GUI-based free software is uncommon? Is the only way you can reconcile hating free software and using free software to tell yourself that the free software you use is really commercial software in disguise? When someone makes a commercial command line program, are they following the "free software product model?"Also, this thread of discussion was originally about shilling and now it's about GUIs? Are we going to just keep switching topics until you find one that you can feel superior about? I don't hate GUIs. I wouldn't mind if there was a good cross-platform free software GUI-based video player, but the one we have right now is CLI-based, and that's fine too.
hi/tv/ herei'm a fan of windows media player and was wondering if anyone could answer a quick questionwhat would it take to play a dvd's files (ie the movie itself) in windows media player?here's the previous thread before i was redirected here>/tv/56957054
>What exactly is the "commercial product model" and why do you think MPC-HC is "following" it?Tireless work to put out a product that meets the needs of the non-programmer end user.Bad freetard software uses "freedom" as an excuse to be shitty.  "If you don't like it you can program it yourself!"  Unfortunately there's this little thing called "division of labor," and it's a piss-poor economic model for everyone to learn programming and spend hours a day every day trying to get their software to work.Until mpv follows the commercial software model and actually releases a product that would be worth money, stop shilling it.
I agree. VLC is probably the best player out there.
So why are all the commercial video players awful?
Daily reminder that /g/'s contributions to mpv are close to zero and that main devs expressed disliking for the board and its users more than once. >HURR DURR SHILLING ON /g/You guys are hilarious, you sure like to pretend to be relevant to a fairly big project, don't you?
How the fuck would we know.  God, I haven't seen WMP since, what, 2006?A ton of DVDs are telecined so you should be going through avisynth, anyway.
Not allowing only one instance of the player === "shitty grade" software. That's how I feel about your player.
mpv can do this on Linux with the umpv script.

>he has to install a botnet to do what MPC-HC can do natively
Has "botnet" just replaced the word "program" for you? That script is from the official mpv repo.
>the script is from an unpaid neckbeard's official botnet repo>not a botnet
Can I run script from keybind o or h from mpv, I don't want to use wm or de's keys cause they would be complex like alt+shift+k or something like that.
Yeah, you can bind keys to the "run" command, followed by the location of the script and any arguments.
i'm using  mpv on windows  but audio output is not how is supposed to be.5.1 audio sources come from stereo speakers and nothing form surround speakers....how to?Protips?
Try exclusive mode. --ao=wasapi:exclusive
That said, it should work in shared mode too. I don't have a 5.1 system, so I can't test. Are your speakers set up properly? (In the sound control panel, right-click->configure speakers.)
 speakers are set up properly, sound card ok (x-fi music + creative gigaworks s750).I'm stupid guys , i'm trying to find the fucking config file to write down the code, and so on...
How do I use mpv to stream? using windows.
ok guys i did it, i created the config file inside MPV folder, added  ao wasapi stuff and now working.....Very nice....now i'll waste my time fucking around with the config file  kek
>not playing your music with mpv
Just mpv <stream url> from the Command Prompt. If it's from a streaming site like YouTube, you need youtube-dl.exe in the same folder as mpv.exe.You can also do it from the Run dialog (Win+R) if you install this: https://github.com/rossy/mpv-install
Glad it's fixed. I think it should work in shared mode too, but as I said, I only have a 2.0 system, so I don't know for sure and I wouldn't know how to debug it.
Is there a way to open directly in mpv youtube link from Skype directly ?
I do this too. I used to have a proper music library that I played with fb2k, but I've gotten too lazy for that. It's just folders and mpv *.flac now.
Like the « Open With » addon but for Skype.I want to avoid copying the link, open a terminal and paste the link into the terminal.
i'm using spdif passt for dts and ac3 but i have this error, any advices?
How can I adjust my eq presets in mpv like when using fb2k?
seriously considering switching to python from ruby. convince me to or no.
Is ruby even a thing anymore? I thought it died along with RoR
perl 6 is the only answer
Why even pick Ruby in the first place?
Probably learned during the times where it rained RoR dev job offers
numpy, scipy, matplotlib, beautifulsoupsuper easy prototypingBoost.python to use c++ when you need to
>to python>from railsYes I also like leaping from gorgeous penthouses into the dumpsters below
So you wanna sink with the ship?
Ruby'll be the fucking buried treasure.
What are you using it for? If you're actually pursuing some sort of career in programming, learn Java or C instead. Python and Ruby are both incredibly slow and similar so you're not going to diversify your skillset.If you just program for fun/to automate things, python is objectively the best choice. Way more libraries for interacting with applications and your computer
C++
OP here, I actually learned to program with python but then went to ruby for webdev jobs. I already basically know both I just don't know the finer points of python, don't know which packages are popular, not entirely comfortable with pip/virtualenv.I actually think ruby is a much nicer language but it just can't compete with python in the scipy number crunching area that I want to get more into. Python is goofy, its regular expressions are retarded, 2.x -> 3.x was/is a disaster. There also seems to be a handful of different libs for things like making system calls & threading & date/time shit despite the 'one way to do it' bullshit they spew. But maybe I've only seen the shitty side & at a time when I didn't really know what I was doing. So I think i'm going to give it a second chance.
Worth a shot. If you're used to rails, Django is really easy to get used to
They both suck. Clojure or at least Ceylon.
This place is messing me up, when I saw the thumbnail in the catalog I read it as cucked. It looks nothing like cucked...
Anyone here who switched from anything to assembly?I used to study pascal for school but I never found a chance to fully use it, so I haven't coded anything in years since high school ended. I want to get back into programming now and maybe CS later. Should I start over with assembly or stick with something similar to pascal?I thought if I'm gonna start from scratch, maybe I could try assembly to further "expand my horizons" and be prepared for the future. What do? Do you ever code in asm?
reduces bash/perl scripts by at least a third
>Ruby
But using python and then compiling it turns it to machine code. Java doesnt do that its stuck with its dumb vm and its a known fact that people arent updating their java jre anymore cuz tey are tired of oracle not being able to get their shit toghether since 1996. Visit the mediahub at DefCon and search for java and roll in the bounty of security holes in the vm. Java is shit and everyone is using it because everyone else is using it! The flashplayer of programing languages!
Is ruby like java,please say no:(
>There also seems to be a handful of different libs for things like making system callsWhat?  There's only one library, os.
Seriously wtf are these faces supposed to mean? I see these shitty reaction faces posted around and not certain if it means you are trying to laugh at OP or not.
Inability to recognize the emotions conveyed by facial expressions is a sign of autism.
Learn Javascript + Coffeescript. You probably already know it as a rubyfag. Then enjoy masterrace future of JS everywhere! XD
that's not how the english language works
>Inability to recognize the emotions conveyed by facial expression of a shitty animu drawingftfyIf you think that her look can mean only one single thingyou are the autist here
>convince me to or no.Why? Go ahead and pick up Python. It's fun.
>Learn Javascript + Coffeescript.>coffeescriptWhy would you do any such thing? Its basically a crutch for people too stupid to learn JS. There is no practical reason for jumping an additional hoop to write shitty JS.
Spoken like a true pseudo-js dev.
The fuck is that supposed to mean?I am currently employed as a web developer and write truckloads of jQuery and pure JS every day. I've looked into Coffeescript and it seems like a crutch for artsy designers to get some simple logic into their blogs without learning the horrible mess that is pure JavaScript.
Write fizzbuzz
I am going to assume you mean that counting game where you spot multiples of 3 and 5. for(var i=1;i<=100;i++){    var str="";    if (!(i%3)) str+="Fizz";     if (!(i%5)) str+="Buzz";     console.log(str || i); };
Python and Perl 5 are fine too. Ruby is just for slow people who can't make up their mind between Python or Perl. Also, gems are pain in the ass compared to cpan/pypi.
puts 'fizzbuzz'
Nah bro you should invoke a FizzFactory and BuzzFactory method on each condition, also making sure that you implement Fizzable, Buzzable, and Fizzbuzzable.That is of course after you've produced UML justifying your design choices.
Sounds like nodev fagshenanigans to me.
>seriously considering switching to python from ruby.You know you can use more than a single language right?
Yeah, but that causes your hair to fall out.

Is Elon Musk the Steve Jobs of the 2010s?

It depends whether he actually made his "inventions" himselfif (elonMuskInvents == true) { then elonMusk != steveJobs}else { elonMusk != steveJobs}
He's the Jesus of the 2010s, our fucking savior, not some insane autist who owns 120 of the same black turtleneck.

its Brianna Wu now, I don't need any mansplaining from you, shitlord
what's the point of these comparisons anyway
He's the aftershave of 2010.
Steve Jobs never made his own shit, Elon Musk might have or he may not have.
In my experience Musk isn't too much of an asshole, unlike what I've heard about Jobs. Also, Musk is actually a competent engineer. And while I don't reflexively hate on Apple products, launching shit into space and trying to get mass adoption of electric cars to succeed seems more important to me than getting consumers to drop another $800 on a new iPhone b/c its 1mm thinner than last years model.
NO.
He doesn't, he's just the CEO
Well if he hasn't made anything then he is like Steve Jobs.
>Not using Qbasic

He's actually really knowledgeable about rocket design. He's not Tom Mueller but he's much more than just a figurehead. The dude is intimately involved in all facets of the company and really knows his shit.

i know i know "its on the internet so it must be true"there's a couple of people on /g/ that supposedly work for spacex and said he's an extremely hard worker.

He's born and raised in South Africa you twit.
What did Steve Jobs invent?
profitable theft denial
Steve Jobs wanted to sell things so he could make money.Elon Musk made things so he could improve the world.
Yeah I got that, the whites were genociding the blacks
They certainly treated the blacks like shit but no they were not trying to commit genocide against blacks. Ironically, many believe that since the end of apartheid there has been an ongoing attempt to rid SA of whites, particularly in the rural areas through murder.
Elon Musk will probably die as a saint.Gentooman was glad Steve Jobs died.

So I'm working on this old guy's website and the old admin did some funny stuff. There is a custom CMS and a directory with log-in history. I think the guy made a mistake with concatenation with the php script because it logs the password obscurely in plaintext when the log-in fails. So if you fail the log in, I can figure out the incorrect password. What's funny is that the guy messed up his username while trying to log in so it gave me his correct password haha.
I sent my CV, cover letter and links to 5 sites that I coded to a digital agency that are looking for a junior front end dev last week. On Thursday they sent me a technical challenge to complete a homepage in 3 hours using bootstrap and for extra credit to embed a google map with custom icon,add a bunch of animations, and add a bunch of checkboxes that dynamically update a string in a h1 tag of how many checkboxes you've ticked.They got back to me today and said they won't pursue my application further.What do these companies want in a junior? I thought what I did in 3 hours was more than acceptable. Should I have not used a css animation library and jQuery?
Holy shit eclipse is bad.Is there any reason why I can't just use a text editor?
SQL is webdev. 
Nah dude, I guess you're right here. They can't expect too much by a junior dev.I don't think they didn'tn't take you because you didn't fulfill the requirements, I guess they just found someone who fulfilled them better.

I hate projects with jquery ui. shit always blows into my face, adds millions of classes and elements, always makes problems after updates.
css is great, don't be like that
When learning Angular you should go for TypeScript also.
You are going backend, correct?You have pretty much what I would put on a list. With Node.js, make sure you look into Express as well. Framework for Node that makes it much better to develop in the long run
So I'm using a php framework for the first time ever, it's called slim and I'm using this along Twig template(I never used a template system like twig)..and holy shit this is awesome. It's like using bootsrap but for phpThe problem I see is that there are not to many tutorials teaching me how improve my php skills using slim, so I'm asking you, do you know a php framework that is more or less easy to learn and has a shit ton of tutorials/guides/youtube videos/whatever?>inb4 "laravel 5". I don't know, that shit seems way above my knowledge.Also how do I organize my project using MVC pattern? Between using slim, bootstrap, sass(scss is for faggets) and gulpJs, my folder structure is pretty fucked at the moment
Yep, backend. Although companies who use node ask for either a frontend guy with node familiarity or a full stack.I'm planning to be able to work remotely by the end of the year. My fallback solution, if my node attempt gets shot down, will be to learn php.
You seem to be going for what most would go for. Just learn what you have on your todo list. You will eventually stumble upon technology while learning (I found Jade by accident, and its my favorite template system)
So, has Laravel finally made php developers out of their ostracism by the rest of the web dev community?
You are missing PHP and SQL
Also, Wordpress and bootstrap
see I'm leaving them last as fallback scenario.
Pretty much. Though you still might get hate from some
I would start with Front end HTML CSS first then Javascript,PHP,SQL, and lastly Wordpress and Bootstrap
Yep, that's how it'll go.
On and off about two yearsThat's all they said was build a homepage within three hours using bootstrap.For extra points it needed a responsive slider (I used owl carousel for this), user driven animations (I used wow.js and amimate.css) and a custom Google map (I used the Google map Api for this).I've spoken to a few friends who are senior debs and they seem to think they want to hire a medium level Dev at a junior level salary
Thats what it sounds like. Pretty shitty that happened, but some companies are like that. Keep trying, and you will find one soon enough.What city are you located in? Im curious
Capitalist pigs!Anyway I have another year left of my studies, I was going to leave and start working as the general consensus is that most people in web Dev are self taught anyway. Nevermind, I'll hopefully get a mid level job by the time i finish studying next year
Most Web devs are, but a lot of companies want a  CS degree, which is a piss off because I know a bunch of CS people who cant do any type of programming, and have a better chance than I do because of the degree
Any good resources to properly learn PHP? I checked plebbit's PHP sub but they claimed that the FAQ is outdated.
Don't judge them from what they ask on the job posting. If you're good they'll take you.
http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/82138/backend-developer-javascript-nodejs-carbonmade?searchTerm=node.jsThe face of autism.
Possible stupid question : why is angular a thing? Surely you'd want to use a backend framework like express that can link to a cms and a database to input new data rather than hard code it into angular.Example : I own a restaurant. I need to add new dishes to my menu. If the site is using angular, then all my dishes are in a controller that has been input by a Dev. To change that I have t have a working knowledge of angular and a text editor to add more dishes. If I had a backend Mvc framework that can communicate with a database ten I can add new dishes to the database using a gui cms interface.Have I misunderstood something or is this how it is?
;_;
this and php7. still wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole, but whateveroh god>Have I misunderstood somethingI think you did
I've been thinking of getting into webdev, I know c# a bit since before. Is ASP.net a viable framework to go with? I know C#, SQL. Thought I'd pick up html,css,javascript and build something with that.
last part for yes, asp.net mvc
For your example, proper usage of angular would be to retrieve the list of dishes from your backend and display it on the HTML page, possibly filtering or sorting them while doing so. You should not store the list of dishes itself within your frontend.In short, yeah you kind of missed the entire point of angular
sass made css fun again for me. And I don't even know the fancy shit, I just use the includes and nesting.
use a preprocessor
Thanks for clearing that up for me.In the codecademy tutorial they get you to put the product details in the controller on the front end which I thought was odd.So angular is all about sorting / formatting / displaying data on the front end?I'm guessing you need a small amount of knowledge of the backend to fully use angular to the best of its abilities?
>So angular is all about sorting / formatting / displaying data on the front end?Angular is specifically about simplifying the process of binding data you retrieve from a backend to your HTML page, specifically tailored for use in SPAs.>I'm guessing you need a small amount of knowledge of the backend to fully use angular to the best of its abilities?Generally speaking you should at least know how to communicate with a backend.
>a small amount of knowledge of the backendI'm currently building a service that will allow people to store small amounts of data online without having to deal with setting up a database etc.I'm using that for my smarthome to store the temperature and the humidity without having to setup a database only for that, I'm using the API I built. So theoretically, one doesn't necessarily need backend knowledge (although it's advised).
Does anyone have a working example of 3D text with three.js?  Something that is only a few lines.  I can't seem to get it working.
>3D text with three.jshttp://threejs.org/examples/webgl_geometry_text.html
Yeah, that's the only working example I could get, but it's like 500 loc.  I condensed it down to the relevant parts and compared it to other examples, but it never works.
they don't fix the fundamental problems inherent to css
Nothing can fix it so you will have to get over it and use tools to at least make the job easier
There is nothing wrong with css
CSS is the PHP of frontend development. Everybody hates it, but nobody can tell you why
I prefer PHP over Java
This.
I think Java is the most retarded programming language out of all of those ones I have tried. I have done Javascript, PHP, SQL, Bash scripting, Ruby, Java, and Python. Java is just a big headache.
We're having to deal with it at university here. It's okay, it's only half a year. But still, I don't see any use in it. Even a friend of mine who actually is a Java fanboy suggested me to use Python or something else for everydayneeds scripting.
Yes, stay away from it I have done two courses on it at university it's stupid.
sup /wdg/ I'm gonna be honest here. I'm totally lost. I want to into webdev but there are so many options out there I have no idea where to start. I dabbled in Laravel and found it pretty cool, but when it comes to JS and all of it's frameworks and tools I have no idea. I want to learn how to make web apps that are modern (SPA, good visuals). What path should I take to be able to do this?Thanks guys
>web apps that are modernDo you have something in mind? At least for me it's usually the best to get into something but working towards a goal - in this case it would be a specific website I'd have in mind. That's how I started to webdev, I coded a specific module that was needed (nothing big, some office stuff).
Well I have a few ideas, nothing I really need to make but some challenging stuff for practice. An web IRC client or a video chat app would be my ultimate goal. What I mean by modern is apps that aren't just static pages with some dynamic stuff, a full application
Well, as a PHP webdev, I'd suggest PHP for the backend (or some easy service to get started) and bootstrap (when I started I concentrated on the backend, not frontend). Later then you'll get frustrated with bootstrap and write your own CSS stuff.At least that's how it went for me.>web IRC clientThat sounds like some live thing with sockets and shit. I don't know anything about node.js, but I guess it's worth a look if that's your goal.
Basically you're gonna want to master the fuck out of JS and all its concepts. You'll eventually discover things that are a bit of a pain or common tasks that you have functions for in every single application you make.When you realize you're copy-pasting your boilerplate functions between projects, you'll realize that there's probably a better way. That's what libraries are. See what good ones are in the mix and be amused by them, then pick a couple to learn (jquery and angular).Libraries are nice for when you want to quickly achieve a common/easily expressable goal in a language.Frameworks are one or more libraries/templates across one or more languages. For example, Bootstrap is a framework that boilerplates a ton of css and has a js library/clusterfuck.Frameworks are nice when you want to quickly achieve a common/easily expressable goal in an entire web application (normally at the cost of originality, but not always).A good way to practice is by making games, like tic-tac-toe, minesweeper etc. playable in the browser. That'll let you practice with states and MVC stuff that you'll use in your SPAs.I'm still growing a lot in these ways too
Ok this is great, thanks anonNow one more thing, what specific framework would be best to learn right now for general purpose development? I know Angular is common, but I also hear about React and others. I know that eventually a framework will be super important to my projects, so I want to master at least one.
Where do I put the "About"-Button?
slim is for small projects, i think it does provides a default views directory (templates/) but i'm just guessing. anything bigger than a SPA or a restful service requires a different approach.
I personally try to stick to projects backed by Google. So I'd say Angular. I'm about to jump ahead and start making Angular 2.0 apps for my online resume.There's a lot of reasons I don't like Google, but it's undeniable that coding projects they start tend to stick around.Both are really great and there's a few others, but my choice wasn't made so much on features, it was on future-proofing.
Yeah I get a bit nervous about relying on "random" code in my projects (I'm new to webdev but not to coding in general). I just read about people using laravel as their backend, which feeds into angular, what do you think about this kind of approach?
>relying on "random" code in my projectsAn investment that will pay off 100 times more than libraries/frameworks is learning about best practices/organization/structure. Seriously.I'm not saying you need to be perfect in your early applications, but you'll certainly trip yourself up during them, wondering what the best way to do something is when you notice your code is turning out messy. Remember that, and learn how others are setting their stuff up. This is something I regret not taking seriously early on.Libraries won't be able to help with this much, but they're still really nice. Laravel is correct for PHP, but remember that front- and back- end are completely different faces.In other words, don't code your back-end API to return data in a way that perfectly fits your front-end application. Make the API return the data in the way that's its most intuitive data structure, and your front-end application can sort it out for how it'll use it from there.Also if you're going to use libraries it's often neat to look at their code to see how they implement some of the features you like. It's just good to have that experience imo
At the top obviously.
Where exactly? Whereever I put it, it looks shitty.
Guys, honestly, is Meteor a meme? I've been dabbing in it and everything is so simple. What's the catch?
Good tips, thanks again. I'm using webstorm on osx right now and it works well, is anything else recommended or is it pretty much a matter of preference?
Matter of preference.Most people tend to use Sublime Text 3 as a text editor and GitHub for version control/collaboration, but beyond that basically whatever you want.Personally, my task runner is Grunt (task runners do stuff like minify, compile, compress, move etc depending on what tasks you set up for a project), my FTP client is FileZilla, and my stack is XAMPP (someone please recommend me a better way, i feel like a faggot still using this).
Try a little square button with a question mark instead of "About."
Welp that's a smart idea.I'm not that much of a frontend dev.
Yeah I actually want to know if this is legit or not
Sorta off topic, but why is there a web dev general and not a software dev general? Especially since /g/ is always like "hurr durr web dev is not real programming".
There is a few annoyances I have with it, but not as much as people seem to make it. Ive used it for so long that all my gripes with it are gone, but I can understand from a beginners perspective that it can be annoying
/dpt/ pretty much covers that, but I guess it could be useful to have one
I think this thread includes web designers too, and not just purely programming.
Sorta not answering your question but people seem to think that web development is grabbing a CMS and adding some widgets and sometimes or custom javascript.Other guys realize that using an MVC, adding routes, writing models is not programming.But people that have faced real challenges (not daily crap clients want) realize that in those cases web dev can turn into heavy shit programming.
I have a question I'm hoping someone may be able to help me with. I'm a second year Mechatronics Engineering student living with my parents, I've done a few general CS courses and have a rough grasp on things like Python and Pascal. Most of my experience is in C doing embedded system type stuff though.Having no experience in web dev at all, how reasonable of a goal is it for me to want to learn as much as I can in my spare time (about to have a few weeks off for mid year break) to be proficient enough to start looking to make some money by the end of the year? I'd like to supplement my shitty retail job with something that I actually enjoy and am challenged by, and something that may be worthy to put on my resume in the future.
That feeling when you've more or less finished another project after a night of coding.Aww fuck yiss now I'm gonna find a few betas and then I'll launch the page. Yess.If you have already some programming knowledge, there's a chance that you'll find a company that hires untrained webdevs. As a junior you wouldn't make a shitton of money, but only a few weeks won't make a difference there anyway.
Who typescript here?I'm hype as fuck for Ecmascript6
Vanilla or bust.
typescript is basically ecmascript6, which comes out in a month or two. so it's going to be vanillaalso good luck doing object oriented programming in js without the ease of being able to say "class", "extends" and "super"It's possible but having those key words makes things so much easier
what exactly do you want to learn?
It's really not hard typing "prototype" before a function.
but fatal bug appears and you shit yourself
Nah. The project is a one man simple project, any fatal problem can be fixed in an hour tops.
like this?function obj = {};obj.prototype.dicks = function(){ console.log("dicks"); };function ob2(parent){var that = {};for property in parent.prototypethat.prototype[property] = parent.prototype[property];return that;}cocks = new obj;morecocks = ob2(cocks);
What music do you listen to while you are "in the zone?"
or... this?function dicks(){this.dicks = "dicks";}function cocks(){that = this;function cocks(){parent = new dicks();for property in parent.prototypethat.prototype[property] = parent.prototype[property];}this.dicks = "I overwrote dicks.dicks";}
or this?<!doctype html><html><head><meta charset="utf-8"></head><body></body><script>function base(x, y){    this.x = x || 0;    this.y = y || 0;}base.prototype.func = function(){ console.log("func()"); };function child(x, y, speed){    for ( key in e = new base(x, y) )        this[key] = e[key];    this.speed = speed || 0;}se = new child(10, 20, 30);console.log(se);// child inherits base's prototype functionse.func();console.log("x: " + se.x + "\ty: " + se.y);</script></html>
I listened to this earlier:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_c3JUf6EOU
>function dicks(){>this.dicks = "dicks";>}Yes.function xyz(value1, value2, ...valuen){  this.X = value1;  this.Y = value2;  this.N = valuen;}var obj_xyz = [];  obj_xyz[0] = new xyz(a,b,...,n);
How about this?var __extends = this.__extends || function (d, b) {    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];    function __() { this.constructor = d; }    __.prototype = b.prototype;    d.prototype = new __();};var Animal = (function () {    function Animal(name) {        this.name = name;    }    Animal.prototype.move = function (meters) {        alert(this.name + " moved " + meters + "m.");    };    return Animal;})();var Snake = (function (_super) {    __extends(Snake, _super);    function Snake(name) {        _super.call(this, name);    }    Snake.prototype.move = function () {        alert("Slithering...");        _super.prototype.move.call(this, 5);    };    return Snake;})(Animal);var Horse = (function (_super) {    __extends(Horse, _super);    function Horse(name) {        _super.call(this, name);    }    Horse.prototype.move = function () {        alert("Galloping...");        _super.prototype.move.call(this, 45);    };    return Horse;})(Animal);var sam = new Snake("Sammy the Python");var tom = new Horse("Tommy the Palomino");sam.move();tom.move(34);
was transpiled into javascript from this typescript:class Animal {    constructor(public name: string) { }    move(meters: number) {        alert(this.name + " moved " + meters + "m.");    }}class Snake extends Animal {    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }    move() {        alert("Slithering...");        super.move(5);    }}class Horse extends Animal {    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }    move() {        alert("Galloping...");        super.move(45);    }}var sam = new Snake("Sammy the Python");var tom: Animal = new Horse("Tommy the Palomino");sam.move();tom.move(34);
this sucks
That would definitely be ideal, not too concerned about the money, more interested in learning through experience. I'll have a look into it, thanks man. Honestly I'm pretty new to this and know next to nothing about web dev. Any suggestions to get me started quickly?
https://gist.github.com/paragonie-scott/bbd0403a992d40e9c71aWorking on the outline/API for an extension I'm going to try to develop for PHP that creates a PDO-like cryptography interface.Motivation: if something happens to openssl or libsodium (like what happened to libmcrypt), developers aren't married to the old API.
(That gist is a preliminary outline, I'm writing a PHP-land implementation first.)
It's java some java that recently fell to me. Don't have problem with the terminal, just new to java and it seems eclipse is what everyone else is using here.
how? 
Dindu nuffin today. Watched two movies instead and god knows what I did with the other time I had.
I was thinking of getting into .NET and ASP.NET MVC but in Yuropoorland I see tons of PHP jobs that ask for Wordpress, Drupal etc.Also, the ASP.NET ones are rarely MVC and they ask for previous experience and degree. What do I do? I like C# syntax more than PHP but muh jobs...
Fuck it, PHP.
Java is the closest thing you wrote there to C++. The reason you hate it is probably because you are not that good of a programmer. Java is shit but I would choose it over Javascript, PHP, Ruby or Python anyday. SQL is a query langauge and it's obvious what bash is.
Do php jobs pay decently? Assuming someone with no experience besides personal projectsI don't want work with the beast that is Java EE/Spring/etc and php frameworks seem the next most popular thing
The same fucking thing I've been doing for the last two years, luckily I'm starting a new job in a month. Still webdev, but at least something different.>tfw thinking about going into embedded systems or something but no experience = way less monies and I can't afford that at the moment

Footer, far-bottom in low-contrast font colorunless its real important
spring mvc
I made a little app with it for internal use and it's pretty good. I'd recommend it for things where the clients need to stay open and in sync with the server and each other all the time. Chats, status, group schedules, etc. Not for blogs or sales pages.There's for example clones of things like trello and slack, meteor makes them very simple to create, no need to do websockets and keep the dom updated by yourself.
Nginx
Also there's packages for working with postgres and mysql now if you think mongodb is a meme, haven't used them yet though.
I'm working on a manga reader project but I'm unsure how I'm gonna manage all the images of the pages. I have mysql PDO experience, the enviorment up and running from previous projects and it's what I'm most experienced with, but how terrible would it be if I just fetched images from disk instead? Are there some other database system I can use that's more suited for the task than a lot of blobs in mysql? Keep in mind it's being set up on a windows server.

This thread seems pretty dead, but I'll take my chances and ask anyway.I'm in a big dilemma right now. Basically I have been working at this place for 5 years and it's sort of my first "real" job after graduating. But the thing is, this place has nothing to do with web dev or IT at all. I'm in charge for the site/advertisements/photography, but I'm learning absolutely nothing here. It's like I'm fresh out of school. The work conditions and people I work with are below average. I hate it here.But to get to the point, I have found a job offer that is really really interesting. It's sort of a big name (in a way) in my country and the offer looks really decent. I don't know or have everything they ask, but I think I can handle it with some help. It would definitely open up more possibilities.I have finished updating my resume and writing my cover letter, but I'm just so scared of this one specific question. "What do you do in your free time?" The job offer mentioned that you should be living a second life online and always be aware of new technologies and stuff. I do read about web dev semi-frequently, but I have no energy or motivation at all to work on anything at the end of my days, so I'm horribly out of practice.Should I apply anyway and take my chances and but with a reasonable chance of not landing the job, or should I wait a little more, force myself to practice things and apply at a later date when I feel more confident, but risking that the position will be filled?Sorry for the long post.
See There is little point in TS, when you can just use the official ES6 standard with Babel.
I want to know too
A few people have asked me to build websites for them. What kind of deployment or hosting system should I use?  Should I leave hosting up to them?  And what about CMS?  Just basically, real-world tips on doing web design
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5818003/stop-a-gif-animation-onload-on-mouseover-start-the-activationSave 2 seperate pictures, one animated and one static. Use jQuery to change the img's src on hover event.$( document ).ready(function() {    $("img").hover(        function()        { $(this).attr("src", "image.gif"); },        function()        { $(this).attr("src", "static.png"); });});You can also use mouseenter() and mouseleave() but hover() binds handlers for both of them.
I'd just say folders. Windows is known to have vastly slower disk I/O than Linux, but you can try. CSS animations, Javascript animations, swapping a background image for a GIF, canvas, scripted SVG. Any of the above triggered on the mouseover event will do the job.
Webstorm will let you leave a world of pain
Use bootstrap or some other framework and learn SCSS or LESSHave a look at the Symfony or Laravel frameworks. It allows you to develop enterprise grade applications in php. Which still is the biggest player in the webdev world.Also all of you have a look at Vagrant. It allows you to have great, easy to replicate, server/dev environments.
If you are a linux wizard of sorts you should really check out docker on a vps you bought. It will let you have multiple isolated hosting environments on a single server. Php,apache,nginx,mongodb,mysql, whatever. And you can also easily run these environments on your local pc/laptop to do some developing. I would try to avoid shared hosting. Its expensive in the long run and leaves you no freedom. A selfbuilt server environment allows you to do whatever you want. Even install cpanel if you are that kind of a guy/gal.
Apply. Obviously. You can grow really fast in webdev. Also, getting turned down doesnt hurt. Really. It happened to me a few times and I still live.

Threads only dead in early morning in North America. Pretty active in the evening.If I was in your position, I would browse some new technologies and get familiar with them. Not necessarily become a master, but understand what they do and how they can be used. I would apply when I feel more confident, unless it is a junior development position
The thing is my mentality though. If I'm being critical for myself, and think from the employer's POV, why would they hire someone that doesn't put in the effort to practice in his free time. It's supposed to be his "passion", right? There are also 17 other people (that I know of) that have applied too. So chances are very slim.I'm sort of up to date about most new technologies, I mean, I know about them, I just don't actually know them. I think the job is fairly intro level though.I'd link the offer but it's not in English.
Fair enough. What are they looking for? Most junior development jobs dont require too much out of you. They dont expect you to have 3+ years of experience with a bunch of different technologies

Well I don't really wanna have my own server, I use homestead for dev environment atm.  I'm just asking like, when building a website for people who have no idea with computers, how s the most hassle-free way to do it?  (for examples, one i'm doing is just a College society page and the other is an online shop for paintings)
It seems fairly straight forward. If you are unfamiliar with some of the technologies they want you to use, start to read up on what they are. Apply anyway, since it cant hurt, and the position could be filled soon depending on what city you are in
Alright, thanks. It feels like I'll be mostly doing newsletters and stuff, but it should be better than my current job at least.
Even if its boring, its at least relevant job experience, which can help if you apply to other jobs later. If you are just starting out in the web dev business, you dont have to know everything.Are you doing frontend or backend? What technologies do you know at the moment?
SASS vs LESS

I'm not sure which one suits me more yet,  to be honest. I only know HTML5/CSS3 with a very tiny bit of Javascript and some Bootstrap
Angular question:I have routing setup, and within one of my template urls, there is a directive in the form of an element.How do I define this directive?Some code to show the issue:Within the routing:when('/', {                    templateUrl: 'Directives/main.html',                    controller: 'mainConroller'                }).main.htmlbla bla bla, I'm a template controlled by mainController<undefined-element></undefined-element>^ where do I put his definition? ^How do I define undefined element without just lumping it in with the main
If you are a creative person, and like making interfaces, go frontend. Very fun, but tedious if you dont have a creative drive.If you like processing data and connecting people together, try out backend. It has its ups and downs, but its pretty fun.I originally started frontend, and now I am going backend. I eventually want to go fullstack (thanks to Node.js), but I am not as creative as I wish I could be
I think I'm similar to you in that regard. I don't find myself to be the most creative person either. I'm good at knowing which or what looks good or what could be improved, but coming up with original things from scratch is probably not my strongest point. I think I should just try some things and decide where to go from there.
You never know until you try. Start with whatever you feel you would enjoy at the moment, there isnt a rush.If you are familiar with Javascript, then frontend is already familiar. My technologies were Jade (HTML template language, made life a lot easier), Sass (CSS preprocessor), and Gulp (task automater). This took me about a day or two to learn, and it made life a lot easier. Gulp would compile my Jade/Sass into Html/Css, and remove any line breaks to make smaller files. It would also take all of my JS files, condense them into 1 file and remove any linebreaks, also making it smaller. I also started with Foundation as a starting framework, then moved onto Pure, since I was only using Foundations grid.If you wanted to start backend, try out Node.js with Express framework. Its a Javascript backend technology, and its pretty fun. A lot of people will tell you its awful, but honestly, everyone will tell you anything is awful
Maybe not web-related but, is Android development profitable? I was thinking of checking out either native dev or Xamarin, because I learn some C# for ASP.NET.
Awesome, thanks for the detailed explanation. I will focus on Sass/Gulp/Git first. I've been trying out Skeleton grid over Bootstrap since it looked pretty good. I'll take a look at Foundation as well.
No idea. If you create apps for yourself it's probably hit and miss.  If you create apps for others you probably get a stable income.I'm making a website for myself and my business partner already started claiming we needed an android app. With just the content of our site on that app so people can read it offline. Surely people are willing to pay 1 dollar for the exact same shit as on our website. That's how business people think. Getting work from such clients is almost free money.
No problem man. Im usually in these threads every day, so I can usually answer any questions you might have about frontend, but there are some others in here too that will help.There is 2 types of Sass as well. Whitespace Sass, and then there is Scss, which is closer to regular CSS. They both compile the same way, but I preferred to use whitespace since it used a hell of a lot less lines to write something. Look into Jade as well if you are going whitespace Sass. Ive recommended it to people irl and on here and it helps a lot.Make sure to have fun
I want to write a realtime chatwebapp, but the only backend I know is PHP. I think node.js is the right way, right? How hard is it to get started with that?
Since you have an embedded systems background, I'm assuming that you are interested in server side development, so you can interact with a device over the internet or something like that, am I right?In that case I would suggest staying away from things like php, and try out things like http://flask.pocoo.org/, webpy, python-eve,  or even nodejs.
With PHP, you can do it with web sockets, but I am not familiar with PHP so I cant help you there.With Node.js, you can use Socket.io/Express/MongoDB and create a pretty simple one in no time.But try to find a web socket for PHP before you go to another language, unless you are familiar with Javascript
I've read some stuff about websockets in PHP, but I always felt like PHP is some kind of tank that runs through it's code once and it's done.
Indeed. I was thinking of checking Android out but I'm so poor that my mobile phone is a 2005 model. I hope there are some good VM's out there.
Well, in Node its pretty straight forward. In fant, the tutorial for Socket.io is a real time chat application. Try out Node.js with Express, but make sure you at least know a bit of Javascript, otherwise you will have a tough time
The thing about Angular is that version 2 is wildly different compared to the first one, plus React is actually USED by Facebook.I hate Facebook with passion but the fact they did this is amazing.
is Django the best way to build a website with python?
What frameworks and toolchains should you learn if you are set on Java?Currently, I am developing locally in Eclipse with Maven, try stuff out on the Eclipse integrated Tomcat and upload the finished .war on my server, which is fronted by Apache2 (Reverse Proxy).
Its one of the most popular frameworks for Python. Look into Flask as well. Its all up to your personal preference, but have a look around
which of the two is easier to set up?
Ive only dabbled a bit into them, but I found Flask to be pretty easy
So.. does one of you have experience with PHP websockets? What library am I supposed to use?
Doesn't matter, just pick one.
Django is more full featured. It has everything and the kitchen sink. Flask, bottle, etc are more lightweight but you'll have to bring in 3rd party modules to do stuff.It all depends on what you want to do.
Everyone is fucking dead on the IRC
You can develop in java if you use asp.net

vagrant/homestead is a good environment
I am currently working/learning at a company that mainly uses PHP.I try to learn as much as possible out of here but my boss pretty much dismisses anything that I suggest we should use to improve our working conditions (e.g. using a version constrol like git, "we shall use oral communication and our brain not to mess up with the files we upload"). His arguments are pretty much always the same: "in theory everything sounds nice but in practice these do not work".Each of our scripts is literally worth hundreds of lines of PHP code generating "dynamic" Javascript, HTML and CSS (e.g. echo <script...).I am not allowed/cannot use any object orientation because my boss never learned this.Any suggestions how I could persuade him into working a little more professional?
git a new job
Bosses are typically stubborn and wont change even with facts presented. I suggest applying to a few jobs and try to leave asap.>"in theory everything sounds nice but in practice these do not workI dont know why he thinks version control is like Communism, but if he doesnt start using it soon, you will probably have a disaster happening soon
You have to talk $$$- show him how git or any other source control management tool can increase productivity and therefore increase revenue- show him how splitting those gigantic files increases modularity and helps the product gain flexibility and eases changing stuff up

What the fucking fuck? I've been a web developer for a couple of years now and I've never heard of anything that stupid. I get it that governmental entities need to generate html on the server to serve content for everyone but what the actual fucking fuck is that? At least get some sort of a template system going and separate that JS from everything else. The lack of Git or other VCS is also very disturbing.
>set up a more efficient version behind his back>show it to boss>show him how much the site has improved with your alterations and how much easier it is to implement.enjoy your raise
I am bound to this place for a little less than a year more by contract. I am already planning to leave.We already have huge problems with maintaining all projects (we are at PHP 5.2 and don't plan to ever upgrade). I secretely installed git for myself to easen my job without my boss consent. Still I need to use file diff tools to avoid overriding changes that have been done on the live system.I try to show him/ tell him everytime when a mistake happen, with which tool/programming concept we could have prevented this.That's what my problem is about...Did I mention documentation? Yeah, I did.. there is none so nothing to mention about it.I know I am at a lost position.. sigh just had to get this out..Anyone else has similar experience?
Is there a reason everyone in these threads recommends Socket.io and not SockJS? Can't find an up to date comparison. I've heard about Ratchet, but have never used it. Use an analogy. Software development without version control is like having a dozen people edit the same Word document without "undo". But judging by what you've said, he's retarded.
I'm the anon that posted this  a few days ago. I found out why I didn't get further than I expected...the pdf I was sent had TWO FUCKING PAGES! There was a mockup at the bottom that i didn't see...
Shitty. Just do what you can to make it easier on yourself. Maybe if you can get some of your coworkers into version control, then they can help persuade your boss
I think a lot of people recommend Socket.io because of its ease, but I havent used SockJS to do a comparison.
Seems backwards. Can you not Ajax in the responses you need from the back end and just use the php to do back end? It seems silly to send back lines of javascript.
Sucks, so you wasted a few hours? At least ur post make me laugh :^)
Killer man. I feel the frustration. It's going to be okay though, there are tons of jobs out there.

Our backend IS the frontend.I was ridiculed to mention a seperation from frontend and backend.For new projects/stuff only I am working on I try to apply these stuff, but currently we are only debugging existing code. Rewriting it is not allowed as it takes too much time and it just has to work.
Yeh i'm not too hung up on it. I just really really wanted the opportunity of an interview, i thought that would benefit me so much even if i didn't get the job.Ahh well, I learned some new stuff about checkboxes and the google maps api. Onwards and upwards!
Yeah, it sounds like you were eager to prove yourself and impress them. I think we all want to be respected for what we do. It's a real blow to the pride to make a misstep as small as that. Live and learnNever in all of my one year of experience have I heard of that. I hope I never have to deal with that.
>knowledge of JavaScript is a plusJesus Christ. There's your flag right there that this is an entry-level position.Also note that they never listed any frameworks or libraries.Fuck it. Apply today.
>Babelthanks dude, it's just like how i was using typescript anyway... i was using typescript in eclipse with the nodeclipse plugin, but still transpiling the typescript to javascript using command line TSC, and using a makefile to do the rest. this is just what i need, a command line transpiler, thanks a ton
Yeah I think so too, but even that would probably be better for me than my current job. I'm gonna wrap up a few things and then I'll apply.The fact that they use "Webmaster" as their function title instead of "Front-End Developer" is also a red flag to me. But again, I should probably just do this, even if it's just to get the experience on my resume.
Seriously don't even argue with him. Just use their shit workflow and keep your head down while you look for another job behind his back.
What is a beginner level thing to create for a noob in backend? I just need something simple that is fun, and then I can add onto it later

php question: There is this CMS for an image gallery, but whenever I change the images it doesn't seem to change it on the browser until the cache is cleared. So anyone who has visited the site before can't see the new replaced image. How can I resolve this issue? I'm doing maintenance on a site, is there a way to force the cache to clear for users? Or is there a way to make images not be saved to the cache?
Wow, how could I just learn this now after 7 years here.Try header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate");

How do you change the background color of a webpage using custom CSS?I'm using firefox. I have setup the correct directories/files (userContent.css).I'm testing with: https://docs.python.org/3/Attempt 1: Only the outside edges are affected@-moz-document domain(python.org) {body {   background-color: grey !important;}Attempt 2: Only a slice on the top and bottom are affected@-moz-document domain(python.org) {div.related {  background-color: lightgrey !important;}div.document {  background-color: grey !important;}}After doing some reading it appears that the background color is not inherited from its parent. So that would explain why the 'body' didn't work. But why didn't div.document work, when div.related did work?My eyes have really been hurting while trying to read bright pages. So, that is why I'm messing with this. Thanks.
idk, if the div doesn't have a class document, it won't apply to anything.

Is a vps much harder to maintain than a webhost?I'm thinking of upgrading to a vps to run multiple sites on. But I've got no idea what I'm in for. Especially regarding security.At first glance it looks pretty sttaight forward. Install server software and connect the ports.And my only experience with Linux is installing Mint on a laptop.
*connect the ip's
I can't see why you'd have anything other than a Mac if you're a developer especially if you're targeting the 3 major platforms. OS X can handle anything POSIX so whatever is running on GNU should work here as well as some BSD/Solaris stuff (D-trace, zfs, et al), in addition to that whatever you write on it should work fine on other POSIX compliant systems so long as you're not using OS X specific libraries etc. since it's just another Unix.Hardware wise their alright but more importantly the warranty plans are unmatched, you can just walk into any Apple store anywhere with your broken machine and walk out with a new one.Where's do I pick up my shillings?
Me. TypeScript > ES6 because it's statically typed. Until 98% of the browser support ES6 you will need a cross-compiler anyway, so you might as well use the more powerful one.
>is Android development profitable?Contract are profitable. Pushing your own apps now so much unless you know how to market them. Games are even harder.
You can google pretty much anything. Go for it, but stay away from Youtube and blogs with more CSS than text. You see, it's not actually statically typed. It just has some compile time type checking, which relies on community-maintained definition files for libraries (often incomplete). You also won't be able to just drop the compiler and use the much faster native functionality, when ES6 is mainstream. Neither will can you slowly disable the transformers one by one, if you only target the up to date browsers.
You can apply your webdev skill to make a Cordova app for Android. You don't need a phone for this.
>You see, it's not actually statically typed. It just has some compile time type checking>not actually statically typed>just has some compile time type checkingCompile-time (pre-execution) type checking is the definition of static typing. Seriously, look it up. How do you even define "static typing" if not like that?>It just has some compile time type checking, which relies on community-maintained definition files for libraries (often incomplete).Only for JS libraries. I am looking forward to using Angular 2.0, which is being developed in TypeScript. As Angular 2.0 gains users you can expect more TypeScript libraries to pop up.
TS is compiled to dynamically typed JS. No JS engine supports TS. My point is that, the end code that your engine interprets is not actually statically typed. If you only use TS libraries, I could see a point, but the few JS type definitions I've tried were quite bug ridden and incomplete.
What are good ways to work on projects on a live server in a group of 2 or 3 people, without overwriting changes?
git gud
>My point is that, the end code that your engine interprets is not actually statically typed.Okay, that's a more reasonable criticism. It would be nice to have the type system  available at runtime but  very few programming languages work like that (for complicated reasons). Even Java, the go-to example of a statically typed OO language, has type erasure in generics (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/erasure.html) and unsafe class generation. When debugging you can see the type information by using source maps, which works for me.>the few JS type definitions I've tried were quite bug ridden and incomplete.I had the same experience back when TS was pretty new  but  when I tried it once again in early in 2015 the definitions  were much better. On my current project I've run into one bug (a missing definition) in the dozen or so of Definitely Typed .d.ts files that I use. It is an issue but it's not as bad you might think. I kind of envy Dart for having type annotations from the start, thought its type system is worse.
I need your help /g/I do have a Teufel Concept E Magnum PE connected to a Asus Xonar DG soundcard, all 5 speakers and the sub work fine so far, but only when i connect the speakers solely.

FuckI was wondering why one of my hard drives wasn't showing up.
The causality, still under warranty too.
https://youtu.be/yNtySt6Fg30
>Burned stuff>WarrantyAHAHAHAahahahah
How did that happen
I mean it was under warranty. It was only 4 months old. I know I'm not getting a replacement.
Look like your cheap cables was the cause.
Have you tried turning it off and back on again?:P
I'm guessing a shitty modular SATA power cable.If I were to take that guess a step further, I'd say Corsair.
I'm assuming it was my power supply. Everything else was fine except that one hard drive. Not taking any chances though. The fucking sata power connector turned to ash when I touched it.
 Not modular and antec. It was my media server.
Holy shit it still works! I just mounted it after cleaning it all off.

well, while, I would also advise him to not trust this drives reliability, at least he can get all the information off of it before tossing it. not a total loss.
you could easily open that up and solder the power connector to it, it only uses like 5 pins on the wire and on the inside.but i would guess the drive is cooked on the inside. if there's no important data on it without backup then go ahead and return it.
The problem here is not asus, it's AMD
I've had this happen before, the pins melted but I cleaned that shit out and sandpaper it and it worked, since it was still barely making contact.
My brother's friend's ASUS motherboard once caught fire while he was playing WoW with a few friends a few years ago. It was fucking hilarious to watch.
No it's asus
That's a custom vrm assembly, so its definitely Asus's problem.
How does this even happenI've had dozens of PCs since the 80s and this never happened to me
>tfw asus motherboard
Asus mobo are pretty good if you get the right SKU.The TUF and ROG boards are pretty baller.That and the WS line.
that happened to my brother the one time he decided to do a hardware upgrade without meput sata power plug on backwards and it caught fire
I have an Asus too, republic of gamers. Its been serving me well, no issues.
>put sata power plug on backwards and it caught fireThis never happened
asus rampage formula going almost 7 years hereno complains other than one fried ethernet port (it happened after a very heavy thinderstorm) and inability to oc my c2d E8500 even by one MHz without the system crashing (not sure if it's the motherboard's fault or my incompetence)
>tfw every asus motherboard I ever ordered was DOAI'm not even making this shit up, why is asus so shit these days.
that's what you get trying to save a few bucks on a substandard psu OP
start using anti-static straps you dumb nigger
Yea that explains perfectly why the other motherboards, let alone every other piece of equipment, were perfectly fine.Dumbass.
Now you've jinxed yourself and the whole thing will light on fire and burn your house to the ground.But same here.
Never used one in my lifefeels good living in a high humidity environment.Only had 1 Asus motherboard my whole life and it's the only one having issues.It turns back off unless I turn the PSU off for a few secs and then boot it.
I can't fap to this, need to see face before I get hard
No  you're a fucking shilling retard
they started using mainland(RoC) suppliers rather than their old chain of Japanese/Taiwanese part makers
Electricity is power.  Power in the wrong places makes things hot.  Hot things start fires.

I still remember the days when AT&T had true unlimited. This was back in like 2009 (3G). But then, even if you were grandparented in, they slowed you down after 2.5GB
What carrier do YOU use?And explain the data how it works on yours. I bet they cap you in one way or another.
in my opinion any cap should be illegal by law they should have ot give you unlimited data with your cell plan
oh they cap me bvut its just a slow down after i use 4 gigs they dont actually raise my bill its still bullshit just not the same brand of bullshit

.hack is on a different plane for me compared to Accel World. both good in different ways. Log Horizon is up there as well, but I don't think it deserves as many "greater than"s as you gave it
>Will Nervegear-level direct-to-brain interfaces become a reality in our lifetimes?Probably not.
going back to this, dreams are sensations that the brain think are real to a point but aren't actually being sensed by any organs,so what can we make that make manipulate subconscious sensations?
Virtual reality you cannot duel wield in a game called sword fucking art online op is a shit for liking such a shitty anime and the shitty games that doesnt make sense.
Sort of. Directly interfacing with the brain is a dangerous game, though. One small short and you're gone, buddy. Although, full-body suits capable of stimulating nerves and muscles and such aren't that far off, really. And we already have machines that can scan brain waves and interface with hardware with just your brain (albeit slowly). So we're getting there.
you can't really compare log and .hack, they're just too... different.
log horizon wasn't as good as accel world, SAO or .hack.hack >accel world > SAO
Ressentiment got it right. In order to "feel" anything you need additional peripherals.

What are some good practices for securing an Ubuntu GNU/Linux server?Where do I go to learn basic security tips/practices?
Bump
install gentoo
Some basic security practices in my opinion would be using strong passwords, restricting root access, securing your ssh access, getting to know iptables and ofc knowing your system and it's configs. Also backing up stuff if it goes kaput and keeping shit updated. Most importantly use common sense.Your security setup also depends on what servers you're running and for what purpose (public, private use).
don't use password authentication via ssh and lock shit down with iptables..oh and get something like fail2ban working
Don't use Ubuntu to start, use a proper server distro.
XDDDD

ITT: We talk about how AI is going to be the downfall of the human race
AI won't be. AI will always be a tool that humans use to advance ourselvers.
it probably  won't tho
Only if we learn to control it before we perfect it
>Humanity>Correctly doing somethingkek
AI will be but that doesn't mean the end of human race. Though exterminate all humans is probably the most efficient way to deal with most of Earth environmental issues.

ITT: We talk about how the human race is going to be the downfall of the human race.
mate "save the planet" does not refer to the planetit refers to the living habitat that allows us, humans, to live.You completely missed the point.
I was referring to OP's "the downfall of human race"A lot of literature films, vidya etc. take for grant that if AI will come then humanity will fall to pieces. I don't think this passage is mandatory. Assuming the superintelligence of an AI the AI itself should understand that the human could be live in harmony with it's environment but this means to review and change a lot of ours mindset
By the way if you want to go deeper you should read some papers from the guys at MIRI the research about everything regarding AI's (even their hypothetical legal status and if they sould be considered legally as people)
It's the new lenovo y50. It has 960m instead of 860m and I cannot find any reports of 48Hz locked screen. Do you think I should get it? Also considering to buy 256GB SSD version.I want to use it mainly for school. I am 3D designer/I edit videos for fun. Should I go for the 4K version?
Shit battery. Useless for school
Why the fuck does the 960M get 4GB when the full version only gets 2?
If I Had to replace my similar 760m Asus laptop that was around the same price when I got it, I would consider it, I wouldn't get 4k on it though 1080p is fine for a 15in screen imo
It's a given that gaming laptops have poor battery life. You're better off getting a desktop PC + cheap, long-lasting laptop if you don't need portability.I see so many of these laptops at my own school and folks who use them are essentially enslaved to sockets.


So, I know sweet FA about graphics cards, and my 5 year old one is on it's way out - A Radeon 4850.Is it time to become an nVidiot, or stay an AMDouche?Pic related, literally the first one I clicked on at pccasegear.
AMD only has rebrands while Maxwell is the most recent architecture from Nvidia, widely praised for high performance and power efficiencyGTX 960 is also future proof with Direct3D 12 Feature level 12_1 support, 4K HEVC and 4K H.264 decoding, HDMI 2.0 support and variable refresh rate for gaming support, features that AMD don't have at that price range
Does really matter to be honest. Jewvidia is shilling GameWorks, while AMD has their own optimization bullshit. We're only a few years from having nvidia and amd exclusives.
Which was the one with the memory problems?
How much are you looking to spend?
GTX 970 which is $330 or so
Can this post read any more like an advertisement? shill go home
Nvidia:>Get the more architecturally advanced GTX960 or the faster, but more dated GTX970 or GTX980! Feel fucked either way.- or ->Shell out 1000 Americans for a noisy Titan X on a poorly cooled reference bodyAMD:>Shell out 600 George Washingtons for a GTX 295x2 and figure out where the fuck the water cooler is gonna go>Risk a housefire>Wait for disapponting 390x lineI'd say wait for AMD to release something next week and then decide. Nvidia is apparently releasing a 980 Ti much sooner than expected as well. Nvidia tends to be better from my experience because their drivers simply work better for the games I play, but their Hairworks bullshit and the fact that their more expensive models aren't linear stepups is annoying to me.
>GTX 970 which is $330 or soDo NOT get this. It is the most architecturally inferior of the 900 series and confines to you 1080p gaming. The fact that people tell you it doesn't need to use the extra 512 MB is irrelevant, because ONCE IT DOES START USING IT (and it will), you'll get frame stutter.
GTX 960 is the same architecture as the GTX 980/970Only thing it is more advanced in is the 4K HEVC hardware decoder
If you're only doing 1920x1080x60fps, a GTX 750Ti is enough.
Maybe for like BioshockNew games can't even do that with something like a 280X unless you're willing to tone down the details a fuckton
Fucking hell, the shills are out in full force to day.These are the only cards you should be considering:>GTX 980>R9 290X>R9 290>R9 280X>R9 285>R9 270>750ti (Only for HTPC builds, or if you have a crap PSU, otherwise get the 270.)Anything else is overpriced (960), or just pure shit (970). Try to avoid any post that talks about "advanced  features", or "superior experience" it's guaranteed to be a shill
"shill" is the new "edgy"
I considered AMD but goddamn why does it need so much power while performing the same as Nvidia cards?
AMD needs much more power while having less performance than Nvidia because of their outdated, obsolete GCN which is well known to be inefficient and power hungryA lot of AMD shills tells people to buy AMD because it's lower price but don't factor in PSU upgrade price.
The 390X will be a slightly overclocked 290X for twice the money. Don't bother. Raedon is shit for gaming, only good if you can't afford anything else.
>while having less performancestop being stupid
The 200 series is just a bit older and less efficiency, they where designed to compete with Nvidia's 700 series. Hopefully the new 300 series will fix this. They're still better value overall.
I consider a PSU upgrade and the higher electricity bill not a better value overall.
No GCN card is faster than Maxwell card at the same price point270X can't compete with GTX 960, you need a much more expensive and power hungry 285 to even be competitive290 is slower than GTX 970290X certainly can't compete with the GTX 980
http://videocardz.com/55659/leaked-driver-confirms-hawaii-rebrands-in-radeon-300-series300 series is nothing but 200 rebrands, enjoy your outdated GCN shit for more money
Where do you live anon? The all of those AMD cards are cheaper than their counterparts. You don't live in some sort of thirdworld county do you?
Aren't they coming out with a 960TI or is it a 970TI?
No. There where some rumours at the start of the year. But they where probably fake.
980ti will happen soon, it will be faster and cheaper than a titan x.
APUs are the future bro, only hardcore dorks put grafix cards in computers anymore
Amd is the best price to performance in  all categoriesthe exact same ammount of money will buy you an AMD card that is a full tier above its nvidia counterpartfor example the gtx 960 and the R9-290X are the same price and the 280x is hilariously more powerfull
>960>future proof>128bit bus with 2gb memory
I know nothing of graphic cards either: I was thinking about purchasing a r9 290, is now a wise time to purchase a new gpu or should I wait for a new series that drives prices down?
>960>Future proof
>AMD advertises maximum power draws on their cards>Nvidia advertises idle power draw>People actually believe AMD graphics cards are hotter, louder and more power hungryTop shekekels goy, it seems Nvoydia's marketing worked wonders.
>so much powerNot even that, I think they used a weird average of idle/load or something.
The 960 is a turd of a card.
The 970 is actually good. It trade blows with the 290x despite having the slight gimp in memory and it is within the price range.
R9 290 is generally the best card to buy right now for mid-high performance gaming. It is 85% the performance of a 980 for half the price. There is nothing really bad about it either if you buy one with a good reviewed cooling system.
>cut down titan x>somehow faster than a titan xare Nvidiots really this retarded?
When will we see new cards or should I just get a 970?
I'd wait for computex next week, see what AMD is gonna do, then decide. Otherwise the 290 is pretty much the best value/dollar at the moment.
You will get absolutely fucked in the coming years if you get a 970. The 3.5 GB flaw will really show with newer games that have better textures than now.
It's not like the 1070 will come with 6gb, will it?Do we have any news on this? Should I wait? I mean I know about the 970 that's why I still haven gotten one but I want to replace this 670 already and I cant afford a 980
the plan is to offer top tier performance at a consumer grade price, obviously there will be some compromises though
Best bang for buck out there is 290x, but the 390's are coming so I'd hold off.  Sure, the cards use a little more power, and might cost you a bit extra in a power supply, but it's really not even close from a price/performance perspective.
It is always good to wait when a new card comes out to see how it truly performs... It's already clear the 900 series are shit and no one anticipated that. Who knows, maybe the new series from AMD and Nvidia won't be shit, the only way we'll know is by waiting and avoiding the retarded fanboys until you see it yourself.
Also to answer your question completely no one really knows anything about the new cards until before early launch due to leaks or when it actually launched. If you're not running Linux then AMD is a viable option, wait for the 300 series and see how good they are. There is new technology coming out every 1 or 2 years that make previous technology obsolete, so it is always good to wait for something better than settle for something lesser now.
I'm definitely going to wait then. I just didn't know how far are we in the cycle for new hardware.Cheers.

you are probably banned for being a shitposter
Buy a 4chan pass or get a different ISP.  Rangebans are done because your ISP is full of abusive fucks and spammers.
I don't even post on /mu/. This is the first time I've tried to make a thread there in months.I also reset my router, cleaned cookies and tried again. Then I tried a VPN cleaned cookies and tried again. I tried private browsing as well. I just don't know what the fuck is going on.

Anything sensitive shouldn't be kept anywhere near your computer.All sensitive information should be placed onto a USB, and then encrypted using GPG. This USB should be cloned to another USB, to use as a backup if needed.These USBs should then be placed into an airtight container and buried. You should only dig them up when absolutely needed, and rebury them as soon as you're done with them.When working with these USBs, you should ONLY boot into a live distro using a CD that's kept with your USBs.
Also pedos participate in this thread. Degenerates.
What's wrong with being pedo?
you get docked points for vacumming other men
What?
There is only one good defense.>offense
It's immoral and illegal. Ultimate degeneracy mental illness.
Actually, being a pedo is not illegal. The immorality part is very debatable; I for one don't think that a sexual preference can be immoral.>mental illnessAlright, but if pedos are mentally ill, then so are gays.
Do any of you fags know an IRC client that supports SOCKS?
Pedo pls go
Don't start shit if you can't finish it.
you know what i said
Seek councilling, pedo scum.
I have guns too, but you're going to lose against a SWAT team, one way or another. It's much better to have your shit covered up so that you won't have to start shooting.The same in English, please.Why?
motherucker i speak english you're just too much draugr too drop the trophies
Because you have a mental illness. We've gone over this, cuck.
>that sbr on the bottomwow that got me hard
A draugr, honey?Yeah, well, the gays are mentally ill too, but they seem to do just fine in modern society.
OP here, the faggotry seems to be balanced in this thread.>encrypting OMG PEDOTheyre many different reasons to encrypt your shit. infringement for one. You can't tell me companies don't encrypt their drives to protect intellectual property.
The gays don't have a reputation for hurting children, do they.
Literally any IRC client ever. mIrc for example.
So because they have a poor reputation, they're mentally ill? Must I remind you that we're not discussing rape, we're discussing the preference.

That sounds unpleasant. I can assure you though that I am not a draugr.

So, is truecrypt still good?
My fucking god, this guy will argue that being a pedo is fine until he dies.
>not having a can of thermite sitting on top of your HDD bayIt's like you want to get caught.
So what's wrong with it?
AMD is an illegal chip made by communists to subvert confidence in american tech comanies and only hackers use it
Usually takes a crane to get them out.
I use a python script that polls a certain USB port. If there is anything happening on that port, the machine instantly powers off.My harddrive is also fully encrypted with dm-crypt+LUKS using the default settings.In the USB ports I have a flash drive that I attach to my wrist using a strap. If someone pulls the laptop away from me, they have about 0.2 seconds to throw the thing into liquid nitrogen and have the memory cool down enough to stop the process.I don't store anything sensitive on there. In fact I just use this machine for shitposting and wardriving which is why I don't care too much about the encryption strength of my harddrive.I just want to annoy the fucko-squad :^)
I really appreciate the illustration.
Am I still being tracked and stuff if I'm non-American?
Probably.
Most definitely.
I live in the Philippines.I mean, it's American influenced right but, I guess I should worry.What country respects your privacy the most?
Philippines is a country that doesn't mean shit in the world politics and economy, so fortunately you don't really have to worry.

How good is Android 5.1 encryption? How secure is it and does it slow down the phone much?
Kinda this. No squad is going to bust your door down once they figured out you downloaded Mall Cop™ 2Flash storage buried somewhere

>mom opens door to tell you hot pockets are ready>fries hard drives>fries balls

especially then. I thought NSA is powering down it's US surveillance, but just continuing its normal surveillance. Also local gov't is probably spying on you. and me. yay. Goedemiddag, AIVD.
>pedos defending their degenerate ways.
where do you draw the line between personal/personal enough to be buried?

So how good is OS X's FileVault2?
>price reduced right after the apple watch release>mfw 150$what do you say /g/? is it worth it?
That black cut-off at the bottom makes it not worth a $150. You can buy a good watch with that money.
Not really. Only reason I would ever get one would be for tracking macros and fitness, and even then I wouldn't get that one for that because it's too fancy. I could easily just get a sports band that has enough battery to last a year.
If you have $150 to spend on something like that then sure. I put a goldeneye skin on mine. It was aweosme. Mine was crushed by a 105mm HE round but I plan to buy another.
How does running stuff at 1440p on a 4k TV work out in terms of image quality? Obviously native 4k is best but 1440p is more within the reach of most peoples PCs.

>that timerthis material stuff is getting retarded
After living in San Francisco for ~3 years, balls deep in the startup scene, and rubbing elbows with the most batshit of SJWs (I even met Adria Richards before she did donglegate thing) - I'm 100% convinced that maybe a good 5% of people in this industry are hardcore autists/sperglords/insane SJWs who do nothing but piss each other off due their complete lack of ability to handle being around other people in social situations. These 5% of people are the reason Google has to employ shit like this, or else you get some autist say something stupid to some woman, or some SJW overhear a joke and for the next 2,3 months all that is mentioned by your company/conference is how some asshat said X and because it was done at the conference the whole company, including the CEO is now racist/sexist/ableist/tumblrist/what ever the hip-ist-is these days-ist.

Hey /g/, what's a cheap mouse that I can get that's still decent or serviceable quality? I know almost nothing about mice, but I was thinking about going with something simple such as http://www.amazon.ca/Microsoft-Optical-Mouse-Hardware-Black/dp/B003FOWIXK/ref=sr_1_6?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1432814523&sr=1-6&keywords=mouse. MUH FEECHURS doesn't matter so much as having a solid mouse that won't break in a month.
Logitech G400.Perfect mouse, I sometimes borrow my brother's DeathAdder 2013. Eh, don't really like it, feels odd even with the same dpi setting.
>Logitech G400It's a nice mouse, but far too expensive. I was thinking something less than 50$.
You could pick up a raptor m45 for like $40
Unfortunately it's 65$ + 10$ shipping on Amazon.ca. You will never know the pain of living in Canada and having prices be 30% more for the same damn thing.
Shop around more, dingus.I found a Roccat Kone Pure Cringetary edition for $40 on NCIX a few months back.
I got if for $30.Shop around more.
I hate shopping for mice. There's not a single brand I feel like I can trust when it comes to durability.
I will look around, of course, but I don't have a huge amount of time to spend scouring every site for lower prices. As I said, I'm new to mice, so I really just want something entry level that's fairly cheap and will last. That said, I'll look around for deals on stuff that's been mentioned already.

Have been looking around online for a while now, I thought this would have to be the best place to get some good advice.Want something slim with a decent screen that can be used for (filthy) casual gaming and wont be too loud.Really not interested in anything apple.Would get a gaming PC but need to be mobile.pic fucking fantastic
kill yourself then you wont need a laptop
Gaming pc or laptop, never both
See if you can get a current gen Macbook air for around $700, hard, but possible.Else, dell xps 13 or whatever that one is.
So I'm guessing if I have to travel then I should just not game while away or just kill myself?
>macbook air>gamingTOP KEK
I've been looking for something similar, except not for gaming. As far as I can tell, the best option is the Dell xps 13. It can even manage casual games.
Find me something better for the price. Because of the cooling it even shits on the MBP.It gets the job done. And no, fuck you, you can put the graphics on low. If you want something pretty switch to your desktop. If you wanna have some fun on a laptop it doesn't fucking matter, you're on a cunting laptop.
For casual gaming any laptop with a discrete GPU will do the job, and you'll stay under 700€. If you can reach 1000€ then there are a lot of good PCs waiting for you, fullHD screens, good materials...

I have a modern system, so 8 GB of ram is nothing to me. As long as it's freed up when I close the browser.

Is there any app for free marvel or DC comics
Clover is much better imho
plenty of torrent clients
Problem I don't which to download first never read a comic my whole life
Should ask /co/ for suggestion of good arcs then, I also don't know shit about marvel/dc comics
Why no recomendations
I don't really have secret cool apps
Zanti is fun to mess around with, not sure how sekrit club is it though.
Overchan is amazing. Just wish it had a couple more features, but it's good enough for me that I don't ever use clover anymore
Any good app to transfer stuff over wifi?
this
>have Drastic on OPO>works fine>system update>install it>Drastic has stopped workingThanks, you fucks. Can recommend though, it played Pokeymans B/W just fine, granted that you can start the app in the first place though.
Just get anything that does FTP, I think some file managers come with it.Pop filezilla on your PC and voila.
Am on Clover right now, my only complaint is when you make a thread, it isn't automatically pinned.
I use Droid Over Wifi. Good app. I wish there was something as simple to mirror my SMSs. No connection to the internet at all, just the local network to retrieve your messages from the cellphone and send.
Greenify for managing background appsIngress is a fun game for people who like to run or bike

That looks a lot like the pcs+ cooler. Is zotac and powercolor partners or something?Wish it came without the liquid cooling tho.
Pascal cards will have short PCB because the HBM2 memory is next to the GPUThere won't be any long PCB cards in the future
Sadly though, i hate the look of small cards. But then, maybe the chip itself might grow once we hit silicon fabrication limits. Or there will be more cards with two chips once multi GPU setups get better.

HAPPENING??!!!!!>iPad with integrated Wacom>Will finally be able to enjoy the Procreate app>Won't have to settle for 3rd party shit with fat rubber tips, discs, or jittery 'fine tip' solutions with AAAAAAA batteries>Won't have to settle for Surface Pro with shitty N-Trig>Won't have to settle for expensive Cintiq Companion with noisy fan and shit battery life>Won't have to settle for bulky old ThinkPad>Won't have to settle for Android tablets with their shit art appsPlease don't fuck this up
you know when you touch a TFT it makes these funny colours, what about pic related?
Wasn't the original idea to not have to use such a pen? Am I missing something here?
some people like to drawdigital art is a thing
But... Wacom already offers styluses for iPads, and not shitty ones either.http://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/stylus/intuos-creative-stylus-2But I guess this is Apple's thing, release something that already exists, then claim it is new and revolutionary.
If I can use this as a draw pad, I may order one.However, it'll have to compete with the Cintiq 13HD, in that the Cintiq also doubled as a small 1080p screen which is handy for extra things when your gaymen is fullscreen on my triple monitor setup.
A way you could convince people to do this is to have them use the bottom of a battery on their touch screen (which actually does work). Just say because the surface area is smaller you need to press harder with a pen.
I don't even want to know the price
Are you a retard?
I'm sure Apple is very eager to pander to teenagers who want to draw their favorite anime character.
Who cares? They will kill surface with it and claim it was a revolutionary idea.
source?
No, are you?>Wacom technology built inThis could mean fucking anything, and from the deliberate avoidance of the word digitizer I'm inclined to believe it's just an iPad with this pen prepacked with it.
Fuck you this drawing tablet will cost 1700€ minimum. Apple + Wacom are you fucking kidding me. It will kill nothing.
I'm thinking it's probably Wacom's new active ES technology.The traditional EMR tech would require the iPad to be fatter, no?
Why is everyone treating this as a fact? Did I miss something?
typical apple rumour shit
Surface already costs 1200$ for a decent one +150 for a cover. And it's by MS, not Apple.Surface will retain US businessman who wants to fly with a laptop  market, but artists will be lost forever, you know how they are.
It's not real.The person did an OK job at replicating Apple's style though. Wrong font, shit looking image, non-apple sounding captions.
Image is fake, but rumors about iPad pro with a stylus has been around for a few month already.
Surface 3s are shit for artists since it uses N-trig instead of an active digitizer. You can buy Surface Pro 2s on eBay in pretty good condition for $500 these days.
jobs died
but why would you use a shitty ipad for it? why wouldn't you get something nicer?
and apple has been tanking downhill ever sincethat man kept apple in line and actually had standards RIP
>N-trig instead of an active digitizerdoes this mean anything besides buzzwords?
Surface 2 is heavy and bulky with an active fan, it's like MS wants to be overtaken by Apple.
Panasonic MX notebook shits ot everything apple has to offer.
Remember! Steve Jobs was the sole innovator, marketer, designer, product reviewer and tester at apple. Literally no-one else worked there before he died
N-trig is a lot better than Wacom penabled in my experience.Stop falling for Wacom's Industry standard bullshit.Although, if it does indeed use Wacom's newer battery powered digitzer, the Microsoft should be worried.
something nicer doesn't exist. Every portable digital art option has some kind of deal breaking flaw. Refer to OP
My understanding is that active = battery poweredN-Trig is battery poweredWacom EMR works by induction, no battery needed. Maybe it's considered active in some other way, or maybe anon is getting his terminology confused
Cintiq Companion Hybrid
>android>not even latest version of android>bulky and heavy>no good art apps>not enough power
All my digital art applications run on Windows, not shitty IOS, so this thing does jack shit for me.
Of course there's no software for you on iOS. Developers aren't even aware that this device is coming, so they can port their apps. If this is actually real, every app you need will be ported within 6 months of release.
SP already works with osx.the pen works too.
Lol killing surface will take more than a fucking itoy at this point where it has won millions of peoples confidence. Everybody knows ipad and ishits are all facebook machines

Can we have a shaving technology thread?Why are you still using shitty cartridge shaving systems, when you can get a better shave from double edge razors that cost only $0.10 a blade?
inhibiting your glorious guru beard is the exact opposite of the /g/ spirit
>using anything other than an electric razorFuck off back to hipsterville faggot.
Safety razors are a better buy for a lot of people.I don't let the beard grow, but if it did, it would be curly. A razor that I can't simply snap open and rinse out every few strokes, would clog constantly. I can't practically shave using normal ones.Some people only want tech they can buy in a big box store. Their loss.
But electric razors are the better modern options. Cartridge systems are the worst of both worlds.
I use a foil shaver that cleans itself and I roll my own cleaning solution.
Astras or Feathers?Why are feathers 3 times as expensive?
>clogging it up and having it painfully yank 50 years out at the same timeNo thanks.Straight razor master race.
I've tried everything, and have settled on a double edge razor.I enjoy shaving soap and real shaving cream and a badger brush, etc.My favorite blades are Personna or Feather blades.
Master race coming through
Why not get clippers and never have to buy razors or haircuts again?
I use a pair of nail scissors to trim my facial hair every now and then. I'm 22 years old.What the fuck is wrong with me?
My boyfriend uses this on his head. Are the six blade cartridges worth it.
I spend like 20 minutes doing 3 passes on my face and it still looks like I haven't shaved. Fuck everything.
Because clippers don't shave close enough. Far from it, in fact
>be black>don't need to shave because that's racist
I'll remember that the next time I don't want to be a man.
holy shit this thing is insane
He also has crow's feet and wimpy eyebrows like that guy.
why buy into a restrictive ecosystem that forces you to regularly buy more replacement blades when you could buy one straight razor that will last for decades, with proper care?
I've thought about it but I don't know if I want to spend time stropping it, what's your average shave take you time wise? Maybe it's not as bad as I think.
>restrictive ecosystem>10 cent bladesNot everyone makes a ritual out of their shaving routine, grampa.
Because a safety razor is easy to use.
>fill sink with hot water>wash face >apply shaving gel (I use canned stuff, don't see the point in bothering with a brush and cream)>shave, rinse blade every few strokes>apply gel again>shave in opposite direction (blade going towards top of head instead of towards feet)>rinse face>clean blade>strop (takes maybe 20 seconds)>clean counterwhole thing takes about 20 minutes if I'm relaxing and taking my time. I know most of /g/ will laugh at this but I like to use shaving as a meditation/zen time where I can just zone out with one simple task and zero distractions. if I'm hurrying, whole thing might take 10 minutes.good job recognizing mild hyperboleso is a straight razor if you're not a drooling retard. I started shaving with one when I was 16, never had a cut worse than a papercut. it just requires that you pay attention to what you're doing.
That sounds exactly like what I do now and the same time but better, maybe I will get one of these.>I know most of /g/ will laugh at this but I like to use shaving as a meditation/zen time where I can just zone out with one simple task and zero distractions.Even this, it's almost like a bonzai tree but it's your face, I always enjoy it.
I laugh at all you losers who spend 10 minutes "hydrating" their beards and applying soap with a unicorn hair brush.Shaving in the shower master race.
>not using an epilator or getting electrolysisPig disgusting. Facial hair is gross.
forgot pic
How do you avoid ripping your skin off?
You can't do that with facial hair, and hasn't electrolysis been superseded by lasers?
By having a good epilator? It's never been an issue for me so I don't know.
>/lgbt/
sweet, definitely look into it if you're interested. I've only owned the one razor and it was a gift, so I can't give any recommendations for a specific razor, but barbers/hairstylists are pretty knowledgeable about the subject, in my experience.>Even this, it's almost like a bonzai tree but it's your face, I always enjoy it.Yes, exactly. I grew out my facial hair a while back and I miss that feeling. It's hard as fuck to trim/style with a straight razor because they're so long.
Yes you can, there are epilators for the face.Laser is like 70-90% reduction IF you're pale with dark hair otherwise it doesn't really work at all but it is cheaper and faster. Electrolysis is 99.9% removal.
Derby extra master race reporting. Use these with a merkur HD slant edge. 100 pack of blades for 19 AUD delivered. Crazy not to.
Derbys are dull as fuck.Feather master race.
Have fun cutting the shit out of your face and spending twice as long to shave everytime.There's a good reason people don't use straight razors anymore - they fucking suck.
anon, those are safety razors
How do people even cut themselves with safety razors?I can't draw blood even with feather blades.
Straight razor, safety razor, they're both shit.I can't believe you guys fell for the single blade meme.
Enjoy your $5 cartridges, retard.
I agree, however I found the feathers to be too sharp. The Derby's cut just fine without being too aggressive.
kek I didn't know it was possible to be this deludedenjoy your $5, one-use razors and your skin irritation
ayyy
I used one of these once.I've only ever cut myself shaving once in my life and it was with a disposible bic.Fuck those things.
Lol @ $5 cartridges, are you trying to spread lies?It's like $2 per catridge. Use one cartridge a month, it's $2 per month.If you can't afford $2 per month for a way better and faster shave, then you might be retarded.
>le beards are le manlyyy XXDDDDD bacon and beerFuck back to reddit
enjoy your skin irritationWhat's that?There's a little patch you missed?Press down as hard as you like, you can't shave it off with 5 blades in the way!
Are you 15?If you can get a cartridge to last you a whole month, you must not have very much hair at all.Go away.
>one cartridge a month
Enjoy spending 30 minutes a day shaving and cutting up your face, while mine looks perfect in 5 minutes using a multi-blade.
I actually go through maybe 1 cartridge every 2 months and I have a fast growing beard.The trick is to ignore that stupid color stripe and just keep shaving, it still works great.
Because they're made in Japan, where labor is expensive, instead of Russia, where labor is cheap.Feathers are definitely sharper, but I don't know if they're worth 3x the cost.
I spend 5 minutes shaving and it's in the shower.You sound underage, so I doubt your time is worth anything.
>perfect
I shave my head, and a cartridge is generally dull after one use, if that.  Head hair is fucking brutal on cheap razor blades.
Anyone here used the refurbishing service on razor emporium? if so, how did you like it?
>headmower
No matter what I've tried l always get a lot of ingrown hairs. I have really coarse and curly hair. I use a double edge safety razor low but I've tried an electric too. Any suggestions?
Try putting a laser to your face.
I hate the shitty fucking glue they put on astras.But I use the personna hospitals because they have more coating while still being sharp as fuck.
shave powder
I cut myself with electric shavers.
acid
Have you tried the derby platinum?
You must be retarded.Shaving in the shower?Do you piss in the shower too?Guaranteed I'm older than you, but more importantly much wiser.
Electric shaving will leave the hairs less sharp so they're less likely to poke back in.
But I trim my beard, not shave it off
I also fap in the shower, fight me.No mess, no fuss.You'd be stupid to shave anywhere else.
Don't shave against the grain. A sharper, more mild shave may work better. If you don't like the results you get from the double edge, have you tried bumpfighter? Also perhaps I wouldn't shave every day. Try every other day.I have problems with ingrowns too. I have way less problems than I used to. I use an adjustable safety razor and creamo cream. And my shaves are quick. Good on those 20 min guys but I got shit to do.
How long does a case of 100 blades last?
a year easy.
>using a razor on your headget a fucking hair clipper you fucking retard
I change a blade every 4-6 shaves or so depending on the brand and how long I wait between shaves, so use that as a rough estimate.
I have that exact razor on the left.
I've been using the same disposable razer for almost a year now. feels bad. pulls on the hair :(had to move in with parents cause going to school and I am terrible with humility to ask for a new razeranyone try the $1 shave club? I've been considering it, but idk about the quality
I have a fairly pricey Norelco.The thing will run for almost an hour before it dies, and I have been on the original heads since I bought it about 4 years ago.
Dollar shave just resells dorco stuff.  If you like it, you can get it cheaper direct from dorco, or just use amazon subscribe and save if you want the full dollar shave club experience.
A good double edge safety razor is cheaper in the long run...you can buy 100 blades for less than $10.
link to some guides?reading this thread and comparing to some cartridge:>pros:better shave for some?cheaper>contras:slowermore dangerousharder to buy
tytyI'll look into both for best quality/$shave on brotherine
sounds like an easy way to get fucking ingrown hairs dude...I've been using blades like on the right. why should I use a safety razor?
I cut myself more with a cartridge.  Have a mole on my jawline that cartridges and disposables love to hack away at, and the annoying thing is it will bleed for literally hours.  Haven't hit it once with my Merkur.  I think the sharpness of the blade helps.  It cuts the hair, it doesn't pull it and gouge the skin.Can't say it's much slower, either.  Maybe a little more time, but it's a more enjoyable shave.  (I shave with a new edge every shave, and it's nice)Harder to buy?  Get the handle and 100 blades on Amazon.  You're done for pretty much a year.http://www.amazon.com/Merkur-Long-Handled-Safety-Razor/dp/B000NL0T1Ghttp://www.amazon.com/Double-Safety-Razor-Blade-Variety/dp/B0038KA5RC/ref=pd_sim_194_31?ie=UTF8&refRID=18DSZV9JF8TE11GD72X0I went with the Personna for my first 100.  They work great, but gonna get that sampler for my second to see if there's something better.
Better shave for a lot of people. Seriously there's a reason even gillette still sells trac 2 blades. Their 'top of the line' shit sucks. When I told my friends how much work i'd put into trying to improve my shave routine they all started telling me in private how dissatisfied they've all been. Not everyone wanted the whole 20 minute health spa route so I would just show them the extras I had in my bathroom, showed them how I used them and told them to take what they liked best. One took an astra and barbasol, one took a safety razor and shave gel, one took the shave soap for her legs. It's only dangerous for the first timers and those who don't mind what they're doing, you can still find blades at the pharmacy, amazon always exists and it's only as slow as you like.
I get less irritation and a closer shave. It also costs me less money.try it http://www.amazon.com/Feather-Double-Edge-Shaving-Razor/dp/B003YJ70NY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1432711801&sr=8-1&keywords=feather+popularhttp://www.amazon.com/Cremo-Astonishingly-Superior-Shave-Cream/dp/B009WQH8SA/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1432711856&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=creamo+crem

i might try it. thanks
quick questionhow do I know when to swap blades. carts had a nice indicator strip which was easy to tell.
A blade usually lasts 3-5 shaves.If it starts tugging on your hair a lot, just chuck it and put in a new one.
those indicator strips are uselessthey're designed to turn white after 3 uses, but they stay sharp for much longer than that
aight. thanks againi mean i didnt throw it out immediately when it turned white. I use them just as a general idea of when to throw it out. i still use mine for a few times after they turn white.
Ironically blades are too good.I'm used to cassette razors, but the moment I use blade razor, I peel off layer of skin, I might get better with a little bit of practice, but I can't be bothered.
shaving/beard culture has got to  be the funniest fucking thing to ever exist
>being an actual neckbearddisgusting
preach it brother!
who is this guy?
Left ones give me super nasty burns and don't even shave good, I tried merkur blades. But they are very good for body hair. I use the following technique for safety razors: without any pressure shave many many times,   the cleanest shave I ever had. Funnily it works better with dull razors, I haven't changed mine in 4 months already despite shaving almost every day.
Recently bought one of these at Massdrop.Waiting for it to come.

I use some Merkur safety razor, Feather blades and big related cream.
I use a 760cc>cleans itself>no razor burn, so you can shave against the grain >leaves skin baby smooth even when brushing up against the grain >no water or cream required
I can't speak from experience here but a friend of mine agrees with this, he had that problem and was told to shave with the grain, the important thing however is to keep at it, it may look bad initially but keep doing it for a month or so and it should get better once the hairs grow in right. If that doesn't work I have no idea.
>double edge razorsExcept you have to get it done professionally because you can't find any good home systems.
>master racegood one
What blades do you guys use?  I use Gillette Silver Blues, but I'm looking for something different.
I used to use Silver Blues until I got tired of supporting the Russian economy. Personna Lab Blues turned out to be MUCH better, I can get 5 shaves out of one before it even starts to feel used. Made in America.It's no good if you don't have everything on point though. The blade matters, the razor matters, the soap matters, the technique matters. Once I found the perfect combination of all those matters I started getting perfect BBS shaves every day with zero alum sting.
I agree with your method wholeheartedly
How come every old timer I ask tells me the ld shit is not in fact better.
Because modern day wet shaving is a lot like modern day coffee.Back in the old day grandpa had one, MAYBE two brands of blades to choose from, a cheapshit drugstore brush with garbage soap, and mass produced penny Gillette razors. Nobody taught him how to shave, or if they did it was subpar teaching at best. Today you can order literally dozens of blade brands from just as many different countries, you have access to amazing brushes of all hair types from badger to boar to high tech synthetic, access to dozens of razor types, and there is a huge boom in artisan made shaving soaps that puts mass produced formulations to utter shame. And to finish it all off you have access to the internet where you can read lots of advice and tips on how to actually get a good shave.

shaving is not technology i draw the line at pens because they are somewhat funbut fuck, take your product placement elsewhere
I don't trust myself enough to use a straight razor.  Cartridge blades tend to gove me the best shave, but they are too expensive, so I've taken to using a safety razor.
Taking a shit and reading about shaving is a really uncomfortable feeling, especially when you are constipated...

>doesn't twist to openpleb
>tfw can't shave because blackIt must be nice to be white. If I shave more than once in two full weeks, my face turns into something resembling a star trek character.
The boar brush makes it... Of you use cartridge now I suggest focusing on the lather first. Spend at least 25 dollars on a brush and get a good one or you'll be turned away
I'd like to try using a single blade razor.I recently switched from using 5 blade razors to cheaper 3 blade disposable razors because it's either cheaper razors or less food, and it cut exactly as well and didn't irritate my skin no where near as much (I finally get the whole "only one blade cuts hair, the rest just scrapes your skin" thing)Do any of you have any recommended brands for handles and blades? I don't know anything about single blades.
lol no. boar brushes aren't even top end. I use a £1 kabuki makeup brush which gives much better results than my boar brush.I am almost through the 100 derby blades I bought, I definitely think there are better ones out there. Are astra SP worth buying? I have to commit to them because I buy them in 100 and hold on for a long time.I find for the handle itself the higher quality ones are pure luxury - I notice no difference in actual results between a merkur 34c and the 3 dollar rimei razor. It's just comforting to have some german-made stainless steel with its heft.If you want to find out if it's suitable for you get some arko shaving soap, some DE blades, the rimei I mentioned and some sort of brush like I mentioned. a boar paintbrush works fine even. total cost's gonna be pretty low. better than dropping megabux on fuccboi shit like ebony-handled brushes. The soap and brush even work for your 3-blade things - it's just better soap than the stuff you get out of a can or tube.true single-blade like a cutthroat's either very difficult or deceptively expensive to do. DE safety razors are the sensible daily choice.
i tried a safety razor and i couldn't cut shit no matter what i do. Im not poor so i choose to spend more on good blades
Oh yeah, safety razors are what I'm talking aboutI wouldn't trust myself with a straight razor

Electric razors too?
use an electric. I've never cut a bump with one and if you take your time and use them before showering the results are decent.
Shavettes are great too. I used to use a double edge but got a little bored after a while. The shavette takes a lot more focus.
I shave my head, neck, and throat with a 5 bladed from Krogers. One blade lasts about four full shaves. (Head hair tends to wreck them quicker.)It's really fucking easy and way smoother than these safety razor shits.The only way to get a better shave is with a expertly sharpened straight razor.
I have one, and it gets blurred really fast.
10/10 dwarf beard. Would hate elves with
my nigga.I even put a temp second one when I cut my hair
I have been using a double edged razor for ages and it is perfect. I save money and don't see a real downside.
I became addicted to pulling my hair out of my face so I have been epilating and waxing my face. Feels good.
Got one of those to try out for a few months, never really got a better shave than my double edge. Doing your cleft is a fucking nightmare with those.
looking at this makes me cringe, i'm so happy my grandparent have strong german arian genes with full grown hair
I'm surprised so many have fallen for the hipster razor memeNorelco rotary or fuck off.Clean the heads in an ultrasonic cleaner once a month, shave like a king
Have you been to a dermatologist about that?
That's what I usually use. They do reduce irritation, but the hair still curls back into my skin as it grows. I also sweat heavily at my job and have oily skin, so it gets nasty pretty quick.
I have not. I'm going to try and if that doesn't pan out I'll visit a doctor for a prescription.
I made the switch to wet shaving after spending $150 on a nice fucking Braun electric razor and then having it give me both shit-ass shaves AND razor burn.
I trim first to shorten it and use a razor if needed. I usually leave scruff
>implying I'm a grillHow else do you refer to the person you're fucking?
Laser or IPL
m8, I was in your position a while ago.Give pic related try, use it after shaving and once a night before going to bed.Make sure you exfoliate your face/neck, not just wash it. Carbolic soap does the trick well, but it dries out the skin so use moisturiser daily.
>made in AustraliaIs that where you're from, or is this in The States too?
I'm in Canada, you can buy it online, though. Same price as the pharmacy + S&H.

Back when I used to be more serious about shaving I would use 1 cartridge every 3 months. I would shave with shaving gel and when I was done I'd whip the thing around in the air a few times (not against anything), damp dry it with a cloth carefully, then apply isopropyl alcohol to it (sometimes I'd just rinse it a tiny bit with isopropyl). It seemed to do the trick for me. I'd also put isopropyl on the blade each time I was about to shave (forgot about that) after running really hot water over the razer (I'd only use cold water on my face)Nowadays I just use some cheap $20 electric trimmer. I hold it a certain way and go at a moderate speed, always making sure to be cutting against the direction my hair is growing in. It typically leaves me with a little bit of a stubbled look (not too bad) but I'm way past the point of caring.If someone is going to judge me based on my facial hair I'd rather not bother wasting my time talking to them; they probably have nothing interesting to say.
No, she speaks broken japanese in the anime, so that translates to speaking broken english.
Do you shave against the grain?
used my friend's spare norelco when I was visiting him in LA.It's alright I guess, quick and convenient would be the best way I could describe it....but it doesn't get anywhere near as close as a cartridge razor, and at least for me it was more prone to give me razor burn.if shaving is just another annoying thing for you to do in the morning and you just want it "out of the way" as quickly as possible, regardless of the quality of the shave, then they're definitely the way to go.

is there a reason she speaks broken english or is it just to make her cute
What do you do, two fingers spreading the skin or pulling the skin down with from the grain?Only occasionally, normally I go with the grain but I go against if I'm going to an event, it's the only time it ever looks smooth. Is it that bad if it's not all the time?
Her speech pattern differs from the rest of the characters and speaks in the "Laake" language fluently but to avoid confusion Chaika speaks the common tongue (the official language of the continent). However, because it is not her native tongue, Chaika's language fragmented and broken. For example, she will say stuff such as, "Forward! Clear sailing!" or "Akari return!". Her most common phrase is, "Shocking truth!"
oh ok
Stretch in the direction of shaving, when you're over loose skin (or bumpy skin) areas.I have very sensitive skin, so I can't shave against the grain regardless of the attack angle. After a first pass along the grain (I shave every other day), I do two passes against the grain (each in opposite direction) which still makes me pretty smooth. J-strokes in some locations.A gentle soap/cream helps. Nothing alcohol-based. After shaving, I rinse with hot water again to remove any soap residue from pores, but then I use as cold as possible water to close the pores, and then I use witch-hazel based toner and finish with non-alcohol aftershave lotion. This is the only way I can almost completely avoid irritation.The downside is all of this takes 20 minutes, which may be too much for most people.
It only looks smooth for me if I shave against the grain, but that takes twice as long so I just skip it on daily shaves. I have an electric razor too that gets it somewhere between 1 and 2 passes (with and against the grain), but it also causes some irritation and leaves random hairs behind that I find annoying.
I'll take that into account, my chin is the hardest for me to get it always looks a little scruffy.>The downside is all of this takes 20 minutes, which may be too much for most people.That's not that bad for every other day.You ever tweeze the stray hairs? I rarely have that happen but if I finish my routine and find one I yank it out.
If I catch any stray hairs after I'm done, I just take out the DE again and dry-shave them very very lightly. Works fine.
He doesnt buy olfa
doesn't matter what I use or how carefully I do it, I always get red bumps on neck, my beard grows in crazy angles so there's always a whole bunch that are cut against the grainI' already ugly as fuck and my shitty red beard/bad shaves makes me look even worse
Big Ben is my favorite razor and Astra is a close second.If you have yet to try either of them I would highly recommend it.
As a cartridge, DE and straight user - Can we not shill up /g/ with even fucking more marketing bullshit?>/fa/
why would i use pig disgusting curry blades when I can buy feather blades made from superior japanese steel folded over 1000 times?
Straight razor best razor.
First time I've seen someone else post their straight.
straights terrify me too much for me to use them
I didnt really have much else to offer to the thread..I've only really had to shave a few years, so ive used bic razors, electric shavers (my dads) and various disposables.I got this from my great grandad that he said he got in ww2 and he specifcally told me razors are for shaving so I should use it, so I have been.I was worried at first, but ive never cut myself with it, and ive cut myself with disposables.you just take it slow and its fine
The stigma surrounding straights really boggles me. I wasn't nervous before using one and zero nicks later after 2 years, I definitely am not nervous now.Honestly, so long as you don't try to saw off your hairs, you're fine. This goes for straights, DE's and cartridges.
im still pretty slow, ive only shaved ~20 times with it since I had to buy a new strop. It turns out half century old strops are pretty past their prime.So I've got the strop in the post and should be shaving again with it soon.With one blade you just focus more, it takes me ~10 minutes to shave but its not a pain in the ass, almost enjoyable.the first shave was sheer terror, but after that its no worries and quicker every time.
Eventually you'll get to the point where after prepping, it's just as fast as a DE, if not quicker due to having less buildup to deal with.Be careful with the stropping, it takes a hamhand to fuck up the edge but fuck it up you can. Be gentle.
Because I couldn't find those $0.10 per blade and they are fucking expensive as fuck in my country.Then I grew a beard and a trimmer became more useful for maintenance.
Aren't they pretty bad though? For actual shaving I mean, charm aside.Like a slightly worse double edge.
They're fantastic, actually.
Interesting. Do you only do one pass then?I find with double edged ones I always have to do two.
yeah i think ill get my dad to give me a few pointers even though he hasnt used one in a while.best shave ive ever had, could go with or against the grain and had no rash, its great.
One pass yes. The edge quality defines your experience.
i started with 2 passes cause i was too scared to put the appropriate pressure, but yeh now i can do one pass
I'm 26 and I can't really grow a beard, only need to shave once every week or so. It used to bother me but In don't really care any more, all my man bits work properly so I think it's just genetics. Any other beardless bros in here
22 similar situation. not too concerned, my dad didnt grow as much facial hair as me until he was 28 and he's a hairy beast now.either way not concerned though, i stay clean shaven and I've still got hairy arms and legs.
It's a nice blade, I'll give you that, but the engravings give you no tactical advantage whatsoever, unless you were planning to auction it off as a collectors item.
Who Harrys here?
its just a nice blade/family heirloom in the making.I have no idea what its worth but i gather its atleast 50 years old and its got mother of pearl in it.

Feathers have disgusting gobs of wax all over them. So do all the fucking commie blades.
It's not on the blade just in the wrapper and even then it's just in the center. I use a new blade every time and never have the wax come with the blade, it always stays on the paper. Do you regularly have this issue?

>still have to deal with that useless pop-up and animationEh... it's better than nothing.
Okay /g/Just give me a straight answer here and try your best to avoid arguments. I'm only gaming in 1080pSo based off that, what is the best card.GTX 970   $440GTX 980   $720R9 290   $370R9 290x  $500Compare the 290 to 970 and the 980 to the 290x preferably aswell please and let me know everything I need to know before making a decision. Also, does 3.5gb vram issue impose a big issue? All the prices listed are in AUD and the cheapest versions I found. Going off that also consider price premiums.E.g is the performance of a 980 over blah blah worth the extra so many dollars.
Any of those will do for 1080p. Go for the cheapest.
These seem to be the cheapest:http://www.newegg.com/global/au/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127774&cm_re=r9_290-_-14-127-774-_-Producthttp://www.newegg.com/global/au/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150697&cm_re=r9_290-_-14-150-697-_-Product
If you can afford the 980 then thats the best performance, if you want the best performance for the dollar though the r9 290 is the best.If you plan to multi gpu I recommend a 980 and another one later out of those. Sapphire if AMD picks, Nvidia picks go with EVGA, or ASUS. Any pick go non reference coolers.I play at 1920x1080 and I have a 980 because I want it to last longer. I see this pattern of people saying oh the gtx 590 etc is overkill for 1080p! Then a new game comes out and you almost wish you had 1080p performance wise. Of course more pixels is better picture but to me 1920x1080 is still a sweetspot and I just personally prefer a ton of performance.Just look at any flagship in the past 5 years, 1080p is on the way out, but nothing today is "too much" for 1080p if you keep it more then a year.
Jesus Christ. 130$ for a mere 5+% performance increase for 290x. Go for the 290. Unless you can get some super OCed tri cooled bullshit 290x for 130 more. Otherwise the 4-8 FPS gains are pointless at 1080p since you will be solid 60 on anything for years to come.3.5 GB will be a problem depending on what you are doing.Avoid the 980. For that much you might as well just wait for the 390xAMD drivers are fine. I've owned an AMD cards for 3 series' and never once had a problem. 6900 7900 and 290x.
Some people just have a bigger budget like a grand or more for a whole computer, so the part for the graphics card... $500isnt some crazy price. The 980 was really my only option for the most performance I could get for my money. I'm not really interested in spending less for a better value. I know it's there but I save my money for a select few hobbies and have a modest budget despite being pretty poor overall myself.The most for your money is always the $200-250 range anyway since like 10 years now in a videocard. The radeon 9700 pro was the best value for a flagship at only $400. Your argument is valid with a price/performance but understand your goals are not the same as someone elses... hence why $500-600 cards sell like hotcakes still for years now.
OP here, going for the 290. Seeing how its all I can really afford. What should the next upgrades be after that?In really don't want to part ways with my processor, I really like it but there aren't many good motherboard choices to change to  on 1155 that has good expansion and upgrade-ability. Even I were to get the money eventually would it be worth it making the jump to x99?
would help if I attached my specs...
next upgrade would probably be more ram before they discontinue ddr3
better ram, or just more?
wrong id
>GTX 970 $440u wot
you heard. fucking hate this country's pc part prices
your 290's cost about as much as a 290x would cost me. That sucks.
probably just getting 16GB is ram and everything will be fine for a long time since you already have pretty much everything you'd need in a systemmaybe upgrade GPU in 2 years or so after than since CPU performance have been pretty stagnant and your 2600k will probably still last more than 5 years without need of an upgrade
Yep... Everything except the weather in Australia is shit...
If these are your prices, 970 for sure.970 and 290X are pretty close, but Nvidia has more benefits than 290X even if it has more raw power.
had the whole system for a little over 3 years now, the most recent upgrade was that ssd. The 560 has gotta go though. Considering I only really use my ps4 to play fifa now. I'm straying away from half and half gaming and going full PC now. Wish the decsion didnt take as long and I'd actually be somewhere good by now but when I was still in school there is no point not being able to play a majority of games with your friends I guess.
I keep hearing mixed things about the 970?Is the vram issue a problem and will it achieve a higher fps than the 290?
VRAM issue probably won't impact you now at 1080p. Nobody knows when it'll become a problem though, it might hit you in a year or two with modern games, or it might never be an issue at 1080p for the lifespan of the card. It's a bit of a gamble at the end of the day. The 970 usually beats the R9 290 by a few % in neutral games, beats it in gameworks titles and gets beaten in AMD optimized games. Overall it's slightly faster, but not 70 bucks faster. Another question would be whether you want to support gameworks (read up on it, it's terrible for everyone, including Nvidia users) and whether you want to gamble on Nvidia "phasing out" the 900 series as they are doing with the 700 series right now. Not optimizing for them and making them perform terribly in a few years.
I will break it down for you OP please ignore all other posts since most of them are shilling/trolling>gtx 980without a doubt the Fastest card of the lot but also most expensive.  The ratio of performance per dollar is the worst of all cardsonly buy this card if you are running a 120 or 144hz monitor if you are running a 60hz monitor dont even bother >R9-290Xok price/performance. faster than a 970 and cheaper to boot. its slower than a 980 but not buy a whole lot and since its 200$ chepaer that makes it very attractiveif you are using a 1440p monitor with a 60hz refresh rate this is the card you should buy (make sure its a sapphire card they are the EVGA of AMD gpu's)>R9-290best price/performance not much slower than the 970 and significantly cheaper and in some applications its actually faster than the 970Rock solid perfection. Without a doubt the card i recommend the most since AMD doesnt fuck up their lower tier binned chips the way nvidia does (4gb on this card, not 3.5gbIf you are running A 1080p monitor at the 60hz refresh rate this is the only card you should be looking at it scores a perfect 60 average, 30 minimum on Valley ExtremeHD at stock speed the only games it will give you less than 60fps on ultra for an badly designed games the videogame design clusterfuck that is witcher3 is a good example but even in that worst case scenario you still get over 50fps average with ultra settings because the raw power of this card compensates with brute forceOddly enough alot of nvidia owners are having witcher 3 crash and artifact (its a gameworks game optimized exclusively for nvidia and that makes this hilarious) whereass AMD cards are running fine so even though you will be slower you will actually still be playing >gtx 970By far the worst card he card has a serious micro-stuttering issue along with the 3.5gb of VRAM. Also it is more expensive and slower than a 290Xwould not recommend this card
Man, I'm returning my 970 for a 980. Gaming at 1440p on a 970 doesn't cut it.

Is it realistic for someone who has never replaced a read/write head in an external to pull it off without a hitch? I'm considering doing it because my dumb ass didn't back anything up before this piece of shit fell off my desk and stopped working.The bottom r/w head was completely bent out of shape when I looked, and wouldn't read any data at all. I've checked out a few videos and it looks like I need an identical HDD and a tool to surgically transplant it from one to another.I'm not taking it to a professional because I don't feel like putting my sensitive data at risk to some random joe. I'm only trying to justify the cost of doing this at the risk that it might not even work. Thoughts?
>Is it realistic for someone who has never replaced a read/write head in an external to pull it off without a hitch?yeah, no
>Is it realistic for someone who has never replaced a read/write head in an external to pull it off without a hitch?Not a chance in hell.If you've already opened the drive, its too late.RIP anon's data.
No chance, either you go trust some random joe or your data is gone.Have a fresh backup the next time this happens (AKA set up software + hardware so it does back up).
If you've already opened the drive then it's gone.Drives should only be opened in factory clean rooms with proper tools and hardware.
Have you SEEN the environment those kinds of things are manufactured in? Infact I'll bet the insides of that HDD have never been touched by human hands at all. You've opened it, you've ruined it.
Opening the lid doesn't damage anything. It's the dust that may collect on the platter, but hdds dedust themselves via centrifuge force.
Hard drives are powered by magic you fucking muggle
I've transplanted a few, but then again, I have experience with sensitive electronics.

spray hot water from the shower head to steam the room like mad>wait for the steam to disappear taking the dust down with itI've heard this a lot, does it actually work?
I guess I could try this. I really want my data back, even if it's only a fraction of the least important stuff.It's not that simple because the sensitive data is private company information that could get me sued to hell and back if it got into the wrong hands.
Sounds like something you should've backed up.

What does /g/ think of otterbox? Good cases for high end phones?
I think 99% of people who put Otterboxes/Guardian Cases/Other EXTRA-RUGGED cases on their phones are fucking retarded. Acceptable reasons to have an Otterbox on your phone:You're in construction/Contracting and must use your phone in an environment that puts it at danger of shock, dust, liquid, and other hazards.You NEED to specifically use an iPhone near Water.Non-Acceptable reasons to have an Otterbox on your phone:You're prone to dropping your phone (Stop being a sperglord)You've dropped/damaged your previous phone (Stop being a sperglord)"My Kids are really rough!" (Well teach your kids to not treat you and your items like garbage)"But what about when I give it to x-year old?" (First off, your x-year old what. Child? Finish your sentences. Second off, your x-year old child should be learning and exploring with items of their own. Not yours.)"I work near/in water!" (Get a waterproof phone. They exist. And in in-end form factors. See above if your company sucks apple cock)"B-b-b-b-better to just be protected..." (No, it's not better to look like a fucking jackass with a fisherprice toy. Be responsible)In Short:Don't be a sperg lord and buy some fisher-price case for your phone/tablet.
Even though I have large (read: fat) hands, and most modern phones actually seem too thin for me to hold, Otterboxes take them to the other extreme, making phones too big and thick.  In other words, huge overkill.Also, depending on which one you get, the quality isn't very good.  I had one of the ones with the plastic inner part and the rubber/silicon outer part.  Within just two or three months, the outer part started getting loose.  Not only did it look like shit, but it soon would barely even stay on.  I was told I could bring it back to where I bought it, or even send it directly to Otterbox, and they'd replace it for free, but I didn't feel like having to do that every couple months.
Just get a thin clear case and a screen protector, if you must. Or just don't be stupid

I think people like that don't understand how huge and important the kernel is compared to userland code.
You know, I was really tipped off by "Linux OS", but I'm willing to consider that a valid turn of phrase, having given it some thought. This whole thread may be a ruse of course, but what in life isn't?I'd say the most distinctive quality of GNU/Linux is how the majority of the software is under a GPL-esque copyleft license. Note how there are other free software OS's (BSDs, etc) and other operating systems based on the Linux kernel (Android). However, referring to an operating system by its kernel (while it would be a valid example of synecdoche) is confusing, because not only may an operating system have multiple kernels (and vice versa) but it confuses less-technical users as to the nature of the software they're using.wants infinite copyright because copyleft won't work without ithttp://www.gnu.org/philosophy/misinterpreting-copyright.html>One important dimension of copyright is its duration, which is now typically on the order of a century. Reducing the monopoly on copying to ten years, starting from the date when a work is published, would be a good first step. Another aspect of copyright, which covers the making of derivative works, could continue for a longer period.>Ten years may still be longer than necessary; once things settle down, we could try a further reduction to tune the system. At a panel on copyright at a literary convention, where I proposed the ten-year term, a noted fantasy author sitting beside me objected vehemently, saying that anything beyond five years was intolerable>So perhaps novels, dictionaries, computer programs, songs, symphonies, and movies should have different durations of copyright, so that we can reduce the duration for each kind of work to what is necessary for many such works to be published... In my own field, computer programming, three years should suffice, because product cycles are even shorter than that.So how are classes at the University of Faggot, OP?
>I'd say the most distinctive quality of GNU/Linux is how the majority of the software is under a GPL-esque copyleft license.No. Absolutely not. The most distinctive quality is that it runs the Linux kernel.  This, plus cpu arch and whatever version of libc that you have, are the only things that matter when your software decides to run or not. The rest is just bullshit you think is relevant but isn't.
>The most distinctive quality is that it runs the Linux kernelI say again: Android.
>I say again: Android.>implying that's any different from running Linux kernel with a really fucked up desktop environment (like Unity)
Yes, it involves the Linux kernel, but not the GNU/Linux operating system.Of course, if you make enough changes to any piece of software, it can become any other piece of software. If you make enough changes to GNU/Linux you can make the text of Moby Dick. Perhaps this is an insurmountable ontological problem to you.
"Prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, bestiality, possession of child pornography, and even incest and pedophilia … should be legal as long as no one is coerced. They are illegal only because of prejudice and narrowmindedness.Some rules might be called for when these acts directly affect other people's interests. For incest, contraception could be mandatory to avoid risk of inbreeding. For prostitution, a license should be required to ensure prostitutes get regular medical check-ups, and they should have training and support in insisting on use of condoms. This will be an advance in public health, compared with the situation today.For necrophilia, it might be necessary to ask the next of kin for permission if the decedent's will did not authorize it. Necrophilia would be my second choice for what should be done with my corpse, the first being scientific or medical use. Once my dead body is no longer of any use to me, it may as well be of some use to someone. Besides, I often enjoy rhinophytonecrophilia (nasal sex with dead plants).""I am skeptical of the claim that voluntarily pedophilia harms children. The arguments that it causes harm seem to be based on cases which aren't voluntary, which are then stretched by parents who are horrified by the idea that their little baby is maturing.""There is little evidence to justify the widespread assumption that willing participation in pedophilia hurts children. Granted, children may not dare say no to an older relative, or may not realize they could say no; in that case, even if they do not overtly object, the relationship may still feel imposed to them. That's not willing participation, it's imposed participation, a different issue."All real quotes of Richard Stallman.So you have a jewish fat neckbeard that is also a paedophile and zoophile and have Asperger as your idol role model and philosopher, and you loose you productivity, friends and remain a jobless virgin for following his crazy GNU/Kosher.

Should i swap (sell) my Sapphire R9 290 TriX with an Asus R9 290 DC2? I want to get the Asus because the warranty will be end at March 2017 where my Sapphire card warranty will be ended at March 2016. By this, i will get 1 year extra warranty with 0 cost.
I thought the ASUS 290/290X really shity coolers, or have they fixed the problem where one of the heatpipes didn't even touch?
Nope. They just bolted their Nvidia cooler on there and called it a day. It was never changed, and the card is hot and loud as a result. You'd be nuts to swap a Sapphire card for one.
i have the r9 290 DCUII and while yes, one of the 5 heatpipes only makes half contact with the GPU die, i still only hit 75-80 deg. under full load
Not unless you intend to replace the stock cooler.DC2 is a fine cooler, but the design doesn't line up for AMD cards so the largest of the heatpipes doesn't even touch the GPU die.
Actually a question, is the orange section of the sapphire card in that picture metal or plastic?
its plastic
so, it can't be fixed and i should not swap my card then?the reason is the 290 will be rebranded so i just want to increase its lifespan. Does the Sapphire card have high failure rate? My friend a miner said that the card fan always fail.I also think of crossfire since it was quite cheap but i need to change my motherboard and power supply which i think it is not cost efficient.thanks
Just an advice for the future:Never trust a >friend, especially not if he uses terms like >always
well, he had like 13 R9 290. The picture is during our chats and the card he had for mining.
mining is a completely separate use case than gaming or anything. miners beat the shit out of their cards by running them at full load for extended time periods.
Sapphire is the "EVGA" of AMD spec GPU's and asus is a shit-tier brand whos products have an frighteningly high failure ratetrading a sapphire card for an asus card to get a longer warranty is like trading an Astin martin in for a ford focus for the extra warrantyin other words OP are you mentally fucking retarded?
Sapphire have great quality, almost all my sapphire cards are usable (some 3-5 years old) and the ones that aren't usable are just too old.
>Does the Sapphire card have high failure rateNo, Sapphire is basically the tier1 AIB/OEM for AMD.They've been an ATi/AMD partner forever and have always made quality cards.>Their old ATi Chipset motherboards were pretty nice too.>This board was made in 2006...
I don't post threads very often but I need to buy a new mobo/ cpu. I'm debating between4 DDR3 slots vs 8DDR3 vs more expensive DDR4I run VMware with a few VMs quite often, my old PC had 18GB Ram and it was just enough. I plan on using my old ram (2x4gb & 2x2gb if I get a 4 slot mobo) until I can buy 4x8gb. Is DDR4 really necessary if I plan on using this PC until 2020?for reference my old board was an EVGA x58 SLI
i'd hold out til DDRMAX if i were you
DDR4 is important if you plan on keeping this machine for that long. Upgrading DDR4 will be much cheaper than DDR3 once it hits mainstream for both AMD and Intel, if what happened to DDR2 when DDR3 got going is any indication. if you needed 8 slots before, you will need 8 slots to upgrade to later.
What do you use it for?>gaymen and everyday useDDR 3, 4 DDR3 slots>workstation for video editing, 3D rendering etc.>DDR4, 8 DDR slotsEasy as that.>planning on using this PC till 2020Thats fucking stupid, but you'll be fine with DDR3 till then, in case we are talking about gaymen.
Anyone got the six monitor edit of that picture?
Best free VPN for firefox? I have heard of Hola, but I would rather not be an exit node because who knows what traffic may go threw my node. I would prefer one that has an opt out or opt in option for being a node.

the machine wishes to learn more about our ways
I could use some help, /g/. I'd like to learn some programming, specifically to create a video game. Nothing major, just a low poly style exploring game. Honestly even creating a basic world and character would be amazing. I was thinking of using blender for the 3d models, but what do I use to create the actual game? I've heard that visual basic works well, but is that it?
You can use Unity 3d, unreal engine, or even blender, because it has is own game engine
So Blender is all I need to actually create the game? I'm downloading it right now and have some tutorials up on learning the basics.
I've heard that Unity 3D is easy to use. OP should probably go look at /3/ for modelling advice.
Well you can use any game engine.Unity 3D should be the best for what you want to do.Here's a list of game engines.
My problem with unity 3 is most of the time models have a weird shininess to them, that's why I originally chose blender
You can import objects from blender, zbrush or whatever.http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-ImportObjectBlender.html
Thanks guys, I appreciate the help.
Unreal 4 is arguably easier than unity because of blueprints, and also supports more advanced of graphical features.
C++ if you really wanted to get into it
Real advice on /g/. Is it 2003?
Be forewarned, blender's learning curve is steep, and it's documentation sparse/out of date. Still a good program, just not the easiest to use.
Holy fuck, is 4Chan being helpful?  Might as well jump in there too.  Just recently started messing with Modo.  Quick to learn so far.  I'm liking the results.  Would post an example but I don't run that on my laptop.
No, its just that OP isnt a complete faggot
Not to be the freetard but isn't Source a viable option?
To be fair most of the learning curve for Blender is grokking the idea of 3D modeling and thinking spatially. Finding the features (and hotkeys) for doing what you want is a minor issue that you can't really avoid in any software.
So far this is what I've been able to do while watching tutorials. Hopefully soon I can start making character models. I'm enjoying Blender, it doesn't seem too bad.
>top lad has a serious question that has nothing to do with consumer technology or OS preferences, literally nothing that would attract shills>surprised when people actually op
Have you tried importing anything to Unity to see of it looks like you want it to?
No, I didn't know I could do that. Should I?
No, /g/ is just not serving /v/ as tech and consumer support any more. If you want shitposting, you can always check those threads.Also: Well, yes. Unless you're planning to make the game with the blender engine (I think Unity is much easier to work with for beginners).
I would totally play a game that looks like that, gj anonAnyways, from I hear for basic 3d games Unity is by far your best bet. it's full featured and has a relatively high-level language for a 3d game engine. Unreal is good for more complicated stuff but it's not really geared toward small games, and afaik the blender engine is a proof of concept rather than a full engine
Well I've had several people tell me that Unity is going to be much easier and better than blender for the actual game engine, so I guess I'll switch to that once I have models and maps created.
>it's full featuredOnly if you pay for it. Which I don't think OP should do as he still learns. But the free version is ok for learning, and there's the blender engine out there, too.
Unity dropped the wierd "lol no light sources" stuff already, the only thing you have to deal with is an ugly watermarkhttp://unity3d.com/get-unity
For 3D modeling I just torrented Maya,
I suppose so, it's just got the typical "programmer designed ui" that you see in a lot of FOSS stuff. (And 3D$ Max)
Or you can get any autodesk program free from their student program which you dont actually need student credentials for. Also, why maya and bot 3DSmax?
Those watermark stuff though. Can make commercial applications less feasible.
They do? Ive been using 3dsmax with unreal engine for a couple years and never noticed any watermarks...
/g/ please tell me. If I don't have drawing skills, it's impossible for me to become good 3d modeller and make at least indie games?
Yeah it's totally different, I can't draw for shit but I got good enough after only a year at school.
The student version? I could swear it had one last time I used it.
Spent the last 2 hours learning how to build a basic house. Unfortunately I didn't bother changing colors before I put it together and I don't think there's a way to color it properly now. No matter, I can always make another house
I made https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwxDazpz3zHpaE53ZXVTZWRONnM/view?usp=sharing using OpenGL and blender models it'd fairly straightforward but you need to know some more advanced Java for it.
That's pretty cool man, I'd love to do something like that, hopefully unity helps me out so I don't have to learn java.
Since we're talking 3rd party engines, does anyone know of any practical tutorials for Unreal 4 on the C++ programming side? I've had a hard time finding anything decent, or even code examples of something beyond their sponsored tutorials. I got it free through the github student pack but its sat idle on my desktop.
i wouldnt mess with blender, use it for modelling if you like, but as far as the game engine goes you're better off with unity/unreal.
>download blender>can't create anything>get sketchup>it's easy as shitAny good blender tutorials?
https://cgcookie.com/blender/cgc-courses/blender-basics-introduction-for-beginners/
OP it is better to work from the top down. First you should take a game like skyrim and start modding it. See what it is like to work on a prebuilt game with an advanced toolkit.Next go a level down. Make a game using unreal engine, which has tons of tools that allow you to create a game.Next go a level down and create your own engine, like you're currently discussing.Don't start by trying to re-invent the wheel. This is the hard way.
true. for a beginner, blender game engine is clusterfuck.
I've slowly been getting better at Blender over the past few months. Are there any better tutorial project courses for Unity than the official one? Those ones just kind of assume you're already familiar with C++ and skim over the scripts, while I'd prefer a set of tutorials that teach you C++ within the context of Unity. (and I learn better by being walked through making a project than just reading supplementary material)
C++ and OpenGL
There were some tutorial things i bought on steam a while back for a dollar or so on sale. They supposedly go through everything but i havent done it yet. Ill get back to you tommorow on what its called if thread is still alive.
the problem with drawing on paper is that you cannot undo strokes or nudge lines, try a cheap wacom tablet in Krita or Incscape and it might be easier for you. Or you could limit yourself to simple geometric objects or generate shapes algorithmically. Or you could say "fuck it" and crudely draw everything in MS-paint if it fits the theme of the game
I've heard that this icon is universal but how true is that? If I was making a website that might be read by users in, lets say asia, would they still know what it is and what its function is?
a series of lines looks like a lista list of optionsa menu
Man, maybe they could-- I don't know-- click on it to find out what it does or something.
it's literally called hamburger. look it up
You know what's an even better way of showing a menu on a desktop application?A fucking menu bar.
>lets say asiaDAS RACIS
its used by lazy devs how cant figure out how to draw a cog
been around since at least 1981first seen on the xerox star
Don't know, but one thing that has bothered me: If a user has a large enough screen please don't hide the menu in a burger icon, just display the menu alongside of the content
I kind of hate it. It doesn't look like something that should be clicked on.
This. It was also used for the window menu in Windows 1.0. It's probably one of the most ubiquitous icons in computing.Also, if they're viewing your website at all, they probably have a hamburger menu in their browser or somewhere else on their device.Cogs imply tools or settings. It's probably a really bad decision to use a cog if you're OP and your menu just has different pages on your site.
fucking murricans and their obsession for hamburgers
A few weeks ago, the Japanese company I work for was having a debate over whether Americans would know what it was and what it did.
I've been using my s4 for all of 2 years now with no problem until now.  The phone is blue promoting me to restart almost every 5 - 20  minutes due to an error claiming that the sims card cannot be detected. How do I solve this problem? Is it a matter of a faulty sims card or my phone in general that needs to be replaced?
