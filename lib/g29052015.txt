I'm really interested in getting OSCP certified, has anyone on here completed the program? I have a couple of questions:1 How difficult is the certification?2 What do I need to learn in order to be successful in this program? I want to purchase the least amount of Lab hours so that I can save some money. Any books are highly appreciated.3 Is the certification worth it? I'm a newbie to pentesting but I believe this certification will give me a goal I can set my eyes on to improve my learning process and keep me focused.
bumping and lurking
Hi /g/, I have a website featuring a lot of .webm files. However, right now I use a very small video tag as a thumbnail which slows the page down A LOT, especially on category pages where there are more than 20 thumbnails on a single page.How do I make thumbnails of a webm file using PHP without using ffmpeg? I can't image 4Chan used ffmpeg, so what are the other options?
bump
, 
I realised, its over. We lost. We, who care about privacy, lost.I tried. Even if you manage to turn off all the tracking, js etc. They still know.You can achieve absolute privacy, but not a single website will work corectly, even 4chan is not fully operational without DOM active.Im only one in my neighbourhood who care about this, but i think that its about the comfort and people's laziness not to learn about how their data are treated with or why is vast majority of all the services "free" on the web.What to do ?Eventhough I have an iphone, I've watched google IO15 yesterday and they are going the same path.There is just no way to use web without giving away your data for whatever reason.There is always something behind, whether its marketing, general knowledge or prevention reasons, data collection is everywhere.And meta data ARE personal data in the end.what to do /g/ ?
We, who care about privacyEven though I have an iPhoneWhy the fuck would you give a shit about privacy if you had an iPhone?Also of course they'll always know. /g/ likes to think that an alternate to trying to encrypt and disable things, is to get a dumb phone but even those things tracked you by simply having a cellular signature.Also it sucks to not be naive, doesn't it?
it does.as well as seeing other people willingly giving away everything, that wouldnt do if they would know whats going on
2015not scraping websites in bulk via Tor and browsing them offline to obfuscate your real preferencesISHYGDDT
I don't think they would care even if you told them. Like if you said their information was being sold to companies for ad stuff, they'd just shrug it off and not care because something like that is akin to paranoia. Similarly about 'how they can track you!!!'. Normal people do not give a shit about being tracked or followed or anything unless it's creepy people like they show in them movies.There's levels of paranoia and people like us, or /g/ in general range from mid level Fucking trackers to Extreme Tinfoil; they're tracking my every step!!!!!!!!!!!If you could press a button to make them instantly learn about what goes on, most of them still probably wouldn't care about it because they don't have that level of paranoia. However with learning it you can also unlock that potential paranoia.I've just kind of accepted it as being inevitable/impossible as well, namely because I don't want to be a guy who coats his walls in copper and wears a tinfoil hat believing the Government is watching him fap to lolis even though he's sitting there using the internet which 'muh tor/vpn', your name is still registered to an ISP, your bank name exists, etc. It's the woes of modern technology. I'd be teaching yourself to get numb over these small paranoia/annoyances and just stick to the ones that influence you right now Pop ups that say 'expand your cock by 5" in three days" or other intrusive shit. If you can't see it, don't care for it. Or try not to.
but even those things tracked you by simply having a cellular signaturethinking the activities are simply limited to tracking2014 called, they said you should try to keep up.
even though he's sitting there using the internet which 'muh tor/vpn', your name is still registered to an ISPmuh tor, your name is still registered to an ISPYou don't understand how Tor works, do you?
using the webTime to go live in the woods.
I don't really care tbh, worst thing that's happened to me is targeted ads that I block anyway.
Privacy is still viable in this day and age. There is an inverse relationship between privacy and convenience though. If you are so concerned with privacy you can use TOR to VPN and wget on a librebooted t400 running Parabola. You aren't as concerned with privacy as you claim, otherwise you would already know this. Also, throw away your iphone.
So what, the only thing this means is that you can directly manipulate companies because you're feeding them with your own actions, which you have control over.Always use others to your advantage anon, fuckers ain't worth acting morally correct over.
The name of the game now is not to avoid leaking information, but rather to generate enough white noise that when you do require privacy no one looks your way.
What the fuck did you just say about my security setup you little bitch? I'll have you know I'm running 3 chainlinked VPN from the 3 most trusted VPN companies for privacy. You think that's all you little faggot?  As an extra layer I also run Tor browser in private mode with Noscript and Javascript disabled. All of this is behind a linux distro in a virtual machine with all internet and outports SCRAMBLED making me virtually untracable. Still trying to question me you little shit? The entire thing is on a 32gb thumb drive, which I only use on an unmarked laptop while wearing GLOVES and using only my neighbor's high-quality internet.Everything's encrypted, bitch.  Veracrypted, with a 26-character password and key files required.B-b-but ww-w-hat if they find your usb drive and crack it? That's the beauty of it all you whining faggot. They'll never find it. The thumbdrive is disguised as a fully functional BIC lighter with removable bottom. To top it all off I have electrified magnetic strips installed all around my house to ruin any hardware that leaves my room. Now what could I be hiding with such importance you may ask? An entire 32gigs That's Gigabytes for you non-hackers full to the brim of encrypted pictures that I took of my computer monitor which was also displaying, you guessed it, more encrypted pictures. You can't do a damn thing to stop my encryptception. I swear to Anonymous I will shit privacy all over you until you drown in it. You’re fucking unencrypted, kiddo.
This man, right here, knows his shit.
If you've ever thought you were anything but a slave to your governments you already suck at life. This isn't anything recent either, it's been that way for a long time.
Oh, so that's why you're NEETing in your momma's basement... it couldn't be because you're a spoiled, entitled cunt.
what to do /g/ ?Get computer engineers to move their ass and promote free software to the public by hosting lectures about what the Internet is it’s not clients consuming content provided by servers, why privacy matters and what computer litteracy is.There is a huge education people need to go through. People who judge software bythat’s user-friendly with big icons and rounded corners :DDDCLI is for geeky nerds with nothing better to do, I understand nothing anywayshould disappear.Don’t expect Stallman to do that. He hosts one lecture a year and he always says the exact same bullshit about why he should have all the credit for Linux.TL;DR: This kind of lectures should be more popular, hosted by many more people and in many different language.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoRGoQ76PK8
You're supposed to feed them bad data, not completely block it.Retard
People who judge software by user-friendliness should disappearFalse. CLIs should disappear. The free software movements needs more UX designers.
Tell me how people who don’t want to know anything about computers will get interested in privacy and net neutrality.
The first step is to make free software a viable option for the non-IT guys and girls. At the moment it's not.
Thing is OP: expecting privacy on most sites is like expecting a shop to disable its security cameras because they violate your privacy. If you don't want to be tracked, you've just got to use other services.And the internet as a whole is like this. It was built and is maintained by organisations who spend huge amounts of money on it. They're the only people who have any sort of right to it, as I see it they can do with it what they want.
"You cant fully hide yourself!"enjoy that lie spread by the same people you are trying to hide from. You just dont want to put the actual effort in and would rather believe there is nothing you can do so that you dont have to.
be the average /g/ usergoyishly buy the latest shitdroid/iCuck smartphone every yeargoyishly upgrade my "custom" /v/ approved gaming shitbox every year to surf the web and write shitty code for nobodygive all of these companies that made the current predicament possible my moneyevery year"I care about privacy"lol
You can achieve absolute privacyNo you can't, the NSA have you fucked from the firmware of your hard drive/mobo to hardware backdoors in cloud servers
this arrogant, counter-productive mindset is why most free software is a failure in the mainstreamyou're a bunch of fucking nostalgic 90s kids who live in the past and feel smug about it, you don't care about making software people want or can benefit from over its competitors, you only care about shilling a dated ideology from the days of writing your own software in BASIC because most proprietary software was designed by businesses for other businesses, not home users and hobbyists.you should fucking disappear
You're not even private there. With drones and the ability to record super high quality footage from above for hours, we're fucked.
You can just turn off your computer, OP.
This. Freetards don't really care about privacy or security. They care about their little religion. If they cared about those issues, they would have produced the most user-friendly, retard-proof OS and software ever to get more people to use it.Instead, they appeal to power users who can go elsewhere if they really have to.
Something tells me we'll all be running away from the grid before too long.
ITS OVERMICROSOFT WON
It looks like ass
Lol won at bloat

Boring operating system.
Yes, we already knew.
Are they slowly expanding the start menu so it covers the whole screen again or something?
you don't even use it, do you? why else would you not use a personal screenshot.unpin the apps in the start menu, disable the search bar on the taskbarpic related
its on my laptop thats in a drawer im too lazy
shilling for memesoftget a normal job you brown indian fuck
Why is the ui so bloody beautiful
Looks awful, still.  And its appearance offers no greater utility, still.I want this design trend to go and stay gone.
I don't like the face of the Indian guy. It's gonna be pleasurable to see him go down in flames when Windows 10 tank the fuck out and the share holders panic a little. This is Windows 8.2, a turd with a little extra polish. I'll use Windows 7 until they release Windows 11.
it's basically Windows 7 with less overhead, more touch features, and less metro crap.
inconsistent GUI and iconswinning
In ten years we'll look back at this flat trend as the biggest blunder in design history. It's form over function all over again.
There is no windows 11
if anything everythings going to continue to be simplified so anon's grandma can use it
There will be once they abandon the idea of "lol Windows 10 forever".It's gonna have 10% market share in a year.
you can use it full screen and as small as you want too
what are we supposed to see here?"Life at a glance" and "Play and Explore"?smarter people will just use something like classic shell to remove all the bloat anyway.I'm worried about having account tied to everywhere though.
why does it look like a chalkboard
Fuck this gay earth.

You can change what is synced like internet history and passwords. A majority of your settings will be synced with whatever device you log into. All my shitposting images are on onedrive now for maximum efficiency
for now.Soon enough there will be an update that force you to use one.
Is there an easy way to disable all forms of sync?
They've more or less thrown out every UX principle they've gathered up to this point, stripped the OS, and replaced it with nothing better and in most cases, absolutely nothing at all.All I want to know is why.  How does this happen again and again throughout history.
Windows programs and workspaces.Loonix to the trash it goes.

MICROSOFT WONimplying there was ever any doubt
Goddamn, i wish i had a job shillnig for MS, i would do it for 300$/month, i bet that's half what they pay nowIf someone from MS reads this, contact me on gibjob4real@cock.li
source?
mad at M$?
I think it's a generational/paradigm thing. A change in thought, a wind of new perspectives getting hold on a new generation of designers and decision makers. There is likely both credible and bullshit theory behind it all. Just like trends elsewhere in society it will pass, and hopefully this time around it'll be short lived. There is an underlying need for efficiency and productivity in an OS, hopefully this need is strong enough to shape the UI design in the future towards something more functional. I've seen how buzzwords and this trend have swept the design community with my own eyes, it's very much a fad and nobody seems to know a way out of it. After all, design is very constrained and limited, more so than anyone actually want to admit. There is only so much you can do with a GUI..

They won my fist in their asses
tfw no qt currynigger gf ;__;
God they make me sick. Windows is still windows though.
They'll keep winning until the others get a significant amount of games.
you can, but it cost 300 ore eachyou start mining ore with every valid click over elements during your daily usagethen you can buy icons, settings, colors, disk space and even RAM with your ores
There won't be a point. It will be like linux distros and mac where you can easily swap out entire portions because it was broken up into smaller programs.
Fixed it with future projections.
I would rather hang out with Indians than disgusting Americans.
cool, now provide citations for your data.
games are the reason why people use an operating system Typical wintard
Doing way better so far than with the dumb bald white american
This shit is making me metrosexual.
you change one letter in that pic and everything makes much more sense
It is for most people that play games on a computer.
citation from the future
Well there will be some need to separate out major revisions, and MS will want do distance them selves from the Windows 10 name once it fails. So the marketing dep will have to create a new buzzword for the replacement, and it'll likely be "Windows 11".
what are projections
Home user: Convenience.Business: Convenience.Gaming: Windows.Convenience: Windows.
Ape Fest?orApp Pest?
Damn I'm in love.

Usability is the same/better as 7, you can unpin tiles and all command elements can be accessed by right clicking on the start button.

Forced metro everywhere.No thanks. I'll keep using my Seven.

Yup, confirmed for idiots
Hasn't Microsoft always won?
You sound like a fat, un-fun faggot.piss off m8. Go back to working on your kernel.

Nay, you will have to google for such things.
I figured perhaps you were a connoisseur of stuff like this and had a collection..
implying desktop gnu/linux ever had a chance.Things have come a long way in the past 10 years in GNU/Linux desktop but the community is full of mentally ill idiots.You either have the silent ones not saying anything at all, highly autistic and violent ones raging like fuck and then all the newfags talking shit to Windows users with meme language like "winblows" and "micro$hit" because they are still with the rose-tinted glasses on. All have one thing in common, the gnu excuse of blaming everyone but gnu. linux, themselves for things to fail on their platform and not anywhere else - often going in to autsitic tinfoil hat ramblings about nsa.Chances of GNU/Linux desktop ever getting 5% will never happen in the next 20 years because the community is a cancer, worse than religious extremists.
Oh and pic related.Nobody cares about Linux, people pick it up once then get shit on by autists or nothing working right and turn 360* and moonwalk right back to Windows/OS X.

This is what happened to all the old people in my area. They stopped giving a fuck and went to OSX
Shes not enabled by default as long as you never agree to their thing on setup
you don't even have to read the EULA to know that, there is a ON/OFF slider for it during the OS setup.
No, but I will want to actually disable/remove the component, can you show me a screenshot of where to do this?I believe it's in the "Language" settings?Also, can I make the All Programs look like it did in windows 7?Can I also do the same for search?Finally, can I make sure that the search box never appears in the taskbar area?
Windows XP can help you.

Got this rumor of what's happening right now at Microsoft...'There was an emergency "All Hands On Deck" email that went to all of OSG Operating System Group that the bug count for Win10 was much worse than Win8 at this stage of release. In fact, the number of bugs and trend was worse than Vista before they did the 'reset' that got them on-track to scope down Vista and actually release it.There are 1500 of the total number of OSG employees on the fast track builds at the moment testing build 10130. MSFT did away with most of their traditional testers with the recent layoffs. They kept the few testers formerly SDETs who could qualify and re-titled them as developers.Since OSG has more than 3 times this number of employees more if you count the Windows Phone people who hate being considered part of OSG, less than 1/4th of the employees in the OS group are running the latest 'fast track' builds. The reason? They're unstable for daily work.Overheard recently from some PM's running Windows 10 internally: "We should get hazard pay for running this piece of _____ OS!" No joke.'
Confirmed for hearing it on 4chan.
what a pile of crap. Build 10130 was compiled 7 days ago and there wasn't a new build since because they are testing it thoroughly before finally labeling it Windows 10 beta1 and releasing it next month.
what is customization
who's actually going to use that search bar at the bottom next to the start menu
i do
People who is not afraid of change.When Win95 was released people didn't actually use start menu. Those Program Manager fuckers are still out there.
I probably might. Easy access is rather nice.
The Apple shills are getting better, guys.
I will. I'll probably collapse it to icon size though.MS needs to shove new features into users faces, or they won't use them. If user doesn't like it, there is always an option to disable it. If MS is smart, they will package Windows Tour with Home edition, where some narrator with a soothing voice will take users thorough Win10 features.
4 finger swipe on laptop touchpads make the search bar redundant.
Are you people actually proud of this shit?
So it looks like I'm installing classic shell again
I admit, I don't use it. But for most PC users many of which are laptop owners they don't need yet another new box confusing them on the desktop when they first log in.
I won't because I want more space on the taskbar, and Win+S is faster anywayBut I might check in with Cortana every now and then for weather and news updates and whatever else she can do
This. Google style.
That's why I like MS applications better than GooglesWhen MS changes something, you're encouraged to try the new way but you can change it back if you don't like itWith Google, if you don't like something, then tough shit,this is how it works now

Does anyone still use Opera anymore?I remember I used to use it from 2008 to 2010 but after Chrome came out I ended up switching over
but after Chrome came out I ended up switching overSo did Opera.
Does anyone use anything but Chrome anymore?Let's face it, Chrome won, and only baby ducks are still holding on to anything else.Maybe Edge will be able to dethrone it.  Will be neat to see.
What's a goat phone?I started out with ie when I first started using the internet.Hen when I realized there was more than one browser I switched over to Firefox. Then in high school I switched to chrome. That's what I use still for the most part.Every now Andy then I have to switch over to Firefox to do some web apps that chrome won't do.
Opera fucking sucks now. They took out the reasons to use it over everything else.
I'm still using Furfax for dat UI customization and how well-integrated the add-ons are.Chrome is great for casuls, I guess.
Only on smartphone because rest is crap
I've been using Opera desktop since 2002. Using Opera 12.17 nowI don't even like it anymore, but literally every other browser that I've tried is just unusable garbage to me. I'm gonna ride the Opera train until the wheels fall off
Might wanna look into Vivaldi if you haven't already.
VivaldiDo people actually think that looks good? What the fuck that's horrible.
I still use Opera.I can't use anything else. I always go back.
Why use a browser that uses its market share as its logo?
It's got a lot of features the old Opera did, though it's still really rough around the edges.Of course like pretty much every other goddamn browser these days it's built on WebKit.
I still use it.Even though i miss the email feature, it's by far the fastest, and most reliable browser out there.chrome = ram hog and botnetfirefox = crashes when it wants to, ram hog, and lagsopera = just werks
I still use opera. It's not the best but I still love it
Yeah, in most cases Chrome just werks and it's fast. Perfect for less tech-inclined users.But I'm not saying it's a horrible browser but it's not as expandable and as customizable as Firefox.

12.17 masterrace . _ . pls come back...
Opera actually has the best hidpi support on Linux right now. I use Opera because it looks the best on my 1440p monitor.
I don't use it any more for security reasons but Opera had the best interface to navigate shit quickly and effectively, Chrome and Firefox have proven to be essentially useless compared to ten year old Opera to builds
Maxthon
I use Opera as my secondary browser.Bretty nice, really.
I use it on desktop only when stuck on a super-slow connection taking advantage of Opera's compression.I use it on iOS pretty frequently because the compression acts as a VPN or sorts, getting around filters and redirects. Works especially well in countries that filter the internet.
I'm gonna keep an eye on that shit. I use the new Chrome/Opera but it's not very good. It's missing like every feature that Opera used to have.
Built on Node.js and React.jsYeah no.
thismaxthon is best alternative browser
I use it on old hardware.  Opera 11 is the oldest browser that still runs half-decent and lets you post on 4chan.
Opera is bloatware.
chrome, maybe Edge when win10 releases
Opera 12.16 is my dd, I'll be switching to SeaMonkey or Firefox when it just can't handle the Internet anymore
I'm with you bro.
not .17Enjoy your vulnerable updater.
I used Opera, up until about a year agoI really like it, but it just used so much memory and so many websites were broken that I switched over to Chrome
implying I use Windows
I used Opera since the days of having to find a way to remove the embedded ads. Then Opera shit itself when it dropped Presto and somehow still had issues rendering sites even with a Chromium underbelly. It has no purpose in 2015. Vivaldi may be okay but it's a fetus right now. I've settled for a very customized Firefox, which isn't ideal but at least they don't bullshit me.
old Opera was the best.new Opera / chrOpera is great too, and it's my backup browser also find it more handy for research-oriented browsing than Firefoxwhat it needs is more configurability, but there's no way i'd ever consider using Vivaldi as my main which is currently Firefox, because the UI is written in HTML5 and Javascript, and that just feels pigdog vomit gross.
True,  used to use firefox myself until at some point after formatting i was too lazy to set it up again. Chromes got adblock, thats pretty much what i needed anyway
I got a virus and it kept downloading Opera, so I never trusted it. It just pissed me off :/
Chromium is just the fastest and best feeling browser, I've got to say.  On almost any other browser playing a youtube video makes the whole thing sluggish, but not Chromium.  Ive been trying to switch over from Chromium due to privacy stuff, but I think I'll be alright with it.
I don't even like it anymore, but literally every other browser that I've tried is just unusable garbage to me.I know that feeling too well.  I'm currently on Firefox with a shitload of addons.  It still isn't anywhere near as good as what Opera was, but it's pretty much the only real option until VIvaldi gets more stuff.
On my el-cheapo windows tablet with 1 GB of ram the only realistic options are Opera and IE.IE was good for the most part, but it suffers with HTML5, whereas Opera flies.
Isn't Maxthon both proprietary and Chinese
Firefox, mate.I use it on my phone. Better readability than Chrome/the native browser.
Chromium never stops crashing on me.
I used Chrome on my desktop for a while, then I contracted sweetpacks and it became corrupted and unusable, tried out Opera and wasn't put off by it.But I have noticed it being slower than chrome in some instances.
Using opera right now, it's honestly the best option.Chrome = botnet+RAMpigFirefox = Crashes+RAMpigIE = LOLVivaldi = ChromeOpera = Chrome reliability - botnet - RAMpig issues.
no, it's dead, they killed it
I used it for a little more than a year before switching to Firefox a week ago. It's better than Chrome, if you don't mind being forced to use the Speed Dial new tab page. It's probably the best browser in terms of speed, but I use Waterfox because I can actually have control over my browser.
Use opera exclusively on FreeBSD.
I use Firefox on my main machine and opera for a shitty laptop i have
i do. it's chrome with less shitty interface.
Serious question. What features did old opera have that Firefox + add-ons doesn't?
everything was more nicely integrated in ui than firefox addons, extremely well optimised memory usage you could have hundreds of tabs open on a toaster and the interface wasn't as sluggish as ff
Old Opera had Presto as their rendering engine instead of Webkit, making it significantly faster.They couldn't keep up with development, and ditched it to contribute to webkit with google.
Funny how Opera they just made opera a shittier version of chrome.

whats wrong with lollipop and android in general ? in your own words /g/ from the top
Battery drain demonInfested with Google's dick
material "design" cancer + hates your battery and wants it drained or dead.
CM is working smooth here, battery life is ok.
Java.
1. The change now detects what charger you are using. If you use an unofficial charger, it will reduce the charge considerably. My charger used to fully charge my phone in 1 hour, now it takes 4 ever since I updated. Using the stock charger fixed this issue, but I don't see what's wrong with an apple Ipad charger. 2. Power button disable on lock screen doesn't work in Cerberus any more. 3. Slightly more battery usage
Battery draining, fragmented, carrier controlled, Java using, designed by autists, icons-for-ants.ics, ugly, crapware, malware, insecure, ugly, and used by sperglord hipster "I want to be different" /g/ faggots.
kitkat is pretty good for the time being, fuck updating to lollipop no xposed modules, root, proper custom roms, ectlollipop lacks the things that make people use android in the first place will be disappointed when Google finishes kicking off access to play store for custom builds verizon cleanrom htc m8
Java and the ridiculously shitty Android APIs.
There was an issue in trying to bring up the keyboard yet it fails to show.
used by sperglord hipster "I want to be different" /g/ faggots.Actually in 99℅ of the non-amerifat infested world hipsters try to "be different" by using Iphones or windows phones.
material design cancerWhat's wrong with it? ;_;
Sucks ass.  Now I cant use ES to move/paste shit from SD to internal.  really gets my knickers in a twist
designed by autistsLiterally most software is sperglord hipster "I want to be different" /g/ faggotsWhat about all the poor people who use it?
its slowly becoming like ios
Wait what, how???
Battery usage basically. But I'm on a Nexus 5 so that never really mattered.The alpha builds of Xposed are actually pretty stable. All my modules work fine on 5.1.1.
first google is pushing for SD card drop, then the permissions, they want to make it unrootable/completely restricted
google
Apple dropped the think different shit over a decade ago. People by Apple because rich people use apple in marketing, their friends use apple, everyone they know who uses apple loves it.
99℅℅℅wat.
So it's now "think the same"?
They've made simple tasks require more than one action to abide by Material Design, which is just a half-assed attempt of being flat like Apple. Flat shit looks too cold and ugly for my tastes anyways. Also, if they ever want to compete with Apple in a serious way, they need to realize that most people don't want as much of a sandbox as Android gives you, and they need to lock it down and make it more user friendly for the average user.
form over function
/g/ being a hipsterfag.
cont'd.I've switched from a Nexus to an iPhone since the Nexus died on me, and I've found that while iOS isn't as customisable, and it's really locked down in terms of making it your own, what it does, it does right. Everything works in the way you'd expect it to and usually if there is an issue it's something only a poweruser would ever discover, so it's fine for most of the people using it anyways.
No issues on my Z3 with Lollipop. Sony actually fixed the memory leak and battery drain.
There is nothing wrong with it.It's just the amount of people using shitty devices with Samsung/HTC/LG shit smeared over top of it in conjunction with their service providers delaying the actual updates to allow time for them to bake their bloatware into it is giving people a shitty impression of Android overall.Google is still to blame however for letting the OEMs and carriers have so much input into the OS in the first place.
battery drainbecoming like iOS
They're phone and tablet OSes.That means they're fucking terrible.No one in their right mind wants some half-assed goddamn pseudo-OS with a terrible touch-based interface and shit apps that you can barely do shit on.Yes, this means other mobile OSes suck too.  This shit needs to die, horribly, right now.End this garbage so we can go back to real computing.
We tried Windows on mobile.It was even more horrible.
funny, I find almost everything on iOS almost never works properly, or is slower than equally price alternative hardware.Thing is I upgrade to the latest flagship smartphone every month or two, so typically when my latest iphone finally arrives I don't do the whole wait in line thing or wake up at 1:00, its already months outdated. So I may be outside the norm here.
Yeah, if you're constantly upgrading I can see why iOS might seem a little bit broken, but even so, I have a 4S am poor and I find that it works much better than the Nexus 4 I switched from.
They're phone and tablet OSes.That means they're fucking terrible.End this garbage so we can go back to real computing.Damn, I thought I was the only one who felt this way.The only interesting thing I've seen smartphones and tablets do is:GPS navigationFinding a well-reviewed restaurant while out and about in an unfamiliar townStuff that is arbitrarily restricted to smartphones.  I think Tinder is this way, or at it at least used to be.Smartphones would be a lot better if:-The US actually got fiber internet errywhere like it was supposed to in the 90s-Smartphones/tablets were not just another computer, but dumb terminals to your home computer where applications were shared between them.  As in, watch 15 minutes of a tv show on a tablet, then turn on the tv in the living room and it picks up right where you left off, instead of depending on your youtube or netflix account to just handle that for you "in da cloud, mane".
The 2013 Moto X still doesn't have it and Motorola decided to do the soak test in fucking Brazil for some reason.
this
2013 Moto G here with 5.0.2 soak test and it runs exactly as well as it did on 4.4.4. Maybe it is all the other companies skins that fuck your battery. Mine has always lasted around 10-12 hours and I'm a heavy user with a lot of screen on time.
As in, watch 15 minutes of a tv show on a tablet, then turn on the tv in the living room and it picks up right where you left off, instead of depending on your youtube or netflix account to just handle that for you "in da cloud, mane"How else would your devices handle this without syncing something, somewhere, to a base server?This "da cloud" meme doesn't make sense to me.
How else would your devices handle this without syncing something, somewhere, to a base server?Ideally a mobile device would not be running the program at all, just acting as a dumb terminal to a home pc/server.  For stuff like games that can't run remotely, you could just sync the settings/savegames/whatever to the home pc, like the way your settings for games on Steam "travel with you" to other PCs.  Except I'm picturing something that isn't locked-in to one company, like Steam-Valve, or GoogleDrive-Google.The problem with mobile devices, including laptops, is that they are just another computer to keep track of.  If you want to work on a Word document you need to have a word processor, ideally the same word processor, installed and working on your workstation, your laptop, your tablet...  Who the hell wants another computer?Google/MS/Apple/everyoneintechnology just want to solve all these headaches with "the cloud", which means:Just give us all your data.We'll keep it for you for when you need it.Seriously, sorting through your own photos and game collection?  That's waaay too complicated for you, pleb.You'll have no idea how any of this works and since we're 800 lb gorillas we'll sell whatever info we feel like to whoever pays, and freely share it with every gov't agency that asks.You'll also have no control over where and how the data is stored and transferred.  Want to cache the HD stream of that movie off Netflix overnight because your 1.5mbps DSL can't stream it live?  Oops, you can't.
lolpop a shite soul cum sucking battery life hogger
just acting as a dumb terminal to a home pc/serverIt was my understanding less and less people are opting for "home pcs" in the first place. Nobody even has a "home server" now.Furthermore you still need software developed to handle doing this. Who manages that software development and distribution?
no its now "think like the cool/rich" people
They're phone and tablet OSes.good thing i'll be using it on my phone then...and tablet
Smartphones would be a lot better if:fiber internetwut?
do you have any idea how technology actually works?
Smartphones would be a lot better if:fiber internetwut?If fiber to homes then no need to "sync" your data to "the cloud", just grab your data off your home pc from your smartphone, because hooray, you have enough upload bandwidth to do that.I could elaborate but I just remembered another programmer fleshed this idea out already.

It's slow.My phone is a 2ghz dual core with 1gb RAM... I'm pretty sure my phone would run Windows 7 smoother than Android 5.1.1.
Oh, I see your point. At least we would still have open files, unless they take that too.
HORRIBLE FUCKING BATTERY LIFEI am literally switching to iPhone for this reason alone.

Lrn 2 nt b stoopid mkay?
My apps crash, a lot.  They crashed once every other week before maybe once a week, but now I have literally two or three apps crashing every day.  Could be the app developers, but that doesn't matter.  Didn't happen on 4.4.4.  I dislike the white background over the black.  It drains more battery and is hard on my eyes at night when I'm browsing in bed.  You can change the keyboard color, but I haven't found a way to change anything else.Everything else seems fine.  Design isn't the greatest and battery didn't improve.
mfw I never have issues with the lollipop update for the s5mfw nothing crashesmfw god tier battery life
What 4chan app is that?
Running 5.1
Nexus 6?
Battery mode: Power saveYeah I guess that works if you never want to get your emails.
Lollipop caused battery drain issues for some people, and there are mixed feelings about whether or not Material Design is any good or not.Android has lag issues because applications run in a Java virtual machine, but this is only a tiny part of the problem. Manufacturer skins and overlays, such as Samsung's notorious Touchwiz also contribute to Android's performance woes.Generally, in my experience with the Note 4 I'm typing, this on,Lollipop has reined in some of the inconsistencies in Ul and lag that heavily plagued early devices. Most of the time around 90%, everything is quite fast.My advice: Use Google's apps such as the keyboard and messenger, as they seem to provide a clean and unified experience.
Ay nigga what 4 Chan app are you using?
clover
Google is hosting all your data if your not blocking it  you agreed to it when you started your phone up

Well it's better than iOS for my uses.I'm running CM12 on OPO. No problems here. Battery life hasn't changed from good ol KitKat.
Microsoft figured out how to provide consistent support to all devices running Windows, despite the large variety in hardware configurations and manufacturers two decades ago.Google still hasn't managed to make any headway whatsoever in that department to this day.  The number of devices running the version of Android released last year is still laughable.
Yours has a material design to it, how'd you get it like that?
 le java is bad because my brain can't understand it meme
Not him, but clover. It's pretty nice and you can switch between dark and light themes.

In my case it is only a personal preference. I dont like the UI, google accounts and have bad experiences with smoothness albeit on cheaper phones becuase of resource hogging.Ever since I discovered a 100€ nokia phone can be smooth as fuck with 512MB ram, have office suite, dual sim and free god-tier navigation all for that money, I never looked back.

iPhones have much better standby battery life, like leaps and bounds better.The problem with Android is not the in-use battery life, but the standby battery life in Android is HORRIBLE.It's one of the things they're trying to fix in Android M, but I've been testing it and it's still not good enough.
Battery and speed of lolipop it terrible along with all the retarded stock apps and glitches are huge

my iphones have the same battery life as androids during heavy usage, but normal usage iphone is way bettermy 6 plus can go an entire night without dropping a single percent charge.
What ROMs come with gapps?
This.It's fucking sad how bad the Android battery life is compared to iPhone.Android has a lot going for it, but its battery life is SHIT.
I really, really liked the KitKat Lock screen with the full screen album art and the widget carousel. I get that they reworked the notifications, and it does look nice, but the lollipop lockscreen looks ugly as fuck.
Cataclysm ROM for N5 does, dunno about others
moto g 2 here, wifi doens't work properly 5.0.2people don't receive all my messages if i don't set prefered network to 2g
I don't mind it that much, but some of the animations are odd. The ring menu sucks now, but I think that's more a rom issue.Sent from my Nexus 5 running AOSiP 6.5There are plenty of layers themes on the play store.Carriers have a tendency to shit over and brand the hell out of their devices. It's sickening.I think there should be a push to either gimp carrier ability to ruin roms or make it much easier to debloat/flash a factory rom.
Isn't that propriety anyway?

Nothing.Dalvik was slow and apps made before material design suck.
Same here using lg g2

Never had an Android before but I was thinking of selling my iPhone 5 soon and getting and Android for various reasons. SD card slot, replaceable battery, customization, piracy, etc. But it seems that Google is trying to prevent users from getting Root access now? Didn't they make it easy to do that a few years ago? What's the point? Is it something they might restore later on or am I going to have to not update and hope for an exploit just like with iOS?
 Android PrivacyYou're better off with iOS
Applications must be made in JavaNo batteryIt has only stopped lagging after octacore phones with 2.1GHZ turboboost, not after software optimizations.
Did you misread piracy?
No, miss read.For piracy you're better off with Android, but it's a dick move

You should really shuffle your deck instead of doing that random access pattern. Use the Fisher-Yates algorithm to implement deck shuffling. [0]You may also want to consider representing cards and players using structs, however you may not be far enough in the literature to be exposed to that stuff yet, not sure.Generally try to declare and initialize your variables at the same time. So do like int firstCard = drawdeck; instead of int firstCard; firstCard = drawdeck;[0] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle

x64 & x86 is rly fun why don't more people learn it
x64
ya what about it?????x64 is different than x86 rcx vs ecx u kno betta dawg
there's no "x64", there's x86 with 32-bit addressing and 64-bit addressing
decemberIt's x86_64Also fuck Jewgle, I picked like 9 streetsigns and 4 pizzas total for this post.
x86/x86-64 ASM is disgusting. All of those fucking instructions keep changing other registers behind my back.Using a nice RISC assembly where only the registers I specify are modified is much nicer.
Then why are exceptions handled differently in 64bit vs 32bit?Then why does windows have to use WOW64 to run 32bit code if the only difference is how addressing works
data_str: "homura".to_string,Found it
WOW64 is for 64bit programs retard.
no it isn't it's windows on windows64 so 32 bit programs can run on 64 bit computers do u know pcs work
"string".to_stringWhat the fuck?
Rust/10
There is alsodata_str: "madoka".to_string,Further down.
String literals are of type 'static str, so to_string converts to a String type.Hopefully that clears it up for you :^
Hopefully that clears it up for you :^Yeah, now i know i'll never be using it.
lel, tards, everyone know what's x64. even intel uses the x64 appellation.https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/introduction-to-x64-assemblyno, seriously, get lost.
You're pathetic. There are actually three modes, i386, x64 short mode, and x64 long mode. Kill yourself.
forget to quote"x64 is a generic name for the 64-bit extensions to Intel's and AMD's 32-bit x86 instruction set architecture ISA. AMD introduced the first version of x64, initially called x86-64 and later renamed AMD64. Intel named their implementation IA-32e and then EMT64. There are some slight incompatibilities between the two versions, but most code works fine on both versions; details can be found in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manuals and the AMD64 Architecture Tech Docs. We call this intersection flavor x64. Neither is to be confused with the 64-bit Intel® Itanium® architecture, which is called IA-64."
see 
Ok here's a more serious answer:String literals are stored inside the executable itself as read-only memory, this is why you cannot modify string literals in C. It's exactly the same shit is Rust. Rust's type for it is a "string slice" or "str" with a static lifetime, which means it can never be changed.If you actually want to modify the string somehow, you need to copy it into Rust's "String" type.
see /meafterclass/
Intel's and AMD'sGiving Intel credit to AMD64Implying Intel's own 64-bit x86 wasn't a complete fuck up
Are you asking me on a date?
You forgot to mention that Intels implementation couldn't run existing x86 programs and was completely worthless.
 There are actually three modes, i386, x64 short mode, and x64 long mode.There are actually 7 modes. In native x86-64 mode, the CPU can run x86-64, 386 or 286 protected-mode code. In legacy 386 mode, the CPU can run 386 or 286 protected-mode code, 8086 code in virtual-8086 mode, or 8086 code in real mode.This is why 64-bit versions of Windows can't run 16-bit executables, as the WoW32 implementation relies upon some 8086 code, and once the CPU is in 64-bit mode, it can't run 8086 code.
How old is too old to get into programming?At what age are the dank kids just plain better and preferred by employers to old dogs?
It included x86 hardware emulation.
emulationHaving overhead for all of your old executables instead of doing it natively
Windows CE vocal assistant with .NET 2.0 and a closed source library
you missed the whole point, dumbass.amd:  x86-64 a.k.a AMD64intel: intel 64 a.k.a EM64Tx64 is the common subset of AMD64 and EM64TEM64T always had backward compatibility.IA-64 is itanium which is a _whole_ new architecture which has nothing to do with x86.is this really hard for you to understand ? are you really this retarded ? please don't be this retarded.
You're confusing Intel's implementation of AMD64 which is almost identical to AMD's, apart from some obscure cases where they deviated in order to reduce the number of patents they needed to license with IA-64 aka Itanium.BTW, neither of those can run 8086 and x86-64 code at the same time other than by using a software emulator for the 8086 code.
Basically AMD gimped 16-bit mode for no reason.
There is no "max age".
yesand c# is always an option
Around 40, I'd say. Maybe late 50s. It's not like learning a foreign language where you need to be 13.
some employers will prefer someone like 40+ years old even if they're not very good at programming
 Basically AMD gimped 16-bit mode for no reason.The reason is that avoids a shitload of complexity for no good reason. Any AMD64 CPU can software-emulate 8086 code much faster than any 8086 or 286 system.Microsoft could have just used an emulator for 16-bit executables, but given how messy that part of Windows is likely to be and how few people are still using 16-bit code, it probably wasn't worth the effort.If you really need to, you can always run Windows 3.1 in DOSBox.
It's not like learning a foreign language where you need to be 13.Everyone is not as stupid as you.
Learning a foreign language once you are out of school is mathematically harder and slower, as shown by numerous experiments and surveys.
str, so to_string converts to a String type.Hopefully that clears it up for you :^What's that mean.static str vs String type?
mathematicallyI think you mean statistically
Statistics is just applied math.

Well i must be a genius so
Are you referring to the foreign language thing? The guy I was replying to was asking if your age mattered for learning to programming. It does significantly matter for learning a foreign language - If you're below 13, it is extremely easy over time. You have the opportunity to learn it naturally and speak it as if natively. You can learn it as though you're learning two first languages. When you are older than 13, you lose that opportunity and it must be learned as if an academic subject, by practice and repetition. You can become fluent, and speak at a near native level, but it is much harder and a much different process. A kid learning both English and Vietnamese throughout there childhood even if the Vietnamese is only for a couple years 10-13 will have a much easier time than someone learning Vietnamese in their late twenties, even more so late 50s. Likewise, someone learning C++ in their late twenties will have a much easier time than someone learning it in their 70s, but that has more to do with a lower capacity to learn quickly as you age than specific mechanics of language learning that literally close at 13.I'm sorry that learning Japanese will be hard for you and that you regret not being a weeaboo at 10.
Or maybe you are a kid.

That's not asm, that's MASM.
my mom would b proud
under controlled conditionsIn real life an adult is tired from his job, and has shit to do, and is his own boss enough to decide to be lazy on a saturday afternoon.A child has more free time and can be disciplined/bullied into studying even if they dont feel like it. Thus children are better at learning a new language, not because of biological factors, but rather societal ones.

Nice argument. I'll just mark a notch on my wall right here, just for you.There we go, 6 internet arguments won today. Good, I think I deserve an icecream.
masm is a assembler which take assembly code as input to ouput machine code.
i thought everyone knew this? learning a second language or even a programming language is better the sooner it happens. As long as the kid doesn't have full blown autismoness and retardation.
i thought everyone knew this?Yes two fools are arguing it in this very thread.
As long as the kid doesn't have full blown autismonessHow are the going to be a good programmer then?

As long as the kid doesn't have full blown autismoness and retardation.did you forget we are on /g/?
see but yeah, you, the random anon, probably know better than that guyhttp://people.ucsc.edu/~mclaugh/bio.html
he probably isnt thenthats the fucking point.if he's not an autistical autismo autist aut then by high school he can know a shit load if he starts at an early age
That guy is only comparing adults and children biologically, in a controlled environment, without the many chores and hassles an adult would face that distract him from learning shit. The fact is that childhood is a better period for learning because you have more time to learn, and you have people who force you to learn.

I'm an EE student who mainly deals with analog electronics. I am trying to transition into computational electronics, and I think I wanna pick up a higher level language than my current programming tools mainly embedded C. Is rust a good choice?
Keep at it man
Rust, a lot like C, is meant to be a systems language an especially confusing and safe one, that is. Pick something that's higher than those two, if you can.
#include stdio.hint mainvoid {    int i;    int f = i % 3;    int b = i % 5;    for i = 0; i  100; i++ {        if f == 0            printf"Fizz\n";        else if b == 0            printf"Buzz\n";        else if f && b            printf"Fizzbuzz\n";        else            printf"%d", i;    }    return 0;}Programmer babby here, pls help debug. It just prints "Fizz" until you exit the program.
Rust _is_ higher level than C as with most langs these days but it depends how high-level you wanna go. If you want everything with C-like syntax look at Java or C# my personal fave, and if you are a woman learn Python or Ruby. If you still want close-to-metal but also higher level stuff, then look at Go, C++, D, or Rust.
Whoops, posted old version#include stdio.hint mainvoid {    int i;    int f = i % 3;    int b = i % 5;    for i = 0; i  100; i++ {        if f == 0            printf"Fizz\n";        else if b == 0            printf"Buzz\n";        else if f && b            printf"%d", i;        else            printf"Fizzbuzz\n";    }    return 0;} same problem in both programs though.
C# my personal favem-me too, anon. let's fuck.
int i;int f = i % 3; //you _cannot_ assignint b = i % 5; //like this, because i is uninitializedwhat's happening is that since i is uninitialized, it's just using whatever garbage value i holds in memory and since f and b are never updated when i is inside of the loop they just keep the same garbage value i had _before the loop_tl;dr: move the declarations for f and b inside of the loop and it will do what you think it's doing.
Hey cunts I'm making a program in c++ to create bee em pees. The problem is that it should write ints to a file in "binary mode", so it should copy the int into the file the way it is represented in the memory, e. g. 00000000 00000011 11010000 11001000, however what it does is convert the int into a string and writes that to the file, even though I opened it in ios::binary mode.
f & b never get updated. Just replace f & b with the values you have defined above and it should work just fine.
[/code] int f = i % 3; [/code]a- anon you're expecting to much from gcc san!

If you still want close-to-metal but also higher level stuff, then look at Go, C++, D, or Rust.this is why i chose rust. should i stick with rust or jump ship to one of the others?I also need to git gud at C++ in my research and internship, but /g/ said c++ is terrible.
No, this is the jacobian. Consider:Where X is m by n, fX is m by n and gX is n by m, then fX . gX must be m by m. Therefore, dyX/dXij is a matrix of size m x m, and the resulting jacobian is m x m x m x n. There are m x n components to Xij, and each dyX/dXij is an m x m matrix.The output needs to be the same dimensionality as the matrix we're differentiation against.Here's the best I can get to so far:http://mathb.in/36813?key=5e6c205320569cc1d97e5067c3ddbf6a5ada0c3aLooks like posting is finally back.
but /g/ said c++ is terrible.It is, but so is every language. Java is a verbosity monstrosity, C++ is a template mega-hell, etc etc etc and so forth for every single language.Basically, you pick the right tool for the right job and you work around its disabilities.
You mean to tell me I'm not the only one on /g/ who understands this? Bout damn time.
using jz right after you've used jnzKill yourself.
C++ is by FAR the best imperative language. The only good languages are common lisp and scheme though.
So /g/entoomen, I've been tinkering with C++ lately, and I'm wondering if there's any solid libraries for inter-process communication & data passing. I'd like to try implementing a pathfinding server that runs as a separate process to the game I'm making, where the game gives it the localized map data & the start and endpoint, and the server calculates the optimal path. I'm doing this as an exercise in scalability & inter-process communicationDoes anyone know a proper methodology for doing something like this? I'm thinking of using something like Google's Protobufs & just fudge out something along the lines of a async socket handler.
a variable only holds a value. it doesn't hold a "formula" like you seem to think it does. move f and b into the for loop
An application for retrieving the images posted in a 4chan thread. I'm using jQuery and Python through Django for this and I'm planning on adding functionality for selecting images and downloading them in a .zip file.What do you think? Ignore The styling part because I suck at CSS and I need tons of practice.
Right, so after moving f and b into the for loop, it still never prints fizzbuzz. Is this because it divides by 0 on the first loop?
Let's examine this.f && bIn the case of a FizzBuzz, f and b are both 0.0 && 00 is false in C.This is essentially the same as sayingfalse && falsewhich won't be true when you want it to be.f == 0 && b == 0is what you are looking for.You could simply doint f = i % 3 == 0int b = i % 5 == 0to avoid having to write == 0 all the time as well.
What is the correct pattern for functions that create a new thread but must return a value? For example, in Android you can't perform network functions on the UI thread, so you may have a function like "getJSON" which if I could single thread it would return something that the UI thread could use to update the UI, but because of the thread restriction I can't do this.The two approaches I've taken until now are to either hard code the action to be performed where the function would normally return, which is terrible because it creates a two-way dependency, and alternatively passing in a function to be performed as a parameter. Both of these are kinda crap, because I can't test the "returned" value of the function in a unit test.With channels this isn't really a problem, I can return a channel and send the "return" value on it for testing purposes, but not all languages have channels either. Is there some pattern here that I could use?
this is an image board, so what if that fag moot made it for some faggy animu, it's not about that anymore go to /a/ if you want that shit. this is TECHNOLOGY , your animu gfs aren't fucking technology you autistic cunt
You could test it, but this approach is still crap.Callbacks are a terrible way to do concurrent programming.In Java you could make use of Callable, which is a Runnable with a return value.Example:// Execute something that returns 1 in a seperate threadFutureInteger f = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor.submit - 1;// Do some other work on the main threadtry {    // Block main thread until seperate thread is done computing the function and get the result    System.out.printlnf.get;} catch InterruptedException | ExecutionException e {    e.printStackTrace;}Like this the function that is executed in a seperate thread is completly free from threading code.
Yeah, this is basically the same results as using a channel would be, though I think Android would still shit on it since f.get would block in the same way that waiting for the return value normally would, right?
Yes, but you can do work in the mean time, between executing the action in a seperate thread and waiting for its return value.If you need a return value, then you will have to wait for the result either way at some point.If your function only consists of side effects, then a standard Runnable that manipulates the state of its enclosing scope is enough.
mate you realize that he doesnt update the value f in the for loop right?
I'm not sure I understand. What's the problem with doing:getJSONAsyncnew RunnableString {    override onRunjson : string {        this.runOnUIThreadnew Runnable {            //do shit here        };    }}?if you use the rx framework you can do shit like this:getJSON //returns observable.runOnContextthis.context.subscribestr = {// do shit here}in F# async workflows you can do this shit:async {    let! jsonString = getJSONAsync    do! switchToUIThread    //do shit here}
If getJSON is in another class it becomes a mess because the context has to be passed in and you end up with OOP spaghetti and you might want to do different things depending on which activity called the method
because the context has to be passed inWhat are you on about? In the first example, only a callback is passed to getJSONAsync. in the other two examples getJSON returns an observable and a future respectively. There's no spaghetti here, getJSON just needs to know what a callback, observable or future is depending on which technique you use, which is completely reasonable.
Oh fuck, I completely misread the first example, sorry. How would a unit test for that method look though?
not sure how it's done in Java... but in some frameworks I've seen it done like..myUnitTestpromise {getJSONAsyncnew RunnableString {    override onRunjson : string {        this.runOnUIThreadnew Runnable {            if isJsonValid { promise.resolve;}            else  { promise.error"invalid JSON received";}        };    }}}
trying to write a Jolly-Seber capture-mark-recapture model in stan, which requires marginalization because no discrete parameters allowed. lots of posts on the stan mailing list because i'm bad at math and didn't completely understand how marginalization works. this is where I'm at for the probability function. gamma is recruitment, phi is survival, p is sighting. all are probabilities.real state_space_logint[] y, vector phi, vector p, vector gamma {  int ft;  int lt;  int S;  vector[ft * S - lt] lp;  int i;      ft - first_capturey;  lt - last_capturey;  S - sizey;  i - 1;      fort_first_alive in 1:ft {    for t_last_alive in lt + 1:S {      vector[2 * S] sl;      int z[S];      forl in 1:S {        z[l] - 0;      }      fora in t_first_alive:t_last_alive         z[a] - 1;            sl[1] - bernoulli_logz[1], gamma[1];      forj in 2:S {        sl[j] - bernoulli_logz[j], z[j - 1] * 1 - phi[j - 1] + gamma[j] * 1 - z[j - 1];      }      fork in S + 1:2 * S {        sl[k] - bernoulli_logy[k], z[k] * p[k];      }      lp[i] - sumsl;      i - i + 1;    }  }  return log_sum_explp;}
 I'm wondering if there's any solid libraries for inter-process communication & data passing.Boost.Interprocess is designed for communication between processes or threads on the same system.Libraries for communication between distinct systems tend to be designed around a specific protocol e.g. SunRPC, SOAP, etc.
I hope the guy from this thread yesterday is here. But I posted an example of using longs to compare strings as shown below.    size_t len;    if len = strlenop  sizeoflong        while sizeoflong - len             op[len++] = '\0';    long op_l = *long *op;    if op_l == *long *"atan\0\0\0\0" {        op2 = pop;        pushatanpop, op2;    } else if op_l == *long *"sinh\0\0\0\0"        pushsinhpop;It's quite obviously a strict aliasing violation in c99, however the code compiled without warning and worked using both gcc and clang. I changed the code to use a union which is an accepted way to do this aliasing in c99 and c11.typedef union strcmp_u {    char str[sizeoflong];    long lng;} strcmp_t;...    strcmp_t op_u;    memcpyop_u.str, op, sizeoflong;    if op_u.lng == strcmp_t *"atan\0\0\0\0"-lng {        op2 = pop;        pushatanpop, op2;    } else if op_u.lng == strcmp_t *"sinh\0\0\0\0"-lng        pushsinhpop;This compiles without warning and works too. After looking at the assembler I find that the union abstraction is absent and they produce the same damn code which compares the result of 'callq memset' to long constants. Essentially the strict-aliasing violation is optimized out.

s/best/most badly designed/Templates and overloading are powerful, but the fact that it's based on C is bad.There's the C way, old C++ way, and new C++ way. Each way is incompatible.C++ only needs std::vector and std::array because C's arrays are crap.C had typedef but that's not useful enough so they invented using too.C++ had to add lambdas and - type syntax because of limitations in C's functions.

Copy/paste the code and re-run with floats.Add breakpoints and check values of the variables.Compare them.
It would be very hard to tell how inaccurate it is because it depends entirely on your calculation. Floats hold 23 bits of precision and doubles hold 53. See if you can figure it out from there.

this means that you get log10 2^23 and log10 2^53 decimal digits of precision right? i've seen articles mention 7-8 decimal digits for floats but log10 2^23 is only ~6.92. i guess it's just that it takes up to 8 decimal digits to uniquely identify certain numbers, but it doesn't mean that there is actually more than 6.92 decimal digits of precision overall.
You are correct. With floats you only get 7 digits of precision and with doubles you get 16. Use doubles, always. The C stdlib solely uses doubles for a reason, floats are useless.
Also, use long doubles if you can. On modern x86-64 machines they are 128 bits, sothe mantissa is 112 bits. That's 34 digits of precision.
So I'm a C programmer in College, which means that internships do not exist for me. I need to learn another language, but don't want to do C# because 1. M$ 2. I want to try something outside of the C family. What should I do and no meme languages like ruby
I thought some of the things I've done with C++ templates were ugly. Holy shit.I definitely respect the creativity though. Could you post the full code so I can have a fiddle with it later?
rust
I'd suggest Python or PHP. Web dev is really all that's left. If you prefer middleware stuff go with Go.
What should I do when I don't understand a code.Like project examples in programming books.
The strict aliasing rule gives the compiler more room to optimize by allowing it to make certain assumptions.  It doesn't mandate that the compiler produce different code when the rule is violated.  So it's not that surprising that you got the same result using a union: all that means is that the compiler couldn't find an optimization that made use of the additional assumptions provided by the strict aliasing rule.
Then youve gone too far. Go back a couple of pages
Web dev is really all that's leftthis is so fucking sad. I didn't get into computer science to manage databases and work for some stupid social networking site full of dudebros

Financial application: compound value Suppose you save $100 each monthinto a savings account with the annual interest rate 5%. So, the monthly interestrate is 0.05 / 12 = 0.00417. After the first month, the value in the accountbecomes100 * 1 + 0.00417 = 100.417After the second month, the value in the account becomes100 + 100.417 * 1 + 0.00417 = 201.252After the third month, the value in the account becomes100 + 201.252 * 1 + 0.00417 = 302.507and so on.Write a program that prompts the user to enter an amount e.g., 100, the annualinterest rate e.g., 5, and the number of months e.g., 6 and displays the amountin the savings account after the given month.

So... javascript and python and other languages designed for vapid, unimportant, self-important teenagers to be able to upload pictures of their food?
 It's quite obviously a strict aliasing violation in c99Why?Are you aware that char* is allowed to alias anything?
Welcome to modern "software development"Smartphones have fucking ruined everythingIf you're lucky though, you won't be in generic tech start-up #2452 and you'll be working for an actual company doing enterprise shitSo, instead of wanting to kill your co-workers for being hipster faggots who never grew out of college, you'll want to set up a virus to divert fractions of pennies into a bank account you control so you don't murder/suicide your co-workers
python designed for vapid, unimportant, self-important teenagers to be able to upload pictures of their foodKek. You know python is used a lot in scientific calculations / simulations / supercomputers, right?
Not sure if troll or just retarded.    return amount * pow1.00417, months;
char * is allowed to alias anything, but I am aliasing a char * with a long *. At least that's what the guy in the thread told me. It makes sense if you think about alignment becoming an issue, char * don't have to align themselves on long boundaries.
implying someone with a bachelor's degree will be using python for any of that shit
I'm just retarded. Haven't taken any algorithms courses yetI want to vomit everytime some old dude tells me "Smart phones have changed the world! Y'know we didnt have cellphones when I was your age!"Touch screens have made the world stupid
vte isn't an option? What platform?
What you did is a more convenient way of doing it.  The other guys code could be a lot worse.  Just because you did something better doesn't make the other guy retarded.  Grow up dude.
 It makes sense if you think about alignment becoming an issue, char * don't have to align themselves on long boundaries.It may be an alignment violation, but it isn't an aliasing violation.It doesn't have to be an alignment violation. There are plenty of ways of forcing a char[] to be correctly aligned e.g. pointers returned from malloc are guaranteed to be suitably aligned for any type, the char* may have originally been a long[] which was cast to char*, etc.
how do i create a 2d array in C#? i beginner
['C# is shit']
 The other guys code could be a lot worse.Like, how?That's a serious question; show me something even remotely plausible that's actually worse.Calculating x^y by multiplying x with itself y times is just as retarded as calculating x*y by adding x to itself y times.If for whatever reason you don't have a pow function, use explogx*y. If you don't have exp or log, use square-and-multiply.And it's not about the performance. Repeatedly multiplying by 1.00something sucks donkey dick as far as accuracy is concerned.
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2yd9wwz4.aspx
The char* exception only applies for char* lvalues.  Accessing a char* through a long* lvalue is undefined.An object shall have its stored value accessed only by an lvalue expression that has one of the following types: * a type compatible with the effective type of the object, * a qualiﬁed version of a type compatible with the effective type of the object, * a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to the effective type of the object, * a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to a qualiﬁed version of the effective type of the object, * an aggregate or union type that includes one of the aforementioned types among its members including, recursively, a member of a subaggregate or contained union, or * a character type.
m * i^n + i^n-1 + ... + i
explogx,yasymptotically slower, arguably less readableAnd it's not about the performance. Repeatedly multiplying by 1.00something sucks donkey dick as far as accuracy is concerned.Its just a programming exercise.Besides, no bank would store the account balance as a float, they store it as an integer, meaning that your point is moot.
alright thnx how would i fill it with random numbers?
[12, 59826511, 44535, 5643, 199928465, 1456286437, ... ]It worked for openssl.
whats the reference to?
Openssl, in absence of a good source of entropy, uses strings like "use this tring for entropy" to seed its random number generators.
scientific calculations / simulations / supercomputersWhy python? I'd image lower level languages are  a much better choice for calculation-heavy code.
No idea, I was wondering this too. But it's true.

Would you still use Linux on a desktop if you had to pay for it? 300 USD for RedHat ISO100 USD for Mint ISO50 USD for Arch ISOIn this hypothetical scenario, you cannot pirate it.
It's already free and no one uses it.
I don't use it and it's free so no.
/thread
How much for Gentoo?
If the seller offered support that was worth my money.If not I'd probably go with BSD.
70% of the wall street's stock rely on Linux.
Yes, Arch all the fucking way.
Why BSD?
Would you use Windows if you actually had buy it? so no OEM versions forced down your throat
Op, you are missing the pointYou SHOULD be paying for your distroI donate $150 a year to debian and $40 a year to Linux mint I really like cinnamonAll free software is reliant on donations and you SHOULD be donating, even if it is just $2 every time you download an iso
In a heartbeat
I would pay $50 for Windows 8.1 or 10, but it wouldn't be worth it for me to spend any more.I started using GNU/Linux as I grew wary about Daz Loaders and all that.
I would continue using OpenBSD and FreeBSD
I would, yes. I'm more or less a full time Mint/Arch user with the very rare boot into Windows 7 now and again. Over the last 20 ish years, Windows has been nothing but trouble for me, but is required for my work or occasional software I run. My Arch/Mint installations are rock solid, fast and apart from rare exceptions which is usually caused by me, never crashes or fucks up. My forensics/security work heavily relies on GNU/Linux and I'm very impressed with the consistent improvement.Do I pay for Windows? Yes. Do I think it's worth it? No. Paying for GNU/Linux on the other hand? Yeah I would.
No, I'd go with a free alternative like BSD, Hurd, MINIX, Haiku etc.
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#PiracyYou can still commit a copyright infringement by distributing GPL'd binaries without offering source code.
OP here. I bought Windows 8.1 Pro.
rekt
This. I donate $20/mo to OpenBSD and buy the CD set every May/November
I would totally pay like $50 for Fedora, granted all future updates and versions are included.
:^^^^^^
try to donate fedoraredhat sponsors our shit so we don't really need money we need mirror servers and your involvement in the project!ain't got no time for this niggaI saved some money that day.
If it was still free as in freedom, probably yeah. Not free? Then I might as well go to Windows
I wish I had money to donate.
aaaaay lmao
bu-but my custom music players with loli slideshow and tinfoil security
Pls leave eOS dev
Linux is cool and all, and I like that they're encouraging openness, but fuck no I wouldn't pay for it. It's extremely counter-productive to work with, which is why 90% of it's software hasn't changed in 20 years.
just because you paid for it doesn't mean there isn't source code
I'd pay $20 for Ubuntu. I should go donate
kek
Why fix it if its not broken? 90% of the "changes" in most proprietary software is just updating the UI to match whatever the latest hipster design trend is.
arch is the cheapest in the listimplying people would pay money for that broke piece of shit
this
I would compile it from source since it is FLOSS.
I would use a Microsoft compiler lol.
For me, free both as in beer or freedom is hardly my reason to use linux.I start using linux because maintaining windows is pain in the ass no matter how much you put protection and common sense, at some point there will always some idiot who click malicious executable, visit shady website or plug their usb stick on my machine mostly my best friend. The fact that i can run office 2010 on my linux machine is the point where i decide to never go back to windows.
And how do you handle Flash?
I would just use BSD. Or pirate it, I really cant imagine any form of DRM.
Ok, how the fuck do I into SSH?I have two computers both running Linux, and I want to transfer files between them. I'm guessing I should make one a server and connect to it as a client? How do I do that though?They're both on the same network btw.
FTP
SSH doesn't transfer files.SSH allows you to remotely have access to the terminal of another linux computer running an SSH server.
use scphttp://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php
$ man scp
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#SFTP
Ok, so I get that it works like the cp command. But I first need to connect the two computers via ssh right?I can't figure out how to do that.SFTP seems a little too complex for what I'm trying to do here.
sudo apt-get install opensshssh username@ip-address for standard SSH sessionman scp to know about file transfers.
But I first need to connect the two computers via ssh right?noscp username@targetIP:filename /destination
How do I find the IP for the machine I want to connect to though?Do I just use the ip that comes up when I google what is my ip? Sorry for sounding like a retard, I have no networking experience.
scp -rp2C /source/dir user@host:/dest/dir
It can if you use SFTPIt literally means SSH-FTPSFTP != FTPS
scp lets you transfer files via SSHexamples:#transfer somefile.txt to /home/alice/docs/scp somefile.txt alice@someserver.com:~/docs/#transfer from the serverscp alice@someserver.com:~/docs/somefile.txt ~/mylocaldocs/
ifconfig on the computer in questionyou said it's on a local network so it probably starts with 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x
enter ifconfig in your terminalIf you're on the same netwerk you could also do this;name@computernameSo if your other computer is called loonix and you have a user named anon;scp anon@loonix:cutetrap.jpg /folder
this.Why do all people install ftp-servers? Absolutely not neccessary
You should also make sure you have the SSH server package openssh-server on most distros installed and running on the machine you want to connect to.
1. Compatibility with older software/devices2. Stupidity/ignorance
Oh I just figured out you can open streams with VLC if you know the path to a video file on the server.just open network stream and sftp://[ip-of-server]/[full path to file, case sensitive]
Is there something I should be doing on the machine hosting the file?It just stays like this with nothing happening.
thinks /g/ is a tech support boardtoo lazy to google "ssh tutorial"/g/ actually spoonfeeds him
This is just a test of course, I'm not going through all this effort just to transfer a picture.
Better than the having a million mac shilling threads
mate ~/ is your homefolder, so unless you have a folder called elk inside the folder elk, this is not going to end well
why not just use SFTP/SCP?

It's a damn shame that Touchjizz is synonymous with Android to most people... Though Android is still pretty awful. Coming from android user. Jolla when
I can't even tell you the number of niggers I see every day walking around with cracked iPhone 5c's. IPhones and androids are popular with minorities from what I've seen
it's not much of a talent to write down what the fucking phone you use is telling you so of course that's fucking truebut for the most part of it this guy is just a big retard like the kind of person who gets a virus and then complains about the os and stuff like that
I know someone where I work that has a Galaxy S6 and he thinks the galaxy interface touchjizz is the best thing ever.He used to have a HTC One before, I think an m7 and he swears the GS6 interface is way better.He also uses the 'snake' pattern for swiping through homescreen pages, which he has riddled with 100+ apps much like an iphone, and he installed random apps to pull a circular launcher from the bottom corner from anywhere.This is the type of people Samsung markets for.
I'm white, I've used a GS3 since June 2012, and I love touchwiz.I tried a couple other roms paranoid android, cyanogen mod, but I'm currently using Android Revolution HD, since it provides touchwiz and updated android.Genuinely curious why /g/ seems so polarized that touchwiz is terrible, and default android ui is amazing.
For starters he's naive to think that iOS apps don't access the same things Android ones do, they just don't have the courtesy to ask for permissions.
You could actually see who the people using android were because of the Google+I don't remember seeing many white peopleWhite people don't use Androiddarkies btfoEmbrace blackberry masterrace.
you've obviously never used ios. on ios you can use permissions to forbid apps from accessing whatever you want. on android, it's all or nothing deal.
=== You think a white person wrote this?
Google Developer conference was talking about how they're changing the permissions on Android, so it's a moot point anyways

youd be suprise
Replace mentions of "Android" with "Touchwiz" and "Samsung" where appropriate and it's completely and utterly true.except for the app part, that's just dumb.

see cool keyboard as OP pic every dayhey thats nice maybe I'll buy ito-oh, its custom madeguess ill just stick with my black at101w
I have a Unicomp Spacesaver that I bought 8 years ago. The Down key does not work.How do I fix? The spring is still in place and it's not crooked. There's a click like it's striking, but nothing happens.
You can actually buy the NCR 3077, the only custom part is the PCB.
I see. Thanks.
Check the membrane sheet. it might be dirty or has lost contact.
When did you achieve keyboard enlightenment /mkg/?
I don't like those Alps black switches, but I've tried several and there seems to be a significant amount of variation between them. Some feel pretty smooth especially well used examples but others just seem rough and inconsistent and awful.I quickly moved to Cherry MX browns and haven't looked back.
Mine did feel kinda rough at first. Don't notice it anymore though.Maybe I need to oil these suckers up or something. Keyboard is from 1990 afterall.It's too bad there is no custom keycaps for this thing. Would look great on the black housing.
Thinking about buying a Filco Majestouch 2 TKL with browns for work to replace some rubber dome bullshit. I already have a WASD V2 at home.I don't think I can handle ANSI layout due to brain problems so am quite limited in options for ISO keyboards, and this will cost me about €190 or US$205. Am I insane? WASD will probably cost more because of VAT on import to Ireland, shitty exchange rates, handling charges, etc.
Theres talk of more keycap makers doing Alps.
Can't wait!
1990AT101WW's are post Windows 95, and blacks are even later than that again assuming you mean black casing and not black switches - I suspect '98 or later. The first two numbers in the S/N may be the year depending on which serial numbers were used.You can get lube, but that means disassembling each switch.
Keeps revolver + probably all the rest loaded while playing with them
I dunno. Mine says 1990 on the back.You can get lube, but that means disassembling each switch.Oh I guess nevermind that then. I am not truly /g/ enough for that.
If it was that old it would have the old Dell logo,  dye-sublimated keycaps and Alps salmon switches. If it's a W all of that is impossible, as Windows keys only started existing with Windows 95.
Oh, I don't doubt you when you say it's probably 1995 or so. I was just mentioning where I got my original date from.
The top part of the at101w is empty so, if you are a bored modder with one, you could install like a LED screen there or something, or even a Raspberry PI+ screen in that slot maybe.
I'd say it's very late '90s or early '00s at the earliest. Dell didn't start making black desktop computers until some time around then. I don't know when they stopped making the AT101W.Can you post a picture of the label on the back? I can at least compare it to '98-'00 examples.
That picture is not mine. Just found a picture of my model on google.This picture is very similar if not the same to mine.
The 1990 is the year BS British Standard 7179-4 was published.If it has a serial number like that then the second last part is the date code. In that picture 933 = 1999-03-03.My AT102W has a longer format S/N still current format with Dell which includes P/N and country code:MY-093GDJ-38843-07N-1094MY = Malaysia country of origin93GDJ = part no.38843 = factory code07N = 2000-07-23 each part goes 1-9 then through the alphabet, so N = 231094 = manufacturer code
Oh, nice!Thanks for the information. So 1999 or so..Newer then I would have imagined.
Just sold one of those for $40. What a piece of shit.

An old Dell logo version? I suspect they are at least built better than the later examples as they were actually made by Alps later models are Silitek with cheaper plastic, but I don't know how the older switches compare.I think AT101's make good entry level mechanical keyhboards from my experience with later models, but yeah there's so much better out there.
he thinks a gun isnt safe when its loadedi bet youre from europe
Gun safety also involves keeping them loaded so that they are ready when you need to use them. Do you think soldiers go on patrol and not load their weapons until they are being shot at? You must be British.
Oh, it was incredibly well built. The quality exceeded my model Ms. The switches though.... god awful. Scratchy with way too much resistance. It was exhausting to type on, and I use a model M at work and a Unicomp at home.
And yes it was an old logo built by ALPS. I've heard that the later ones have much better switches, so I might try another one some day. I'm kinda burnt out with Cherries and ALPS right now, back on muh bucklin' springs.
My experience with late '90s AT102W's is also "scratchy with way too much resistance" unless it's so well worn that the keys are all smooth. I used one for a few weeks and my fingers hurt after extended periods of typing.I moved to Cherry MX browns and after a year or so I'm still pretty happy with it.I would have thought buckling springs would be similar force-wise to the Alps?
Are Point-of-sale keyboards mechanical/good in most cases? Do you need to do anything special to use them?

It very well could be. I just know between the force required and bottoming out I was getting pain. Not to mention off center keypresses felt like hitting a brick wall. Buckling springs have heavy actuation but are very smooth so I usually purr along at around 100 WPM.
If I want a mechanical keyboard with a Japanese KANA layout, what should I keep my eyes peeled about?

Varmilo with gateron's and granite setGod MD takes forever, at this point I'd rather spend the extra 10 or 20 bucks or whatever to get it in 1 week unless you literally can't get it anywhere else.
Both of those items are made to order I'm pretty sure.Varmilo usually doesn't come with gateron, and the Granite is a group buy so thats normal.
fuck varmilo, fuck gateron and fuck massdrop
upset, friend?
what is a 60% keyboard I can buy in Canada for around $100
 Varmilo has poor QC.Gateron is just another chink ripoff brand.MassDrop is neither part of its name.It's like people enjoy getting put over the barrel by these companies.
Looked up varmilo a bit and didn't see any QC problems. Gateron's are literally high quality cherry's, who cares if they're ripoffs? As if Cherry are the pinnacle of quality, with their pingsAnd yea, MD is pretty shit. Their discounts suck and the bigger they get the less good things I think they'll get. I feel bad for whoever got the po3r weeks after when they were officially released
Varmilo is fine, not something I'd call amazing but they're better than a lot out there.Gateron has very good linear switches, even better than cherry's offerings.MassDrop can be hit or miss but they're the perfect platform for group buys since those take forever to ship anyway.
I'm no brand loyalist. Gaterons just seem like a bad investment, if they had a new switch type, I'd be all about it. But clones, I can't get behind it.I'm not one for linears either, but that is my preference, nothing on their part. As for Varmilo, maybe I just had 2 back to back boards that needed to be return. I'll chalk that one up to bad luck.With regards to MassDrop, I really think they are pulling a fast one. These aren't group buys, they are just pre-orders.
if they had a new switch type, I'd be all about it. But clones, I can't get behind it.I'm sure if they could successfully make a new switch type they would, but the problem is people only make keycaps for cherry stems.Their actual manufacturing allows for much smoother linear switches, so I'd say they really are bringing something new to the table instead of just being "clones". These aren't group buys, they are just pre-orders.I'm pretty meh on their "preorders" as you put it. But they have legitimate group buys.GraniteGMK Triumph AdlerPBT Topre spacebarThey haven't had many but they help save the hassle of a single person having their living room filled with keycaps having to sort out thousands of keys for hundreds of people.
I know /g/ is gonna hate, but I'm thinking about getting the corsair K95 full RGB keyboard with brown switches.I'm just super into that stuff because I'm using my PC in the dark 90% of the time.If anyone can tell me a cheaper mechanical keyboard with at least a few macro keys, I'll rethink my decision, though.Also, does anyone own the K95? How is it?
Go to MD, there are plenty of cheap mechanical keyboards on there.https://www.massdrop.com/r/UUNFVUThat being said Corsair boards are shit and we're not just saying that.Expensive for what you getFast dying/fading LEDsQC issuesBuggy drivers, they crash oftenReally poor quality keycapsNonstandard layout for keyboard so you can't buy aftermarket keycapsLied about 16.8 M colours. Only a few weeks ago did they fix it after over a yearIF you still want to get a corsair board, you're too stupid for us to help.
I don't think I can handle ANSI layout due to brain problemsANSI is better if you can get used to it. Way better access to shift and enter.
Stock UNICOMP Model M here. Looking at either a brown or blue tenkeyless for gaming. What would you guys recommend?
You are right but all three of those would have happened without MD. They are just the pre-eminent GB's right now. MD order fulfillment leaves a lot to be desired.
Green TKL.browns you will find very MEH, blues will feel wayy too light to you.a WASDv2 barebones + custom keycaps would be a good choice.
They haven't had many but they help save the hassle of a single person having their living room filled with keycaps having to sort out thousands of keys for hundreds of people.I think you're underestimating the amount of work organizing full keysets to ship out is. Triumph Adler sold over 1000 units and intelli78 said there was no way he could have shipped out all those sets himself.
IDK that greens would be a good option, seeing as I want something I can bottom out very easily, because I find for typing the M is great, but for gaming, I often miss keypresses.
toprey/n?
sure why not
You probably want blues then. Possibly browns if you want something a lot lighter than what you currently have.
Yes
don't worry, greens are perfect for gaming. you can still bottom out on them easily. since you're used to buckling spring.
The only problem still remaining:macro keysThis is a must have for me, because it made my life so much easier.I currently have a shity non-mechanical keyboard with 19/32 macro key in use, and I really use them every day and dont ever want to miss them.As far as I can see, there are no real other options except corsair, logitech and Razer and /g/ tells me all of them are shit.So what should I do now?
If you think you'll be using macro keys for the rest of your life, you're better off getting one of those small ortholinear keyboards and using it on the side. This way even if you change keyboards you won't have to worry about the macro board.These are fully customizable and programmable beyond just basic macros.
One hour away from me, someone is selling a black Unicomp 104 for $30.Even overestimating the cost of gas, that is still the cheapest mechanical keyboard of any kind around, let alone buckling spring.Do I hoop it?
That actually sounds like a good idea. Thx, anon. I'll think about it.Gonna do some research for which ~100$ mechanical keyboard w/brown switches to get, if anyone wants to suggest me some I'd appreciate it.
No the Data911 is.
Thinking of getting pic related as my first mechanical keyboard. Seems pretty much perfect all around for me but it's also really expensive. So, are there any major downsides to buying used?I hear mechanical keyboards are supposed to pretty durable & last ages, so I shouldn't have any problem with that, right? The only thing I'm missing out on would be the warranty and maybe the keyboard comes a little dirty?Do I have this right or are there other problems with buying a used mechanical keyboard?
No problems with buying a used mech, but there is a problem if the board was shit to begin with.Depends on when the Das was made, but they turned shit awhile ago.
I can get a BTC 5339R-O foam and foil for 5 bucks. I already have a Model M, but could turn this fucker into a nice side project. What does /mkg/ think, worth it?
The Ducky zero is a great option.  Ducky shine if you really need backlighting.
Do it. Sounds like a nice weekend project to modify or do something with it.
Which chiclet keyboard should I buy for pc?Not Logitech
Mechanical Keyboard General
finally found a keyboard I liked that I can get somewhere else other than MD, thoughts on it? also how do I go about changing the keycaps because these are ugly as FUCK http://www.ncix.com/detail/ducky-legend-blue-switch-blue-a2-101153-1049.htm
Pull it off and put on new ones. No trick to it.
sorry I guess I meant are there specifics to the sets like some don't work with others?
Most keycaps are the same so you should be fine.  Some companies like to be special snowflakes and design their products with nonstandard keycaps looking at you, Corsair.
The only thing nonstandard about that keyboard at first glance is the 4 extra buttons in the top right but usually you can get extras. You don't have to deal with any of the nasty stuff like nonstandard bottom row, spacebar, or capslock.
not having a separate left-side numpad
i'm wait for photek's GMK Beige to finally start
is a poker better than a KBP V60?why/why not?
I've been waiting for that one too. I really wish someone would run a PBT dyesub matching the old cherry sets. The one Ivan does isn't exactly the right color.
ivans pbt round 4got a nip key set. cant wait for it
Idk if you'll have problems but I feel that most of the reputation of durability on mechs comes from older boards ALPS, cherries, and of course the only real keyboard - the IBM model M. Das is like everything else in electronics now. Cashing in on a name whilst built as cheaply as possible...
am i going to have to take a picture of my keyboard at Canada Post tomorrow?
Go for it. What kind of keyboard is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO5IaAKTKsQinstalled o-rings yesterday on my keyboard, bought the transparent 1.5mm ones, didn't do much so i installed 2 rings each, got green switches on my razer blackwidow 2014 ultimate, now the keypress is a lot shorter and the keyboard is much satisfying to use, if you have blue/green switches, then i think 3mm rings is a must if you think you need emno more clack, just the click nowgot the keyboard for 1/2 retail price
i love that old beige
10 hour old post but whatever if you're still in here you can check the date codes on the chips if you decide to open it up and take a looklook at usually smaller chips for four-digit strings that may look like date codes such as "9628" 1996 week 28 and similar, but the other anons are right it's probably a mid-90s example I bet it was probably paired with an older poweredge or something like that, the style is too dated for later consumer/business models like Dimensions and Optiplexes
That unfortunate. Prime examples of complicated Black ALPS feel much better to MX browns or clears IMO. They are just very difficult to get and you have very few keyboards available to choose from.
hey guys just got a white faceplate for my kul yea or nay?i think it looks nice. it looks cool at night and i think it will look nice when my keys come in
Black looks better.
yeah I think so too but I want to see how it looks with non black keys. the black keys are really shitty anyway
So far the only keycap colours I've seen that look really good on a white case is Granite/Think Different
I'll take a look at those I just want to mix up my keyboards I've had a black board for as long as I can remember
Here is Think Different on a white FC660M
yeah that looks really nice I have some beige colored keys coming in June so if they don't look nice/feel good I'll look those keys up
Man fuck that PBT shrinkageI'm in the latest batch of granite and I know I'm going to have buyer's remorse.Have people found a way to fix each key with a hair dryer or something? Without the shrinkage they look great.
Have people found a way to fix each key with a hair dryer or something?PBT's melting temperature is much much much higher than anything a high dryer can put out. PBT IS a thermoplastic but you'll need to get to at least 0.6 of the melting temp to reform it at all.
I noticed that board doesn't get a lot of attention. It looks so good in a sea of black plastic and thin bezels. Do most people just want flashier lights and sharp angles?
What are you talking about. Its usually the first board recommended here unless the person is asking for dirt cheap boards.
I mean everywhere in general. Whenever I see people talking about duckies it's always all about the shine and mini with the occasional praise for the premier's keycaps.
I mean everywhere in general.All the places where people actually know what they're talking about highly recommend the KUL ES-87.I see recommendations for it all the time on GH and here. The only place I see that recommends Ducky the most is /r/mechanicalkeyboards but they also recommend Corsair, so that just goes to show how much they know.
I need that beige goodness
MD has a lot of cheap boards. The CM stealth is a good deal.https://www.massdrop.com/r/UUNFVU
As a user fo the corsair RGB range I would suggest you stay clear of them completely. The build quality is meh but the hardware underneath powering the "16.8 million colours" is TRASH. Seriously, they only just released an update to give you STATIC 16.8 million colours. If you want to have animations in 16.8 million colours then enjoy having your keyboard flicker like a strobe light. Seriously, the design is flawed. If you dont use the 16.8 million colour setting then the lighting gradients step so horrifically its like watching a slide show. Seriously. Stand clear. If I were you and you desperately need RGB wait for the ducky RGB keyboard to come out and bide your time OR get a keyboard with white backlighting and get some of the colour changing led covers from massdrop. Again, corsair have baited and switched everyone who bought into that keyboard. I used it for a year and just sent it back with the recent update for a full refund. : Waiting on a Poker 2 now.
Poker 2 with browns
How is the WASD board? I heard the keycaps were bad, but not much about the board.
 https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ducky-shine-4-special-community-editionTell me /g/, is it worth it?

Just get a ducky instead.
What's the nicest numpad /g/?
Ducky is overrated junk.

But fuck do I hate those keycaps legends and I wish the case covered the space under the keys.
Pok3r 3 imo
Based comparison
Ducky Zero Browns for $90USD. good deal?
This
What exactly is wrong with Ducky?
yeah that's basically the main thing I dont like about the pok3r is how high the keys are
In my experience they feel flimsy like cheap plastic. I guess with the right switches caps they are ok. There are so many other good options though just to settle on a ducky board.
Well what better full sized brown for under $150 is there without RGB nonsense? Not discrediting you, just curious as this will be my first mechanical keyboard purchased. I'd like to make it an educated one. I read some reviews that said the Duckies were good, but if you know better please share.
cherry stabilizersinferiorTop kek, the very slight improvement you get in smoothness from a costar stabilizer over a cherry stab is nowhere near enough to compensate for the fact that a cherry stabilizer is 10 times easier to put keycaps on.
If $150 is your max budget, I'd recommend WASD keyboard over a ducky initially.
This No one likes costar stabliziers, they're worse in literally every regard.
How about a $200 budget? I don't mind spending more to get something really good. I looked at WASD but apparently they have low quality ABS caps, though I could just replace them.
Just replace them. Cheap PBT keycaps are better than the best stock keycaps you can get.
I thought that they had an option in their customization section for PBT caps? I'd go with WASD and swap the caps.
What's wrong with 100% unless you have a small desk having the numpad is great
Don't listen to them, WASD sucks. The board is plastic. Get a Kul or Filco.
No one is disputing that the numberpad is great. The problem is if you have a 100% keyboard your home row is either too far to the left of your body or your mouse is too far to the right to be ergonomic.The numberpad really should be on the left side but they're on the right because its a remnant of our days in computing before the mouse. Assuming you're already decent at typing, having a separate numberpad on the left side of a TKL keyboard is easy to learn and much much more ergonomic.
so when's the pok3r gonna be in stock anywhere?
Those are acceptable as well. I just thought for his budget WASD would be a solid way to go. I've had both Ducky and WASD. I can honestly say WASD was higher quality then the Ducky.
Amazon has them I believe.
WASD and Ducky are both junk. He should just forget about his budget and get a Kget a Kul, cheaper than WASD garbage and better.here:https://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=keyed_up_labs,tenkeyless
I thought anon was looking for a full size with browns without LEDS?
Full sized is junk. Leds don't do any harm. Anon should just get a fucking Kul.
Any chance on massdrop doing any 60% cases soon?Got my first mechanical keyboard and I want to start ricing
better quality feeling tradeoff for making it a bit harder to change keycaps every 5 minutes like a 12 year old girlworse in literally every regardkekd
not using clipped stabilizersYour point doesn't apply.
Since you're so insistent on Kul-es-87, can you tell me about the build quality?
Picked this up for 6 bucks at goodwillIts the shittiest keyboord I've ever felt
Same, I rather like the look of the TEX acrylic frosted case. Just kind of looks different.
Yea but for the novelty value alone they're greatI remember these keyboards used for the shitty "hacker" trope in movies."you gotta hack this database""im on it!"take out rolled up keyboard from messenger bag, roll it out, and smash fingers acting like you're doing something
Absolutely tremendous, it's pretty much the best keyboard you can get atm.
GH60,the wait never ends.
Wait, what exactly are the differences between cherry and costar stabilizers?Are cherry stabilizers the ones that have metal bars for the longer keys? Because I find those way more of a pain to remove keycaps from.
No those are Costar stabs
then  is incorrect about the pok3r having costar because mine has cherry.
Thanks think I'll pickup a pok3r tomorrow
Those are costar.CorstarMore even travelMetallic ping when usedAnnoying to removeEasily damagedcompatibility problems with some think keycaps rubbingCherryCan be "mushy" on lighter switches, clipping the stabilizers can prevent thisNo pingEasy to removenot easily damaged
costar stabilizer inserts kept falling out of my shapeways spacebar for my choc mini.. i had to stuff pieces of tape in them and they still came out sometimes. felt so ghetto.costar, never again.
I'm interested in a reasonably price split or ergo mechanical, i.e. $100 or less.  Anyone know of any?  I could deal with it being a kit but pref not.
The only people who like costar stabs are those who buy cheap boards. All the good boards use Cherry for a reason.
pok3rcostarexcept no.
Pok3r with costarWhy do you try so hard to live anon? You clearly aren't good at it.
so now that people discovered the pok3r has volume control capabilities, is it now the best 60% keyboard on the market?
How much would you say you've spent on your "keyboards"?
Why do you try so hard to live anon? You clearly aren't good at it.Unexpected kek.
tfw your keyboard has costar stabilizers but your keycaps don'tMy space bar is unstable af
Why that even bothered anyone is beyond me. Use AHK if you want it that badly.
That doesn't make any sense. Unless you're saying that your costar stabs don't work on your space bar because its too thick and is rubbing.
how easy is it to change the switches from a plate mounted keyboard?ive never soldered anything before in my life, but my dad is letting me borrow his soldering iron and spool of solder.  do you guys recommend a solder pump or a sodlering wick for getting rid of the old solder?
The space bar has spots for cherry stabilizers. The board has costar stabilizers.
You're still not making any sense. Theres no such thing as spots for cherry stabilizers vs spots for costar stabilizers.What you could be talking about is nonstandard stabilizer locations, in which case either your original keyboard has nonstandard spots or your keycaps have nonstandard spots.
I'm a shamefully slow typer and am considering getting a mechanical keyboard and making a serious effort to practice.It's really really embarassing, I'm an employed software engineer and I can't even touch type. I've read the pastebin, is the reccomended list up to date? Looking for something that looks nice in my home office, have no practical budget limitations.
Yes its up to date. Some keyboards are older and harder to find but most are still around to buy.You're probably looking for a switch like browns if you're a software engineer. Long sessions of typing feel better with lighter switches and blues get really annoying quickly if you spend all day typing.Most of the boards in the OP have browns as an option, but there are also plenty of other good options in MD.https://www.massdrop.com/r/UUNFVU

And the 980 is a rebranded 8800 GTXWhat else is new
AMD & AMDPOORFAGS ARE CHUUNI AS FUCK
so amd is bringing out ONE new card? thats gonna cost over $900?the rest is literal rebrands at higher clocks?hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
And Titan isn't chuuni? Hey, at least it's better than GAMING BRANDED ULTIMATE xxXxS3PHIROTH_APPROVDxxXXx
I called that the 390x would be a rebrand like 6mo ago OP, you should listen to me more...
390X  is only 0.3 terfalops better than the 290Xreally
And Titan isn't chuuni?no its notif you actually know shit that isnot shilling for nvidia either
yiff, hell, etc
Fiji aka Fury only have 4GB of HBMrebranded the 290/290x with 8GB of GDDR5re-rebranded the rest of the seriesNvidia are evilsAMD are incompetent
I've had a 980 since thanksgiving. feels gud to know amd is still shit a year later
I don't know about you, but I'd rather spend my free time with Darth Vader than JarJar.
I know this is bullshit, but I want to believe. I really do.
My fanboy following of AMD/ATI died out in 2011. Went 3770k and 960 in 2012. I will need to replace the GPU in the fall before Oculuse/ReVive, and I will get the best I can afford. I'd be happy if AMD came out with a winner, but I have no more allegiance.
just wait till the new cards come outI've been hearing this and delaying my 980 purchase for months for this shit?
Same... Wtf man4GB HBM at 1k+ is insane and retardedWtf is AMD thinking?Rest are rebrands, I guess the extra 4 gigs are nice, but not worth the money really...Damn, I wanted to support AMD, I really did, but they are goofin' it up
If AMD fucks this up, it's over. They won't have enough money to keep on going and they will have to get bought out by another company or go bankrupt.
nvidia has a highend GPU monopolyFuck me
Dubs are truth.
I hope they don't; I mean, brand loyality is stupid, but a monopoly certainly doesn't benefit the consumer. And NVIDIA are already getting arrogant and deceptive...

but all the news who was rumored from expreview, sweclockers, videocardz and wccftech was true...
There will be no monopoly. Someone will buy out them. If no one will want them, nVidia and Intel might buy them out and restructure them and then then sell shares at a loss.This might even benefit AMD, just so old managers would be replaced.
Yes, it is. But it can be interposed.

The non-Fury 390/390X will not be pure rebrands, but 290X respins with 285 tonga/gcn 1.2 texture compression, tessellator count, and if they have any sense more L2 cache.GCN is a pretty solid fundamental design, but AMD mistargeted some component allocations with tahiti that are pretty simple to fix after making tonga.
Problem is I herd that the X86 license goes out the window once AMD is sold to a new owner.
nice to see that fix, but I doubt I'll upgrade from my 290X for that.
NOPE.AVIIt's straight up rebrand, it even shared the same device id as the 290/290X
Why would you need texture compression? Isn't the 290X not bandwidth starved cause of 512bit bus?
Fury = 4GB HBM = 1k+-390x = 8GB DDR5 = 600-700Right?Hmm, I don't know, I hope the 390x destroys the 980ti...But a 1k priced card with 4GB - even if it's HBM - seems a bit risky.The 390x might be worth it, if it out preforms the 980ti, and costs less
believing some stupid website no ones ever heard of beforeis AMD really dumb enough to make a rebrand of a rebrand???
nah Fury = 4GB HBM =  899$390x = 8GB GDDR5 = 599$
280X was a rebranded 7970, 290/X was new.
390X is only 0.0000003 exaflops better than 290XWOOOOOW
 believing everything you read on currynigger clickbaitWhy would you need texture compression? Isn't the 290X not bandwidth starved cause of 512bit bus?depending on where they do it, texture compression could reduce cache contention, and smaller memory transfer times mean smaller compute stalls and less complexity for prefetching/scheduling units.
I don't know exactly how x86 license works. Does it cover merging, buy out, reorganization, etc. All nVidia and Intel would do is reorganization, they would gather new board of directors and restructure the company.I bet there are ways to do it. Intel and US government will make it work, either by giving out new license or bending the rules.
Yeah it does, but the buyer might strike a new deal with intel on the license, because if amd loses x86 license, then intel will have a monopoly and that might be a fucking nightmare for themIt's much better having shitty competitor than a monopoly
Hopefully their new driver improves performance a lot. The new beta 15.XX drivers that were just released removed a lot of the driver overhead AMD  is known for.
The driver INF doesn't lie, faggot
same architecture and fab process.SO NEW!!!
900 bucks for a 4GB card lmao. amdcucks BTFO
Its non transferable. In the event of amd buyout the license becomes void and null
mfw 290x 8GB tri-x = 390xwhat a fucking joke
so most likely, AMD will just have majority shares sold to another company, and will be run through proxy.
 not knowing that gpu vendors have in fact made up intentionally misleading shit in driver configs in the past
Meanwhile over at NVIDIA people wonder how they passed WHQL when their drivers crash chrome.
Heh
It's ok when AMD does it :^
600$ for card I can get for 400 right now. And I know it's possible, last rebrand was like that
rebranded the 290/290x with 8GB of GDDR5re-rebranded the rest of the seriesNvidia are evilsAMD are incompetentactually its the other way around, the 290x is almoast 3 years old and its still able to compete with the 980.And currently here in Norway the 290x is almoast twice as cheap as the 980.And since hawaii is so powerful, amd can just make small adjustments and rebrand the cards.Now if the 980 had double the performance or even 25% higher overall performance, then sure it would be a good card. except for the fact that its so expensive relative to the performance increase.hermg
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUURYYYYYYYYYYYYY
290x is almoast 3 years old and its still able to compete with the 980.not even close m8
There is no 8GB HBM1 so you better stop believing.
Maybe he meant to say 970
but 780ti = 290x
why is that?can't you just have what  pic does, and make multiple stacks?
The issue is that GPUs have been stuck on 28nm for three years and probably another whole one too and that no more ALUs can really be added at this point for both cost and thermal reasons.Color compression and stupid tessellator tricks are about the only thing vendors had left to do, so that's what we saw in the last generation.
are you smoking some really really fucking good shit.  You can pick up a 980 for 500$.....
Vader is Lawful evil. Nvidia are neutral evil.
Oh boy.
yes, but not with 8GB of GDDR5
They don't even have to buy them out,  restructuring with Intel help will do the work.There are ways to solve this problem.
Not this guy, but the 290x does trade blows with both the 970 and 980.
mfw it's actual true.
he thinks nvidia has worse drivers then MADyou should probably look into grey screen of death friend, nvidia MAY crash chrome for you, but MAD drivers crash many computers on a regular basis, and they prevent you from checking error codes to boot!! whoooo hooo.... I love me some MAD cucks
If it's true = first day purchaseAnd insane sales for AMD
No one remembers Ati Rage? What with all this ironic shitposting about card name?
tfw neither amd nor nvidia have anything worthwhileintel just released yet another 2500k sidegradeno upgrade for the next decade.i dunno man, quadfire 295x2 is a breddy gud high end value proposition.
That's not true, HBM1 is limited to 1GB per stack. There's a higher density version of HBM1 as well. These are specifications provided by Hynix. GCN is not limited to 4 stacks either. At least no one has provided anything to back that up. Does that mean this card will be 8GB though? No, not necessarily, but the opposite is possible as well. There's too many rumors to really be sure about either 4GB or 8GB, or the possibility of variants.The chink lies part was the 600USD pricepoint. I don't believe it because AMD has stated they don't want to be the cheap brand anymore and they're directly competing at the Enthusiast Level with the Titan X which suggests it will be cheaper than it, but not that much.If it actually does turn out to be true, Nvidia is going to have to drop their prices down something fierce. Not holding my breath though.
I have a 980, and I can max out the most recent games at 4k, check and mate amd shill
dat relentless nvidia shill drivel
you mean 2 x R9295x2? or 4 cards, because that's impossible.
I wasn't saying it was better, only that the extra cost partly comes from the extra VRAM
yes, it's referred to as quadfire aka 2x 295x2 which is essentially four cards in two casings.
he didn't even look up grey screen of deathgo ahead, I'll let the light shine in on you OP
not arguing that. i completly agree. they are stuck and are doing the best of it, sure the amd cards use more power, but they are on par wiht 970/980 for a much better price.
OP
because 76% of people have nvishit cards
having more users would cause the term crash to show up less frequently unless, you know, it crashes like a bitch.
if true they well sell like hot cakesdoubt it though.
he thinks more people = less problems
for me "AMD driver crash" is the 4th result"NVidia driver crash" is the 3rdseems close enough to call it even.
I'm trying hard to comprehend this chart but I really can't. Charts make us stupid.
dat mental gymnastics
I wish people would start calling cards as 'GPUs' and vice-versa.Cards are not GPUs, GPUs are a part of the card, a GPU doesn't have to be a on a card, and in fact the majority of GPUs out there are NOT cards.

I'm wondering if all the wait for this card is AMD evaluating at what price they should sell Fiji XT/Fury at.If AMD wishes to undercut the 980ti as well as the Titan X, then maybe 600USD isn't as unbelievable as it seems and they were just waiting to take the thunder out of the 980ti all along.
autism
Would you prefer they'd call it VGA?
I wonder when 8 way crossfire will be possible. I'd love to have 4 dual gpu cards for no logical reason other than muh powa
should probably get on that nvidia bandwagon if all you care about is power bb
all the idiots in this thread not understanding the significance of HBMonly care that its 4GB not 8this board is full of tech illiterate retards
he thinks MAD has ever done anything good
I can understand their issue with the 4GB amount, as HBM won't fix the issue if applications need more than 4 GB of VRAM. People are looking for the next big card so they can make the jump to 4K
thinking people are here for fury and not for the 390xyfw the 390x is the rebrand of the 290x
explain please. i dont fully understand the impact it will have, for all i know it can just be another marketing gimmick that provides litte performance gain.
It's great and all, but it doesn't change the fact there is only 4gigs of it.
AMD FuryWasnt the ATI Rage/128/MAXX a complete failure of a product line?
Its incredibly fast
this, most of the stuff I'm running in 4k wants about 6.7 gb of VRAM
please elaborate:
it has been established that the 390x is an upgraded 290xnow we can move on and talk about Fury
oh, and HBM isn't going to magically make that number less, just saying...
its in the OP you stupid fucks
+50 MHz of OCsame power house architecture+4GB of GDDR5upgradedI'm the OP
rumoredyou fucking piece of shit
[citation needed]
I don't give a fuck about all this, my HD7970 is running fine, but AMD is presenting a bunch of Bullshit -.-' A rebrand of a rebrand ? Rly?
nigga, are there benchmarks there? any way to actually know for a certainty?Yeah i get that part, but isnt the main issue gpu speed and not memory speed/latency?
He thinks amd is a "power house"
do you need me to define the word "upgrade"?
If AMD wishes to undercut the 980ti as well as the Titan XAren't they on semi-official record as saying they don't want to be the "cheaper alternative to Nvidia" any more, or at least this cycle?980Ti is guaranteed to be somewhat slower than the Titan X, and the Fury or whatever is all but guaranteed to be at least a little faster than the Titan X, so I would be amazed if the Fury doesn't MSRP for $700-$800.I just want a tonga-fied 290X with HDMI 2.0/DP 1.3 for a non-insane price.
you must be new summer
Graphics cards and graphical processing units are an interchangeable term for the masses because people think of them as the whole unit.The card/PCB which has everything on = unit, to most people.
he thinks the 7970 doesn't have massive problems, ie: grey screen of deathand you must be a fucking dullard
so how many different products has wccftech claimed the 390x to be now, 10+ different products?i don't disagree necessarily, it just means i won't be purchasing an upgrade anytime soon.
tell me a single reason why not to buy twin Sapphire R9 290X TRI-X 8GB instead of anything from the 3XX lineup
https://www.google.de/#q=rebranded
If they aren't calling it something like Olympian or Zeus, it's wasted potential.
So is AMD kill?
Telling lies on the internetNo game needs 6.7GB @4K unless you run completely unrealistic amounts of AA that are only playable with three Titans or something.
yes
I think memory bandwith constraints is a big issue for all gpus. Having ram this fast allows amd to use some cleaver tricks to increase performance to something in the effective range of 5/6gb. Still not 8 gb though :
Rebranding only applies when the product doesn't change. But english isnt your first language so I'll give you a pass.
No game need more than 3.5 in 1080p unless you run completely unrealistic amounts of AA that are only playable with three Titans or something.
I can screenshot my gta V settings if you want MADbaby
Never said that it doesnt have problems.. But mine works perfectly, and when it dies, my old 5870 will have a comeback

both are 2816 core hawaii
it's only going up from there, anon.
No that's not how it works. The X86 licensing was for the 8086/8088 series.
OLD pic
On 1080p you need shittons of AA.On 4k you don't need AA.The VRAM requirements for 1080p with 4xMSAA are almost identical to 4k without AA.
So 770 is not rebranded 680? Phew, I though nVidia rebraned their GPUs for a second.
The guy on your picture is pretty cool.
well here is hoping! if it beats the 980ti by that much, it has to be good.Btw since memory is that fast, will it help in regards that it only has 4GB, but fast 4GB for 4k? or will it still be bottlenecked?i mean fast 4GB might work as good as slow 8GB?
wccftechconfirmed Ease pick one faggot
Its using the 15.xx catalyst beta drivers.  Cant be all that old.
rebranded 2xxthe new gpu is furyAMDead
nobody ever said nvidia doesn't do rebranding too
It's possible they could have meant cheap as in cheaper and slightly less performance in the same bracket see 290X vs 980. That's unlikely though and bordering on mental gymnastics though.More likely though, If they undercut the 980Ti at cheaper price and better performance, it will force Nvidia to drop unless they're too prideful. So that actually would make AMD the more expensive more powerful solution in the end like they want, but they'll get more sales that way while still being able to shake the "bargain brand" image some people have. Or rather the image other people impose on them.
On 4k you don't need AA.depends on the screen size. 4K should still benefit from 2XAA at 24 inches. anything above isn't really needed though.
it's the 1st benchmark in the web about Fiji, this shit is old
at 4k you WILL be bottlenecked by 4gbthis, I'm on 4k on 24" and need dat 6.7 gb of vram
moooaaarr ramIsn't the AMD meme supposed to be mooaaar coresWhy do you idiots keep spewing the same shit unironically about vram? I plan on only playing at 4k, so I'll take the faster vram thank you, especially if Vulcan/dx12 pooling actually take off
there were people who actually thought amd wouldn't disappoint once again
So it's confirmed that the 980 Ti will wipe the floor with non-Fury AMD cards right?
I wonder if Vulcan/DX12 will support VRAM type mixing. Like HBM for most stuff and GDDR5 when you need more space.
At 2x the price, perhaps.
why would you delete that wonderful postMS makes open source packet manager for Windows 10. No one cares.
HBM only gives increased performance, once that 4GB is filled up and the program still needs more, that performance advantage is gone.
at 4k you WILL be bottlenecked by 4gbnope
Can you link different cards in DX12?
with 0 AAlaughingwhores.tiff
being disappointed by the $399.99 Titan killer last year.
TitanTitan XTitan X Blackbut it's okay when nvidia does it right?
in theory yes. I think only Vulcan has confirmed that though.
Amazing argument, a game that came out months ago BARELY manages with 4GB
There is no card that can run GTA V with 2x AA @ 4k.Kill yourself
Titan killeryou amd cucks will say fucking anythinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWMG8xiXIYg
AA  at 4kDo you know what AA is? Cause actually increasing the resolution that much kinda negates the need of it.
Only problem there are already games that use ,ore than 4gigs when available. If DX12\Vulkan is what they say they are, memory usage will go up, not down.There is not reason to AA 4K content on anything but really big TVs.
I run with even more then that bb, once again, I CAN POST MY GTA V SETTINGS IF YOU FUCKING MAD AMD BABYS WANT
see
GTA V is worst caseother games need lesswhat game is that supposed to be?I play at 25fps
FXAA at 4k
is rumoredplease learn to read
it's not even from a reliable source anyway currytech is a rumor mill
CoD:AV
Higher is better
ITT nvidia shill cucks getting btfo and scrambling
meanwhile Nvidia users playing the shit outta Witcher 3 while amd gpu fags pcs are crashing world wide
he thinks its nvidia getting btfo not MADcucks
this
Higher is betterWhat the fuck is COD doing to eat up all that VRAM?
Op this is old news FIJI is going to be named 4xxThe 3xx are oem versions of the 2xx series
AMD fag status:BTFOfeels good being nvidia+intel masterrace.And to think when I made my first build few months back I was considering amd... heh.
he doesn't know, yet, guys. Should we tell him?
tessellated ocean under the WHOLE WORLD
If they can bring out the 4xx series this year, I'll be alright with that.
I'm on a HD5850 and I'm going to buy a new computer.Should I wait a little more for HBM? I'm pretty ok with my card, but it's clearly showing its age.
You're kidding, right?
Shit was crashing all the time on my 970.I'm pretty sure it was hairworks crashing it  but I dunno for sure yet.
preloading every single texture in the game at once.
you should just pick up a 980, for 500$ you can't go wrong
Shit was crashing all the time on my 970.I'm pretty sure it was hairworks crashing it but I dunno for sure yet.MEME CARDhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdwUsalwBJ8
I doubt it's doing anything useful with it.many game devs are incompetent fucks and publishers don't give a fuck about PC ports, so we take what we can get.4Gb is not enough for Top Tier card, that has to fight 12gb TitanX, not from futureproofing, not from marketing perspective. This is why I think 4gb is just a rumour.
It wasn't a meme card when I bought it, you ebin memer
It's intentional because gaymers equate "runs bad" to "good graphics".That's because they know shit about graphics. Many actually believe dynamic lighting is the same as muzzle flash for example.
I actually just moved to Europe, so I have no idea about the cheapest prices here.Is there a place where I can look up?
sorry I'm an amerifat I don't really know any juro prices
AW is literally designed to use up all the VRAM you have. You can even change the percentage in a .ini file. Many people have just set it to 80%, doesn't change how the game runs at all but your memory usage drops by 20% just like that.
FIJI is going to be named 4xxsauce
I thought that was Crysis 3.
which country, nigger?
lol these videos never get old
Netherlands
Crysis 2.
If muzzle flash is a light source and objects cast shadows based on this source, it might be DL.
tweakers.net is basically the best site
Thanks anon. The prices of the components are insanely high here.No way to get cheaper?
Nope, welcome to jew country.
XPFirefox 20 or soframesno wonder
shop elsewhere in yurop mategeizhals.at/eu has german, austrian, polish and uk stores if i'm not mistaken
Is it ok for me to buy from other EU countries? I saw some cheaper prices in germany.
Yea, once it hit the EU borders, the import taxes have been paid for. Not completely sure on the VAT though.
try to play Prototype 2 on 290Xlags, unplayableforums say AMD has no driverstry integrated intel graphics 4770Kno lagAt least my house isn't on fire.
Fucking yurop. I also have no idea how VAT works here.
Answer me this MAD fanboys, when was the last time AMD released a driver, not betas... an actual release? last year?????
Still deciding on whether to get the 290x or the 970, hell I could probably afford the 980 when the new cards are out.

6 year FL veteran using Ableton Live for the last few months. Here are the pros and cons of FL and Live. FL Pros: can run 32 bit and 64 bit VSTs customizable can move the upper tiles aroundcan export to MP3, WAV, MIDI, OGG Live can only do WAV and AIFFEasy as fuck to manage VSTs at least in FLS 11, it's fucking weird in 12Automating and modulating is really easy, but hard to finetune. That fucking amazing idea where FL studio records the last 15 minutes of your play session so if you made an amazing melody and can't recreate it, you can dump a MIDI log onto a pattern. Probably my favorite feature of FLS. sidechaining is a lot easier, although to be honest i cheat and use Gross Beat. FL Cons: Sucks assdick with hardwareWay too many fucking steps to map MIDI channels You have to have multiple Instances of Kontakt open to get multiple sounds from itdid I say sucks assdick with hardware? It REALLY sucks with learning MIDI CCSome VSTs you have to click out of the window to hit space and make the song stop/playrandomly latches notes Really hard to choke hihats to make them sound more realisticLive Pros: easy to master your songsdat 8 band EQ Works really well on multiple monitorsdoesn't lag and skip as much when opening really large VSTs/patchesWorks AMAZINGLY with hardware, digital and analog. Don't have to put everything into patterns THEN into a mixer, you just make patterns from the mixer. Personal opinion here. Auto quantization when playing, especially useful when performing. I don't know if FLS has this feature or not. Making templates has way better workflow in my opinion. Those master sends are awesome. Quantizing and warping and looping audio samples is god damn 10/10Live Cons: Can only either do 32 or 64 bit VSTs unless if you download a shitty third party wrapper that crashes constantly. I forget the name of it. Arrangement isn't as fun.Cont.
I don't like the interface, feels a lot less usable than 11 imo. Last time I tried it all my VSTs were gone and I didn't want to bother reconfiguring it all.

Hey look, a non agressive thread. Cool.
FINALLY a proper MPV threadHype for shader
link to commit I can't find it
How to use them? What section of the manual are they in?
your welcome bb
can i use deband.glsl with main mpv? if so, how?
Deband.glsl is on mpvhq branch
Append :source-shader=path/to/shader to your VO line.
whats so hard about adding:source-shader=~~/deband.glsland just trying it you chucklefuck?
Would there be interest in a script for mpv or an option for youtube-dl to display annotations as ass subtitles, keeping the same way they look on youtube's player?
I just didnt know if it was supported yet, thanks m8s
Have the official Windows builds stopped being built? The last one was on the 5th. Should I switch to mpvhq?
I would use this

https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/4d6b9550fe1e0354461716f560d71d78196d5da5It was actually two days ago.
lachs0r is a lazy fucking idiot jewboi, who just asks for donations on his website, and he only does updates when he "feels it adds something to windows" the build in OP gets updated every time haasn makes a commit at least
Cool, the only thing I found when looking for this was a not too shitty srt converter but being srt the subs don't look at all like they should and a really bad converter to ass made by someone who didn't really understand how ass even works. Gonna start the project sometime next week I think.

Not him, but absolute paths are just easier to visualize and remember for me.
gui when?possibly soon, using cocoausinb cocoacocoaDropped.
https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/man/vo.rstsearch: source-shader
Also not the same guy, but relative location never works for me.
then your not doing something correctly, friend
how do you slow down temporal dither? I liked it at first but it moves too fast
Opening post should be updated to include the next big thing they're working on: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/tree/display_sync_wipAlso, wm4 said he plan to make vo options settable in runtime. It's not an immediate priority but I'll wait eagerly for this, vo_cmdline just sucks.
I was reading when they were talking about it in IRC, I just thought shaders weren't out yet hence the OP, but apparently I'm just late to the party
I was doing something stupidly wrong actually. Forgot that mpv reads from your home director and not .mpv.
mpv is the best media player available on GNU/Linux.I'd just like to take this chance to thank the developers for their hard work. You guys are the best.
:^
guess i'll try it out sometimekinda doubt i'll switch from mpc-hc though, been using it too long
Haasn bb if you are here, are you going to continue working on mpvhq even though shaders are now in mainline
What is that script?Seems pretty neat
just because your used to something doesn't magically make it better
https://github.com/onodera-punpun/bin/blob/master/neetpls msg me if you have any problems.
bruhwhat are some good j/k-dramas about high-school romancebasically generic romance anime in a real form
Not haasn, but as far as I know he said he plan to use mpvhq as a sandbox to push things that he like to play on, but may or may not make their way back to mainstream e.g. sphynx.It'a great player and I find it better in nearly any way, but not necessarily it will give you enough reasons to switch, especially on windows.Np, I'm just glad we could finally have a decent mpv thread.
Thank you based anonSo i guess currently i should compile on my own to use shader isn't it?This is my mpv versionmpv 0.9.2 C 2000-2015 mpv/MPlayer/mplayer2 projects built on 2015-05-19T07:07:47ffmpeg library versions:   libavutil       54.20.100   libavcodec      56.26.100   libavformat     56.25.101   libswscale      3.1.101   libavfilter     5.11.102   libswresample   1.1.100I'm on arch btw
What's up with the '~~' ?So why can source-shader only take one shader? I can see why scale-shader do, but I don't understand this one.
~~ is = to "use mpv's current directory" ie where the executable residesand I know what haasn said, just curious if its actually going to continue
home directory?
I don't really watch high school romance, pretty much ever kdrama is is romance driven though.Here are some romances I liked:* The Heirs is really popular and generic as fuck, I liked it though. It's about a poor girl and a rich heir.* Heart to Heart is about a hikki girl and her douchey psychiatrist.* Protect the Boss is about a secretary and her douchey boss.* Good Doctor is about an autistic doctor literally and another doctor.Yeah probably, there is a mpv-git in the AUR.
thanks bud
no thats incorrect
How do I use that?I set my media directory, and created the files neet uses.Now I get:No episode match found[...]
pls update your script: https://github.com/onodera-punpun/bin/blob/master/neetand send me the neet -d output
Same here. It's a great media play
He's put up a new build everytime I've asked him. He's made it pretty easy for others to do it themselves, too.
doesn't refute that he's a jew
I can see why scale-shader do, but I don't understand this oneI actually can't see why also scale-shader only take one.

~~ is = to "use mpv's current directory" ie where the executable residesWrong. ~~ refers to the mpv configuration directories all of them, in fact.It has nothing to do with the current directory nor with the location of the binary which is most likely /usr/bin.So why can source-shader only take one shader?It's hard for more than one to make sense; I decided that more than one is most likely going to cause trouble. If you can come up with a compelling example for wanting more than one source-shader I could reconsider.

I set up SASS and following this guide  http://www.impressivewebs com/sass-on-windows/  and it works fine. However, if I close the command line then it stops compiling to CSS. It's obviously a massive faff to set it up every time for every file, how can I make it so that any SASS file within my Projects folder is automatically compiled to CSS whenever any changes are made?
What you're searching for is answered in the form of a task manager with a sass module and a file/folder-watching module.recommended task managers are either Gulp or Grunt. Both have 'sass' and 'watch' modules, and plenty of youtube walkthroughs on getting up and running.
Ah, okay. I was going to look at Gulp tomorrow, glad to know it just so happens to be the solution to my problem.
Definitely.I'm migrating my projects' task manager config from grunt to gulp. In my opinion it'll be the more future-proof one. Definitely explore other modules and figure out what all it can do for you, shit's magnets.cheers

Rewriting an in-house web server to Express. Should be a lot less obfuscated and maintainable.
making an AI that monitors/learns all public API requests
Tell us more about that.
Making a home page to advertise myself and try get web development work around the place.  Any tips on it?
Any tips on it?Nah, but trips.
I made one. I'd like to share the 'app' I made, but since the site uses my name and has personal information about me, I can't. I guess I should probably just buy another domain and figure out how to use the hosting service with the 'external' domain, since I can host 2 more sites on my package.
I'm working on one right now that involves a full screenshot of each page I've made in a scrollable div box. Its super incomplete but I think it will turn out cool.
Good web developing is programming. Shitty front-end that only touches on HTML and CSS is basically web design.If you are using object literals, arrays, function callbacks, etc, you are doing programming.
give me a website to make
This has been bothering me too. Im learning backend, but cant think of any simple ideas that doesnt involve 99% of the project staring at docs
codemonkeys can't think for themselveshire an idea guy
Reminds me of my last year of highschool a year ago, we had to make a game for out final, and my friend who has no idea what the fuck he was doing, cant understand a variable was paired up with me. I asked him what he wanted to do on the project, and he said "I wanted to be the idea guy"I always thought "idea guy" was a meme, but apparently he thought it was a job title
good thing I'm not a code monkey XD
Ive been studying HTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP, MySql, Wordpress and bootstrapalso dipping my feet into the Sass pre-processor. Ive made about 3 sites. Can I start applying for web development sites yet?
Short answer: yes.Long answer: there won't be many companies willing to hire you or take you as an intern, but if you won't try, you'll never know. Also, people usually don't really remember the names they see on the resumes, so even if you get rejected at some place, it doesn't mean you can't apply again a few months later.
what can i do to boost my hiring chances?
install gentoo
Learn a framework like Django or whatever. Even if it's one that's different from the position, they all have a ton of similarities and are a very powerful, possibly necessary tool for large sites.
Why do people keep telling me to avoid PHP? I see tons of PHP job openings in Europe.
If you wanna make it easy for yourself download Koala or LiveReload.
because it has a reputation of being a horrible language, and because it's used by a lot of startups and other far-from-great companies.
I thought Laravel was all the rage these daysKilled RoR and all
Brit here, same issue, I am just starting all the Treehouse courses, and in a week or 2 I reckon I will be ready to move onto either Ruby or PHP.While asking on /g/ it seems obvious that the choice I should make is Ruby on rails, but all the job listings here are PHP.Any advice appreciated.
How come /wdg/ has so much fewer nodevs than /agdg/? It's like a small miracle.  Hope I don't jinx it.
I don't mean that "no serious work is done in PHP nowadays", as it's still relevant and powers a lot of the web. It's just that PHP has gone a long way and had a lot of pitfalls along, so there's a lot of people for whom PHP = all the evil and they'd rather get a job trimming satan's asshole hair than writing PHP code.
Might have something to do with it being much simpler work
don't listen to those phagsfacebook was made with phpif you're good with it it's great
I wouldnt necessary say that webdev is simpler than sharing FizzBuzz and Hello, World! programs in Python and C.
Not really. If you take Kenny's assets and an existing game engine Unity is pretty much the magicky Rails of gamedev it is barely, if at all, harder. Hell, with Phaser.js gamedev _is_ very much like front end dev.
FizzBuzz and Hello, World! programs in Python and CRead careful. The original post said "agdg", not "dpt".
carefully*
Oh, my bad.
hope you didn't subscribe to that page.Daily reminder that you can dowload any teamtreehouse/tutplus/laracast/codeschool/learnable/lynda/amazon book using torrentz.com
Because people post mostly interesting projects here. Interesting things are usually not what the average client wants you to make. You can use templates all you want, but something more creative does in fact constitute programming.
What is a nodev?
Not-developer. Mostly refers to "designers"
so whats the stigma on no-dev?  why is this a thing?
No clue.
Not-developer. Mostly refers to "designers"That's incorrect. In the context of AGDG "nodev" means someone who talks about development-related stuff but never does it. They are also often implicated for shitposting and being "idea guys" with ideas that are no match for their poor skills.
Oh, I see.
Have you ever met an idea guy by the way?  They are REALLY annoying.
Not that I recall.
am I the only one that worries wordpress is making web development obsolete? if you need something , theres usually a theme or plugin for it already.
People with actual ideas don't tend to call themselves "idea guys".
Yes, because Wordpress seems to be dying slowly
from my observations, thats not the case. Wordpress seems to be brought up every single time someone says they want a website. I often see people working on wordpress in my coffeeshop. Maybe its a different demographic from the type that would visit this board, but it seems heavily in use and demand.My girlfriend's companya health non-profit just paid 20,000 for a wordpress site.
Treehouse video on javascript"Here we have our name in an object, but we can edit the object so it says, my name is *** but I wish it was Rainbowdash".Am I learning Javascript from a brony?
gamedev is more difficultunpleasant to work with, lower wages, significant possibility of having 16-year-old beginner programmers on your teamthat's because zuckerberg dun goofed and didn't order a rewrite in a different technology as soon as he earned some money and the codebase was still relatively small. now maintaining that monstrous php pile of shit php costs them tens of millions every year, and they waste a lot of the money trying to fix the platform HipHop, HHVM and now Hackwordpress is making web development obsoletenah. also see picrel. ignore that jump in the beginning of 2015 because that's obviously due to change in indeed's methodology for counting this shit
wordpress is making web development obsolete? For people who make one-off sites for local small businesses? Maybe. For medium-sized businesses whose value/product/service is mostly delivered through their website? Not in the slightest.
Its used by enterprise companies because it can be reliable, but it is slowly becoming less popular for smaller companies, because there are better options
Yes, stop now and watch your videos on Lynda.com, where you can enjoy the smooth voice of Simon Allardice
Why are you learning from a video? Go read some docs on MDN or, better yet, find a book.
Some people learn better by watching than reading. I know I do
From what I've seen of Javascript tutorials it is hardly the most informative material, but point taken.
I do agree that most of the popular "tutorials" out there especially JavaScript for some reason are not worth watching. They show you bad techniques and hacks around things, but there are a good few ones. Ive been looking for Node.js tutorials, but the video ones are awful, so I am forces to really look at docs for hours figuring out small things sometimes
Small things  like what, if you care to share?
Haha, mostly just HTTP methods/RESTful APIs. I should understand it, since I was in school for IT, but for some reason I just couldnt get a hold of it. Starting to grasp it now though, just a lot of reading and failed implementations
Hey guys.Have decided to plunk down 700+$ on a nice laser helmet.They were just approved by the FDA to treat hairloss in men.The other two FDA approved treatments Rogaine & Propecia certainly do work.This isn't a scam right?Just wanted some opinions from other before I order it.
lmao
You realise the FDA evaluates public safety concerns, not for accuracy of advertising unless they overlap. FDA cert means effectively nothing
why you censorin shit?.
Hmm... I see.They did do controlled studies though which seemed to show a positive effect from the laser therapy.I dunno.Just ignore that.
now this is pod-racing!
just ignore that

Display driver errors with Nvidias new 352.86 driver?Anyone else seeing crashes only when using Chrome with display drivers? There's an 8 page thread on Nvidias Geforce Driver forum of people with the exact same issue screen goes black and the display driver crashes then recovers every so often whilst browsing chrome.9804690K8GB RAMWindows 8.1Any known fixes?
Any known fixes?Stop using the botnetStop buying jewvidia
Yep, 970 here, same issues.Using firefox for 1 day now, no Display fuck ups yet touch wood.It'll be fixed soon enough, must be a conflict.buying AMD to avoid driver problems
to be fair, they can't have problems with what they don't have
Display driver errors with NvidiasNvidia confirmed for no drivers! Nvidshills BTFO
no drivers.
Literally no driver problems at all on omega or 15.4 here.They even crashed gracefully when i was testing overclock limits.
inb4 OPs card catches fire
link or it didn't happens.
Friend of mine who has a 970 has the same issues with browser crashing
Nvidiadriver problemshahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Looks like its effecting all maxwell at the moment, my little laptop 930 does the same thing, rolled back to the old ones for now
Use 350.12 driver. Tons of people are reporting problems with the new driver.
Weird that it happens on laptops, it's not like the browser is using the discrete GPU
no probs here with latest drivers w 750 ti, the old 350 was causing a bit of probs for me, nice b8
But Nvidia's drivers just werk lol
I rolled back to 347 after trying the 4 or so most recent versions in between. Don't waste your time with newer drivers unless you got that Witcher or GTA5 to play.
It does when you have the GPU on all the time because optimus is a heap of shit.
It's a definite issue with chromehttps://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/833693/geforce-drivers/nvidia-driver-352-86-stops-responding-and-kernel-reloads/8/Some type of conflict with Chrome it seems
b-but it's just some crashes they will fix it SOON!!!AMD perfectly working drivers = no driverTop kek Nvidots logic everyone.
Why has this thread turned into an AMD/Nvidia shitflinging war?Both companies experience driver related problems, denying this is retarded. Nvidia are simply more consistent with their driver updates.Also, getting same issue with chrome. Use firefox OP
he fell for the Nvidia has better drivers meme
Nvidia are simply more consistent with their driver updatesMore like having to build 2 new drivers everyday to fix some retarded bugs, fucking incompetence.AMD drivers never crashed or burned their card.
using botnet browserthere's your problem
970 g1 gaming here,no problems.maybe you should reset your unstable oc first.
No OC, what browser do you use.
Yeah, but at least i didn't save a thumbnail.
he fell for my baitAlso why are you namefaging without a tripcode? Whats the point?
Firefox.
inb4 100000 fried cards again
 get called out on rookie error quick, better recover by calling it baitTripcodes are for jerks.
Well fucking read the thread, the issue is with Chrome.The driver itself is fine, it's just some wierd shit conflicts with chrome causing the driver to fuck up briefly
Also, people can impersonate me, which is kinda fun.
falls for my ebin bait :^quick better call it a rookie mistake :^:^But people hate tripcodes because it destroys idea of anonymity. The reason people use a tripcode because they are verifiable. If you just use a name you're still going against the idea anonymity, only now people can impersonate you like so. Why have the worst off both?
Maybe it's bait?Also, it's not a real name now, is it?I can't even remember the last time i saw a tripcode that wasn't on /sp/
Yeah I suppose you're right. Its just unusual to see people using names without trips outside of [s4s]. So I wanted to ask why.
poorfags aside, Titan here and the current driver crashed 3 times since its release.something is definitely wrong.
hope you like your 1000 dollas deep fried
$1000 dollarydoo cardno driversStay mad Nvidiots
Yea, i've had a few crashes today.It only happened to me when using chrome. I've had instant crashes to desktop playing Witcher 3 but it doesn't seem like a driver issue no 'Driver Error' message when the crash happens and seems more like a patch related issue 1.04 is said to have terrible stability.Using firefox so far and no display crashes as of yet.
I have no problems with this driver but I'm running a 670
You gonna have a 1 grand paperweight soon.
nvidia puts out certified drivers all the timethey are unstablemight as well be beta driversamd has not put out a certified driver in monthsthey have only put out beta drivers in that timestable as can beGG
I have random driver crashes rather frequently with the latest NVIDIA driver versions, yes. Not a  particularly big problem for me, but a somewhat annoying one.
I d-dunno what y-you guys are talking about, atleast nvidia HAS drivers... unlike AMD... s-stay mad poorfags. Pic related, my battlestation.
didnt crash in 2D for me yet but twice in video games and once in AutoCAD.screen went black for about 5 seconds then the driver rebooted and everything went on as if nothing happend.
Why do you people spend so much on on shit that fucks up so often?  Not even saying this in a  mean fuck you way. Just wondering. It seems like more trouble than even worth. I'd rather get some 2 year old GPU or some shit if I had to. But whatever. probably your parents money anyway. Most working people on their own wouldn't buy thats hit
Nvidia has no drivers.
It's happening to everyone but only in Chrome.Bandaid fix is to use Firefox for now.
i have both firefox and chrome installed. i use firefox 99% of the time and every time i get this error my firefox crashes as soon as the driver recovers. i'm thinking it's an issue with hardware acceleration, turned it off today and havent had a crash since but that's not saying much as the crashes were infrequent anyway.
same. it's been pissing me off too
Yes. 780x2. Downgraded to the GTA5 driver and I've been fine ever since. Me and a buddy actually had a crash at the same exact time as well and found it pretty funny.
Tighten the woodscrews on your gpu, I heard that works
Not with chrome but there is a1/10 chamce that the Witcher 3 will cause this on my machine
Titan x here, no issues.
It will be fixed next set of driver.

When I download torrents from e-hentai, I never get an indication of how many actual seeds are on the torrent like the on torrent from nyaatorrents under the e-hentai torrent. This makes downloading stuff from e-hentai almost impossible if the torrent has hardly any seeds and when I finish downloading it, the torrent shows as if it has no seeds or peers at all pic related again. This is only happening with e-hentai torrents I'm seeding a load of stuff for private trackers and it's all fine.I've logged out of e-hentai, cleared my cookies, logged back in reset my torrent key and it's still broken, is this an issue my end, or e-hentai end or somewhere inbetween?

I just got a new phone and this thing can't connectWhat gives? it tells me it can't connect to gmails serversHow can I fix this?
I opened the back and there doesn't appear to be a slot for one.
If you use prepaid, you'll be restricted from making phone calls when your balance is 0.
Thoughts on Solaris? I am new into systems and I am curious about it. Is it relevant somewhere? Has it ever been?
If you made a call the minutes will be charged based on the plan associated with the SIM, or taken from the value of the pre paid card. Otherwise all calls will be rejected

So I picked up a tube of Arctic Silver 5 that finally came today that I was gonna use to replace heat paste on my desktop, as well as mine and more importantly my dad's new thinkpad.I've read a lot that I should have gotten something like MX-4 though because of the cure period.Should I pay an extra 8 bucks and order a tube of MX-4 instead? Also, what's the best way to apply this? I know that mobile CPUs apparently need to have more coverage of it
I know that mobile CPUs apparently need to have more coverage of itu wot mangmobile cpu's usually don't have internal heat spreaders and you put thermal paste on a bare chip which is small as fuck. Put a tiny pea of paste on top of this shit and slap the heatsink on.Stop being a pussy, it's just a computer not a woman.
I'm no expert, but as I have understood it, don't overdo it, but don't be afraid. It's just supposed to be a reasonably thin layer like paint.
Fair enough. I'll just use the AS5 I have and go for it. I have never screwed with laptops before.Just apply a rice size amount and plop down the heat sink right? Pressure should even it out and all that jazz I believe

I'm using Protonmail.
The model of trusting ANY 3rd parties with all your most sensitive data in the form of emails is bullshit.Openmailbox, GMail, lavabit, whoever else, it doesn't matter. End-to-end encryption is the only way.
FUUUUUUUUCKKK and that after all the shilling for Openmailbox from /g/.
Yandex Mail. Who gives a shit if the Russians look at your email after all. They're not going to collaborate with US authorities or their allies.
listening to /g/ adviceI bet you also have meme OS installed.
Well shit. I was using a different french mail service, mailoo.
just use outlook you fucking autists
WTF? I thought OPM was encrypted.
This.Not using protonmail2011+4Shippity Doo Wop Hip Hoppity Hip
I'm still on the waiting list, but as soon as I have access to it I'm switching to Protonmail from Tutanota
Protonmail is pretty great. It's annoying that you have to use 2 password, but you get used to it.
Digging up ancient shit here.
just got account today :^
2013Fuck off
Have you read the whole post, moron?The Law came into force like a moth ago.
Fuck, I just migrated all my shit over to Openmailbox a month ago. Should I just go back to gmail?
No, dumbass.Use fucking Protonmail.
If you're not encrypting shit yourself on your own machine with PGP and expecting it to be secure, just fucking get off of the fucking internet already. Fucking christ, you idiots.
To be fair, Lavabit shut down after being asked to give up the keys.
Give me one good reason too. I literally have nothing to hide.I did sign up for protonmail though. How long does it usually take to get in?
nothing to hide argument againfeel free to publish all your secrets since you have nothing to hide and shit.
You might want to take a look at Swiss data retention laws and Switzerland's history regarding network surveillance.It always makes me laugh when being based in CH is used as an argument for privacy-oriented services that aren't banking and even that is dying now.
I know, it's a lie. I do have a lot of shit to hide. Can you please answer my second question?

So use gmail?
Someone start a thread on HN
up to a moth or so because of the high demand atm
Zero Access ProviderEnd-To-End EncryptionYour emails are automatically end-to-end encrypted inside our email service. Because of this, we cannot decrypt or share your data with third parties.You can believe that or not.I still prefer them over Gmail.
Most countries have or will soon have data retention laws and Patriot Act-esque powers to spy on people. Literally the only thing you can do is pick services in places that hate the West, like Russia or China. Sure, they'll look at your files, but they're not going to care. If someone has to have them, it might as well be someone on the other side of the world who hates your government and won't share.
What's HN?
I think he Jews around by saying the databases are encrypted but not the Mails themselves. Pretty shady either way.
Why did you not listen?https://archive.rebeccablacktech.com/g/?task=search&ghost=yes&search_text=openmailbox+online.net

Fine with me.outlook for personal, another for work.gmail for general unimportant shit like forumsopenmailbox for mailing list spam
This is such a stupid fucking argument. I guess everyone should just be able to walk into your house and go through all of your shit at will then. Because you have nothing to hide.
I just deleted my OPM account. Back to Gmail till I receive my Protonmail invite.
So, I thought about some very interesting things that will allow us to bypass this law and, by the way stopping to keep logs  while keeping  control over our infrastructure. I keep you in touch. I'm going to read some legal documents to see what location is preferred.Seems the admin is about to change the country of the servers
The Netherlands has no decryption order. The government has been talking about it, but the idea has been shot down before by our parliament. And the criminal prosecutors have already said they don't like the idea. And the council of judges said it might be against our human rights right to remain silent.The Netherlands is a bit of a wild west in that regard. Yes, they can spy on you. Yes, you can protect yourself from being spied upon.
I'm going to read some legal documentslel this really sounds like some kids are in charge there.
I say just go with cock.li. No personal info at all required, just username and a password.
I can't use IMAP with protonmail.
 does it really protect you like users claim it does? what's up with the whole waiting list and everything? how long will I have to wait to get an account?
does it really protect you like users claim it does?It's supposedly a clone of Lavabit.So, yes.how long will I have to wait to get an account?It took like 2 weeks when I registered.Could be faster now.
why exactly does it take so long to register?
NSA honeypot. They need time to do background checks and document people applying for something that would generally attract people with something to hide.
I asked for an answer, not some faggot to shitpost.
HURRRRThey don't have endless server capacity. It's also still in beta.
Mans Got a point
ah. thanks anon. that makes sense not wanting to overload the servers. I can wait till it's out of beta.
Openmailbox is worse than Gmail at this point.no. It's the same thing. Google is worse since they do a lot of other things that openmailbox can't.
 Pick a mail service located in a country that won't cooperate with governments that you're particularly concerned about privacy from.
mfw I have a riseup account and use TextSecure
Housewife News.
OP, can you read ?Our servers are located in France. If requests is legal, I give the informations.which means that if a judge ask him to give informations about a user, he will give them. And I'm sorry to tell you that but it's normal.
what the fuck. are you fucking serious? fuck the jews. I just got a new email and was using openmailbox. fuck everyone and everything. i fucking hate people so much
There's no such thing as a private email service. Why would you ever trust third parties with such a thing?Nothing is stopping you from setting up something like PGP and using it to encrypt messages both ways. You just have to ensure the recipients of your emails will agree to use PGP as well. At that point, it doesn't matter which email service you use.
Have you forgotten to take your meds again this morning?
 OPRiseup.I only communicate with people that use pgp.All non pgp mails automatically get replied with instructions to use pgp.
no, just memeing. but i really dislike business people and government
It was advertised on Fox News, so I wouldn't be surprised. lavaboom.com is aiming to create a similar "zero-knowledge" design. It will be interesting when it's done.
 openmailbox owner literally says "i dont encrypt, why should I, I'll just have to turn the contents over to the authorities if they ask" leave gmail for thisDon't trust /g/, anons. You were fucking stupid to do so
They implemented encryption last yearhttps://www.openmailbox.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=4
/g/ could not have foreseen this new French law being passed or the owner admitting that he doesn't encrypt mailboxes. It even claims "encrypted data stroage" on the homepage which was very misleading. As far as we knew it was a good alternative until now.
It doesn't even matter if they use encryption or not, since they will instantly hand over any data if asked.
Cock.li with PGP is bascially the best thing everprotonmailmfw waiting list
cock.li is hosted on ColoCrossing, so it's basically shit. Enjoy your failed delivery notifications.
Every respectful/lawful ESP and ISP is obligated to do this by law to avoid liability. They can request to squash subpoenas, but that's a different thing and not a search warrant. It's also a different thing if they will actually do this or not.
Fuck this freedom bullshit now I have to switch all my internet accounts over to gmail because I'm done switching email. Protonmail is going to be kill soon
At that time, FSF still endorsed Gmail although they had a warning about PRISM. I knew at time of posting  that they had removed it, but that's not shilling.Note the post date and actually read what the Wayback Machine said until around July 7, 2014.[1] They did endorse it, as quoted below.Gmail: You can sign in and use Gmail without non-free Javascript, but you have to make the account in a special way, through https://accounts.google.com/NewAccount. This is an old sign-up form; the currently recommended sign-up form is no good, since it requires nonfree JavaScript code. But Gmail is run by Google and was specifically named as part of the PRISM spying program.[1]: https://web.archive.org/web/20140707032110/https://www.fsf.org/resources/webmail-systems
The Admin admits that he fully collaborates with authorities.What a fucking twist. You're not going to find any legitimate company that does not.
This.I'm using protonmail, but I still encrypt on top of their software. At this point, you should just assume that every email provider is compromised or will be in the near future.
Why you post here if you doesn't like our service ???- adminQuality service right here.
ThisI don't even care anymore. I'm sick of changing shit around.
The real problem here is the new law in France.http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/france-mass-surveillance-law-news/However, the bill’s authorization of bulk metadata collection with almost no oversight from the judiciary closely parallels the Patriot Act’s language, which has been used to justify the NSA’s most controversial spying programs in the United States.The French state can force providers to hand over data whenever they like. That makes France one of the worst possible locations for such a Provider.
have  your name and address in whois if you ever want to get a domain namehave your e-mails labeled as spam by every major service for the rest of eternity
I understand why you're astonished, everyone in Europe know what's up with France and wouldn't trust it, but you're american.
You really think any e-mail from a fucking .tk domain will make it through ANY spamfilter?Also you're avatarfagging.
WAAAAHHHH i cant send illigal things over the internet wahhhh wwwwaazssaaahhhhhhhh
As long as you follow best practices and your mailserver IP-addresses are not blacklisted, you should not have an issue with .tk domains.
IMAP is for niggasAre you a NIGGA anon?
HAHAHA I fucking called it:https://archive.rebeccablacktech.com/g/thread/S48026498#p48027215
that's why a lot of french companies are thinking moving their servers to another country. see https://www.openmailbox.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=1269So, I thought about some very interesting things that will allow us to bypass this law and, by the way stopping to keep logs  while keeping  control over our infrastructure. I keep you in touch. I'm going to read some legal documents to see what location is preferred.
Anyone who used openmailbox for something more important than a forum account is a fucking retardEspecially if banking stuff. For that you use gmail, the government boogeyman will get everything you do either way and at least with gmail you're sure your stuff won't be fucked with by a couple french kids
So should he risk his freedom because some fuck is doing illegal shit?
I'm moving all my accounts back over to my gmail. It doesn't even matter anymore to me

tl;dr Need good beginner Android dev. resources.Sooo I'm an idiot and pushed back a class project, and I only have like 5 days to do it now. It's completely reasonable to achieve this, but I'm sort of unmotivated and unsure. The project is a web app that connects to GAE basically, with features and menus, etc. I have an idea already but I'm lacking the training and experience. What I need is good beginner resources for Android / Javascript / GAE. I've tried looking for my own but I'm not really sure if they're any good or not, and I'm not overly thrilled by it.
What went wrong, /g/?
Did it ever even go right?
I thought the Moto X was good?
They made the transition to smart phones too late and they constantly try to make US production work. Also generally making bad smartphones to begin with.  There was never a huge expensive flag ship that was appealing to get lots of profits.
They were doing alright when google owned them.g was full of moto g shills
yeah remember when this was greatyeaaaah
Moto XgoodSummer 2015still running Kit KatThey forgot what brought them into the spotlight after years of mediocrity; timely updates and a near-stock experience.
tfw Google announces Android M and my Moto X doesn't even have Android L
They sold it to chinese instead of focusing on making high end devices manufactured in the United States of School Shootings to prove that not anything has to be chink made.Now the only company that keeps on doing that is Blackberry, which manufactures their device in Joselandrip in shit memerola

falling for the MacBooks are overpriced meme
Custom built 5K PC = 3,690$The fuck? i built a 1,5k $ computer and I can run GTA V in 4K 120 fps.
falling for the Mac Pros are overpriced meme

do you know of a cheaper 5K monitor than the dell? 2.5k right there
the dongles don't have the speed that the macs AC has
I never understood the point of iMacs.Apple laptops are great. I used plenty of them since the titanium powerbook. The Mac Mini is pretty neat. It's a true SFF full-function PC that fits nicely into any environment. But what is the point of an iMac? It's a laptop in a desktop form factor that doesn't really provide any space saving over small windows boxes using desktop components.
who the fuck caresthat's like saying if the mac came with a dildo you would have to go buy a $500 dildo seperately
EVERY other Apple product is overpriced and very underpowered compared to the whole competition EXCEPT the 5K Retina iMac which is underpowered but not overpriced because of the unusual low price of 5K monitor.
And it's not like everyone doesn't already have a dragon dildo anyway.
Fuck off with your shitty guideYou are a colossal faggot
June 2015It's still MaySo you're going to spam this shit for the next coming month?

First custom built PC: Motherboard $200$, Windows $140, $242 for that monitor?Get a grip, man...
the term you're looking for is debunking. and it's not spam. this is the only thread and i'm in it discussing it
motherboard is $200 as it has thunderbolt. if you can get windows for less go for it derp. that dell monitor is on newegg and has speaker and webcam
Drop shadowNo safezone controlPastel instead of Pantone 2012Didn't even try with weightingsHoly fuck 0/10
No, you posted the start of the guide and literally everyone told you to fuck offThen you have posted it daily since, despite the fact that nobody gives a shitBlatantly shilling Apple products like a true macfag
custom built budget PC$240 monitor$200 motherboardBluetooth not included in a $200 mobopaying for windowsWi-Fi not included in a $200 moboFuck it I won't go on. This entire chart is BULLLLLSSHHIIIITTTTT
Custom Built Budget PCWindows: $140But... OS X is free
people clearly care and read it or they wouldn't be so butthurti have no idea what any of that means
find a motherboard with thunderbolt and bluetooth and wifi ac then and i'll put it in. monitor has speakers and webcam, which are $75 seperate
Thunderbolt is pointless for the large majority of Windows users and the only reason the motherboard is so expensive is because it's proprietary niche Apple crap. You can get an excellent motherboard for ~ $1001080p 24" monitor with speakers appears to go for around $130 and you can choose whether or not you want a webcam which would go for around 20-25 bucks.Windows 8.1 costs precisely $99,99 on Newegg which is the site you mentioned.I just saved 190$ on your crap build estimate without really trying.
midrange PC for 1770$750GT1440 monitornah
You add a lot on extras on the windows builds, but you seem to have forgotten to add to the macs the cost of dildos, beads and anal lube
Custom Build midrange PC$600  screenCustom Build High End$2500 screen$3700 overall budget
I don't understand why you care about what other people buy? How does it affect you how much money Apple makes, or how many aluminium toys they sell?Have you honestly got nothing else to do than try and convince some NEETs to buy Apple computers?
windows 8.1 pro was $140 on new egg. got a cheaper 21. 5 inch monitor? The mac has thunderbolt. so if it's available on PC it would be biased not to include it too
I'm amused someone wasted that much time on those silly charts.  Then again, they were probably paid to do it.
Who the fuck cares about thunderbolt and 802.11ac? Who the fuck bluetooths a device to their computer? Plug the bastard in so it doesn't die have some common sense!Nigger you don't need 802.11ac to have wi-fi! Mode a/g is faster than most people's home internet!.Since when is having a webcam a necessity?These ARE NOT things you put in a BUDGET build.Most people's home computers are several years old and are worth less than $400Most people don't give a shit about any of that, much less know what it does and why it would be needed.Fuck's sake I have a $700 dollar PC, a $150 monitor, about $300 in audio the receiver is by far the most expensive bitFor your "budget build" cost my computer outperforms it by leaps and bounds.
i don't want needs to buy apple computers. i just want them to understand that they are not overpriced anymore. I'd actually rather ugly people not use macs to be honest. My primary motivation here though is to have fun
it's only took a fraction longer than perusing the product spec pages on the websites
if i didn't include all those things it would be biased. If you don't want fast Wifi AC? fine don't include it. it shows you it's $75. Just subtract. magical
/g/ is serious business you nigger
Literally the first result for UP2715k other than the fucking Dell website is $600 cheaper than OPs priceDo your fucking research next time OP
doesn't bluetoothI'm sorry you're poor anon. Would you like me to listen to you go on about how CRT monitors are actually superior to LCD, and not just because you found them in the garbage?
that's what you're here for. link to website
what research are you talking about? OP is a third rate shill trying to jew some shekels out of newfags
If Ferrari were to make a $400,000 three-wheeled car, it would probably be the best three-wheeled car ever made. That does not make it a good car. All three-wheeled cars are shit. No one is stupid enough to make three-wheeled cars, so Ferrari has no competition. Even though it goes 0-60 in 7.9 seconds and flips over on corners, it is still the best three-wheeled car out there. Now imagine Ferrari fans saying Ferrari is awesome for making the best three-wheeled car of all time, ignoring anyone who tells them that all four-wheeled cars blow Ferrari's new car out of the water. They believe the gimmicky form factor means the car doesn't have to compete with any four-wheeled car.I think you can see where I'm going with this.

I have no need to bluetooth anything to my PC. I use it for handheld-to-handheld file transfers  and playing music at work. WoopdeedooYou don't need a 3Gbit capable wireless card and router unless you do home networking NAS to multiple devices simultaneously over wireless.The faster mode doesn't make your internet better than what you pay for. It's pointless outside of specific needs which most people don't care about.Mac shills are scum of the EarthBut you need this product!It's going to work faster because the higher numbers!But it wouldnt be faaaiiiir to not include itYou're telling me that a "budget" option is $1,100USD and I'm telling you that you have a really fucking warped view of other people's priorities.
People telling me to remove things from the PC that the Mac hasno one commenting on the $50 budget for PC case
whats that addon called? it better be for firefox
I have decided to give up on OP and his shill ways. Have a nice evening, fellas.
Yeah, it's too expensive.
damn right it's hard work. link to a site with pricethis is not about what Anonymous #713598y794 wan't in his PC. it's about comparing iMacs to PCs with equivalent features
oh so you've already heard of it
who doesn't do home networking? every apple fag has a time capsule or nas and an apple tv for starters
Can a mobile GPU really drive a 5K display?
I know you're baiting but I have an iPhone 5 and have never owned any of that shit

THEY ARE STILL OVERPRICEDMACBOOK PRO THROTTLES AT 0.8GHZCANT DO SHIT ON ITYOU PAID $1000 FOR A LAPTOP THAT GOES AT THE SPEED OF A RASPBERRY PIGOBACKTOFUCKINGMACRUMOURS
Iris supports 3x4k, so why not.Doesn't mean you'll be rendering anything in 3D at above 10FPS
peer reviewed journal article please or you;re talking shit
equivalent featuresAnd that's fucking wrong. You want equivalent PERFORMANCE, not equivalent features. The majority of people will literally never use Thunderbolt, especially in the PC world, so including it makes literally no difference to experience.
subtract the price for your own needs. the guide is just a unbiased look at Both in comparison with no specific individuals needs accounted for
MACBOOK PRO THROTTLES AT 0.8GHZThat doesn't mean it's like a Raspberry Pi. It's the same clock speed, but the MacBook will be vastly faster even at that clock speed.The Pro is still utter garbage, though.Journals don't publish product reviews, moron.
link to multiple reviews with benchmarks showing it running at 0.8ghz under load then
the guide is just a unbiased look at Both in comparison with no specific individuals needs accounted forThen the price to blow the entry-level iMac out of the water is $600, because that's what I spent on my PC and it beats the iMac in every meaningful respect.
 using one 5k monitor instead of 2 4k ones for half the price
unbiased
https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3739174wow so hard to find
FOR YOU
I never claimed it gets to 0.8 GHz under load. That's a different Anon. I would like a review, too.I don't know why you want a review, though, because you clearly wouldn't know what to do with it. Anyone who seriously thinks peer-reviewed journals publish hardware reviews is CLEARLY not knowledgeable or intelligent enough to read a detailed review.
macpoor general
i could find a dell shooting dicks out of the cd rom on support forums too. anything that can go wrong will go wrong. why does the pro beat the rest in benchmarks?
it was an elaborate ruse to suggest you find a source that wasn't possible. as what you were claiming wasn't possible in and of itself
it's about comparing iMacs to PCs with equivalent featuresThe features aren't equivalent. All the custom PCs can be repaired or modified by the user. NONE of the Macs can.And that feature is a lot more important than a Thunderbolt port no one uses.
yes but if i only showed all in ones on there /g/ would just say they can built a custom build for cheaper
You demand sources but provide none of your own.From my previous post:I never claimed it gets to 0.8 GHz under load. That's a different Anon. I would like a review, too.Are you unable to read? I never claimed it throttles.And you seemed to believe journals publish consumer hardware reviews, which is even stupider.You're legitimately retarded. You can't use le funny rusedude maymay to get out of your previous idiocy.
Unbiased my ass.Your charts are literally useless.
From my previous post:it was an elaborate ruse to suggest you find a source that wasn't possible. as what you were claiming wasn't possible in and of itselfare you unable to read? it was a jokeAnd look at any tech review site. the macs are always 9+/10 on there so i assume they do well on benchmarks
how is it biased? the case is too cheap isn't it? should i find an aluminium case?
Doesn't need to be aluminum, just needs more LEDs.
Sorry but any retard can look that it's macfag propaganda.Go back to sucking dicks instead of making shill charts.
1. it is debunking the macs are overpriced meme2. How is it biased in it's comparisons? Genuine reasons will be addressed. it's only version 2
are you unable to read? it was a joke1. I don't it was a joke.2. If it is true, you're retarded because you are talking to the wrong person.3. If it is true, you're retarded because your joke was stupid and accomplished nothing.You demand the other computers match every single Mac feature while the Macs fail to meet several key features from the other computers.Find a single Mac as repairable and upgradeable as a PC tower. That's right, you can't. Yet you put a $200 mobo in a budget PC in order to get Thunderbolt support and claim that you have feature parity.
Because you make every computer match every single feature of the Macs while not requiring the Macs to match several important features from the other machines.
i will add a disclaimer then. unfortunately i can't add "serviceably" to the mac. but i can add thunderbolt to the PC
Compare the actual performance of the computers and not the specs like a retard.Don't compare useless features.Stop rounding up to 00s, it makes your shilling look way too obvious.Computer components are not priced at $50 you fucking moron, fuck your lies are way too transparent.
This.The lies are fucking obvious.Fuck this Macfag trying to justify wasting his money.
1. how would i compare performance? isn't listing specs doing that?2. considering3. are you unfamiliar with how to round? if it's 5 and over you go up. 5 and down you go down. i don't go up every time4. considering specific models of webcam, mouse, etc with specific prices. they do sell apple mice and keyboards separate you know. should i include them to remove one aspect of difference between the comparison?
No one uses Thunderbolt.Posted from my Macbook Pro.
he fell for itlook at him and laugh
thread moving to /48221877
Could i say something like this at the top:DISCLAIMERS:Apple products have no serviceably/upgradability. Custom builds have no service/support and require assembly.
how would i compare performance? isn't listing specs doing that?Quick, which is faster?GTX 750 Ti:2 GB GDDR5640 CUDA cores1020 MHz base clockGTX 770M:3 GB GDDR5960 CUDA cores811 MHz base clockThe 770M looks better, right? More memory, more cores. Just a slightly slower clock rate. The 750 Ti is faster on most real-world gaming benchmarks, though.
nobody on /g/ thinks the M one is faster
It isn't accurate. Custom builds have support for individual components and Apple products do have some limited serviceability and upgradability.
That's because there's more to it than simple specs can tell you. The 770M's little two-line summary of 3 GB and 960 CUDA cores looks better than the 750 Ti.You can't sum up a component with two numbers.
audioNone of the guides ever have any recommendations on this. $50-100 recommendations on audio for my family computer build?
Someone post the picture of the guy with iMac, Macbook Pro, Beats etc please
ok how about thisDISCLAIMERS:Apple products have extremely limited upgradability.Custom Built PCs have no overall service/support, and require assembly.Custom Built PCs have no.. what should i list here, and what should i leavee out of custom builds? i'll leave out wireless, bluetooth, thunderbolt, and sd card reader. You guys happy to keep keyboard, mouse, webcam, speakers, software?
Custom Built PCs have no overall service/support, and require assembly.how about using Google/common sense?individual parts still have warranties.
https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3739174seems like the CPU throttles because of the high temperature, my current laptop does the same, if the temp gets too high 80ºC in my case it will go down to 800MHz until the temp drops.tl;dr it's not mac specific
warranty is different to service/support
The fag that made the guide forgot the 140$ Windows cost for the mac.If you want an OS worth more than its weight in shit you need either Windows or GANOO.http://www.computerworld.com/article/2912619/mac-os-x/apples-os-x-rootpipe-patch-flops-fails-to-fix-flaw.html
tl;dr it's not mac specificThen the issue becomes how often the CPU gets hot enough to require throttling.
why the fuck would i buy windows? why the fuck i would pay 240$ for 21'' monitor, why the fuck i would need to pay 200$ for mobo, why the fuck i need wireles ac, also wtf is keyboard and mouse 50$ each? you can get decent shit for for 30$ each easely. For 1100$ i coul easely build gaming pc that would rip this Imac a new asshole.I know i fallen to this bait.
No, actually the only overpriced Apple products are the Mac Pro and debatably the Mac Mini
what kind of service/support do you think you need that you can't provide yourself if you're building a computer?
slim laptops weren't made to do heavy tasks.in his case i doubt any mac or mac-like laptop will do any better
I know i fallen to this baitI always had the sneaking suspicion that /g/ had a ton of obnoxious Indian tech support guys, but now I know for sure.
needing more support than an Internet connection and a search engine
Apple products do have some limited serviceability and upgradabilityDon't they go to the extent of soldering the battery on the board now?Custom builds have no service/supportWell, where the law allows it macs have no free support beyond legally mandated warranties. Here it's all paid.
Without paying for applecare, you get 1 year hardware warranty and 90 days technical supportMost PC components have a 2-3 year warranty by default.
http://pcpartpicker.com/p/HVHnhMthis is about the same price as the top end iMac, but this can actually drive the display :^
On some models, yet. However, some models do allow some limited user service options. You can upgrade the RAM on the iMac, for example.And it is POSSIBLE to repair any Apple computer. It's just really, REALLY fucking difficult.
yetMeant "yes". Some models have soldered batteries.
You guys happy with this?
1.4ghzdear god why? couldn't they just get some shitty 35 watt part and at least have it run at 2ghz stock?
almost 12 months old. will likely be updated at WWDC in 10 days
It wasn't acceptable performance from a thousand dollar desktop 12 months either.
why would you give the custom built pc a shitty low voltage cpu? you can easily get an i5 4690k for that price
Silly anon, you're obviously not thinking like a shill.
Wake up people. This guy is obviously employed by apple and spouting complete shit to sell their products. FUCK OFF SHILL
useless charts literally no on cares about
non k is 225. K is more. shall i do the non k?
Fuck no. Ditch the low-voltage CPU. Put in a discrete GPU. Give more reasonable price for mouse and keyboard, especially since most people already own them.Ditch Windows. People might choose a different OS or pirate Windows. Even if they get it legitimately, most people already own at least one Windows license and would just migrate that license to their new computer rather than buying a new license.Obviously. It's just not working.
decent keyboards and mice are easily $50. The apple ones that the iMac has are like $80 each. What would be a discreet graphics that performed equal to the intel iris pro?
It may cost $80 to buy separately but it's also shit.
how much is one of those Microsoft touch mice?
Touch mice are gimmicky garbage.
i don't give a fuck about the imacs and similar pcs but i definetelly appreciate the macbook and mac pro ones
The apple ones that the iMac has are like $80 each.And they're both gimmicky crap. The keyboard is wireless and has extremely short key travel. The mouse has only one physical button, meaning that EVERY interaction other than simple clicking requires touch control.A good keyboard and mouse will run you around $20 each.A good mouse $25:http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-910-001822-M510-Wireless-Mouse/dp/B003NR57BY/ref=sr_1_5?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1432925001&sr=1-5&keywords=mouseA good keyboard $16:http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-920-002478-Keyboard-K120/dp/B003ELVLKU/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1432925252&sr=1-2&keywords=keyboardThere you go. A mouse and keyboard, both better than Apple's crap and for under $50 total.
Who the fuck wants a touch mouse?By the way, they don't cost $50. Search Amazon for "touch mouse". Even if you require a shitty gimmicky mouse, you can still get them for much less than $50. There are some that expensive, but others for as low as $25.
Midrangei5 + GT 750600$ 1440p monitor1TB HDD costs 25$ more than 500GB//5k PC270X5k270X5k270X5kNice try
Fucking retard. Nobody pays for Windows Windows 10 will be gratis anyways and why would I want it instead of glorious gnu/linux? -$140. $75 for wireless AC? -$45, or $75 cause wifi is useless. Congrats, you now have a better CPU, RAM, and HDD for $200 less, not to mention savings you could get by using cheaper monitors, mice, keyboards, mobos, etc. Also the Dell that is $200 less is still better. If you add a GPU to the custom it beats the next two iMacs. Btw, remember that all those GPUs are mobile, so you could save a bunch for equal performance. 5k is not as overpriced, although the Dell 5k monitor definitely is.Not as overpriced as they previously were, but still more expensive than better alternatives.windows for workstationWatAnd I really hope you realize how much this process you wrong, that performance difference between the Mac and other cheaper computers is insane.
5k27inpick one

gaymingstop right there m8
I don't see a problem here
I use a wired mouse, but most people like wireless.
tl;dr for this thread: macs give you better value for a ton of things you'll never actually use. if you shop for your actual needs, pcs are better.
OK are you all happy with this?
You don't know that 270X doesn't support 5k resolution, right..?
$2500 for 5K displayWe've already said that's wrong. You can get 5K displays for about half that price, and even the model you listed is available for $600 cheaper.One you listed $1900:http://pcpartpicker.com/part/dell-monitor-up2715kOther display $1299:http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VO85RY6/?tag=pcpapi-20$140 for WindowsNot everyone will use WIndows. Those who do will probably migrate a license. Others may pirate.
http://pcpartpicker.com/part/dell-monitor-up2715kok thanks. yeah i'm just working out monitors still and prices. i understand that the iMacs and dell ultrasharps are usually the same panels? newegg dell monitor prices and models are all over the place so i might source monitor prices from amazon
does the 280 support 5k?
Look it up yourself. I'm not going to help an Apple shill.
you have already helped me. thanks.
not building your own computerbuying a laptopbuying a mac
Do not answer for me, please.But my answer would be almost the same
OK last update for the day. All monitor prices now from newegg too. 280x added to 5k pc and psu price upped to $75 as it says it needs 750watt psu

That's the funny partWell.. it's stupid to run 5k at single card anyway. Except the Titan X
Brendan Eichman stepped down quite quickly after his transgressions were brought to light. Why has this fuckhead not been srutinized as well? Especially since HIS transgressions relate directly to Mozilla.https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2015/03/10/mozillas-mission-in-the-context-of-digital-advertising/I focus on creating content and advertising experiences for our users that also drive revenue for the project. I came to Mozilla after spending time on Madison Avenue, in Venture Capital, and as founder of tech startups. I love skiing, tennis, cooking, entrepreneurship, and my family.
Because nobody with an agenda is trying to fabricate an outrage. Good luck, OP.
The first time, eith Eichman, it may have been an agenda, as you call it. This man however has a background in ads, and wants to turn Firefox into an ad-riddled sewer drain.
If that happens, it will be forked again, as if there aren't enough forks already.Look at ABP, it got a fork over a fucking option to disable blocking unobstrusive ads.
And just like ABE, those forks will be maintained by 2,5 autists and used by 100 autists. The problem with modern browsers is how big and complex they've become, it's no longer feasible to maintain a project by a small team of enthusiasts, while a dedicated team of professionals requires a lot of money.tl;dr forks that really make a difference and not just strip out a few features that you can disable already aren't likely to happen.
feminist fag and mozillafag here.we had a plan to get this maggot out of mozilla for years. we hate the guy for his prop8 support.frankly i don't care if your steve jobs, you deserve to have you career ruined for supporting prop 8 - because it's tantamount to ruining the careers of LGBT before *they even start*.I hope firefox's monitoring can help weed about any homophobic people so we can out them.That will give more jobs for the women in technology - finally, we'll have real equalism.I hope you enjoyed this, it was all bait.

I never implied that. They're both shit, to be honest. uBlock is the good one and last time I checked it had 100k FF users. Besides, this isn't even the point, these extensions are offered on the official AMO page, which boosts their popularity greatly, this is not the case with obscure browser forks that are only mentioned on 4chan.

I found it really insensitive for him to have a plethora of mental issues and the name "Elliott." It really resonates with me after the Isla Vista killings and any clear references to Elliott Rodger such as this one shouldn't be tolerated. His name should never be uttered or referenced anywhere again because depressed people like them will see this and think, "If I shoot somebody, I will become famous and people will talk about me on TV and then later they will make a show about me."Well, fuck that.

GNOME because i want to get things done

I started with KDE, tried to live with it for a few months, realized it's absolute shit, switched to GNOME.The malfunctioning themes, man. KDE sucks.
WM + your favorite programs.Alternatively, plasma 5.
wants to get things donepicks the de with the worst workflow
Gnome, Because its the only DE out there that's innovating and trying to do things differently.
G N O M ENOME
different=good
pantheon or dwm
I guess it's because OP asked about DE's specifically and a lot of people don't run a fully fledged DE.And in the DE world gnome is the most reasonable choice if you want it or not since it's the most mature and polished one.It does require some time to get used to but my workflow doesn't suffer from it and i like the fact that gnome's devs put some research into human ergonomy and how ergonomic user interface should look like.
AgreedThe activities 'hot-corner' is the tits
use super key lad
Like removing the menu-bars in all programs. How do you even access the new "cog" menu with a keyboard? Alt + keys doesn't work.
Windows DE, all the others lack.
Pantheon
Gnome because muh lightweight DEs feels like broken Win 2000 imitation with pointless customization and inane defaults and KDE reminds me of Stardock software on top of Vista. Super + F10?https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/keyboard-nav.html.enhttps://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/shell-keyboard-shortcuts.html.en
Yes anon because menu bars under the title are beautiful to look at.You can access the menu bar with ctrl + alt + tab.Does nobody bother to even look at gnomes keybinds ?
MATEGnome 3 can go suck a dick.
LXQt or LXDEor just IceWM-Lite or OpenBox
I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Pantheon, is in fact, GNOME/Plank, or as I've recently taken to calling it, outdated GNOME broken by amateur designers plus dock.

If you aren't retarded, i3wm is the only right choice.
I too love it when a pop-up dialog takes up half my screen
I like Gnome. Mostly because I don't do any serious work on Linux and I treat it more as a upscale alternative to Windows.Though I think Xfce is probably better in general, and if I used it daily that would be my DE of choice.
At least install https://github.com/chpii/Headerbar and lower your font Scaling Factor.
https://github.com/chpii/Headerbarmite be usefullower your font Scaling Factor.But it only makes the top status bar smaller, so it's not helping a lot.
GNOME because I'm not a furry and my toaster is capable enough.
menu bars under the title are beautiful to look at.They aren't ugly. They're hidden by default. They provide fast keyboard shortcuts.But I guess it's not "innovative" enough for GNOME and wouldn't work on something with touch-input not saying GNOME is made for touch-input devices, but it heavily looks like it was.
Is that comment licensed under a free license? Because I want to reuse it.
Unity
0.8 makes all text 20% smaller and all gtk3 UI elements scales to fit it
I don't think they did it that way because of a touch interface  if you look at my screenshot  A bunch of gtk apps are starting to use header bars now, You can't really put a menu bar on top or underneath a header bar or it would look silly. I think its fine where they put the menu but obviously our opinions on things differ.
I've tried 0,8 font rendering goes to shit it's all squiggly i guess my screen resolution is too small
How resource intensive gnome now?Compare to let say cinnamon, Xfce, and Lxde?
minimize buttonFor what purpose?
It's still pretty high up I think. A tiny amount less than KDE and Unity basically.
kek
i use gnomei love how 3d acceleration fucks up almost every program that uses GPU in some way. Games stutters every few seconds, mplayer on vdpau freezes if i'll focus on another window. Sometimes i'm just running another x session just to watch a movieon the other hand, i'm still using it - i like those hot corners, i like how it looks, i like its easy mouse-based navigationgod, someday i'll just go full fedora and keep using i3 only
gpu wise its less than cinnamon probably a tad bit more than xfce & lxde. Cpu wise hardly anything really screenshot is of the system monitor with the shell highlighted.No real purpose mostly just for looks i think it looks better with it.
Xfce plus some minor GPU load for widget drawinggnome-shell process is ~100 Mb
Compare to let say cinnamon, Xfce, and Lxde?A lot higher than XFCE and lxde.running gnome3 + firefox + few apps and it's at 1,4GB of ram
Even more than cinnamon?For some reason cinnamon's window compositor run like shit on my machineHow is gnome's?
those huge title barsWhy? Can you remove them or make them smaller?
LXDEBecause "muh resources"
Using outdated toolkitsNah.
mate
Nvidia gpu?
a tad bit more than lxdeYou realize LXDE uses like less than 100 MB of RAM?
And it looks like it
yep
are you using the x11 software renderer or the opengl gpu renderer? It is x11 by default even with the nvidia driver installed
title barsThere is only one title bar on his screenshot.
being this autisticI don't care what you call it, but why are the top bars one the file manager and terminal so fucking huge?
I was talking about gpu usage not ram usage. I posted a screenshot to help him judge by himself.
not a DE
in Gnome?damn, i didn't even knew that there are any choice in gnome renderers.

It bothers me more that I have to use xprop to get the window class, then edit the i3 config file and reset i3 in order to have something do what it should do in the first place.
KDE in high-specced PCs; Xfce for the rest.
lightdm, i3, conky, i3bar, rofi, comptonYeah i wish
Titlebars take up vertical space.Moving every application's titlebar to a single one doesn't save space.No one stacks windows vertically with floating window managers. Most people keep windows maximized anyway. The only thing it accomplishes is you having to move your mouse further to select the titlebar/menubar which is always on the very top of your screen. If they wanted to conserve vertical space with wide-screen monitors, they'd get rid of the horizontal taskbar and move it to the side vertical bar.That "tiny" bit of hypocrisy is why I can't take GNOME seriously.
Since 3.10, many applications have switched to use header bars rather than the traditional combination of titlebar, toolbar and menu bar. This has the advantage of reducing the amount of screen space used by window chrome, keeps the window close button available, and allows dynamic controls that change according to the view in the window. https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/GnomeGoals/HeaderBars
tilling...  you get the bad with the good, considering how easy it is all and how it seamlessly works...
No! It saves space, totally!The space they saved with global titlebars is lost on those huge ass header bars and buttons.
Well can you remove them or make them smaller? I don't want huge buttons and titles.
why does a tiling wm tile by default
It varies theme by theme, I don't get why people are bitching they aren't that big, Pic semi related here is an old screenshot of ubuntu's nautilus i think it's bigger now.
Which one takes more space?
or this
I don't use any titlebars, and toolbars are useless on most applications. So I just hide them and have a small menubar for most things. Putting everything together looks gross to me and makes everything too big.
The menubar with file, edit, etc only shows when you hold down alt. The total size of the titlebar + with the button toolbar is the same as GNOME's headerbars.
Second one takes up a bit more space while providing a lot more functionality.Headerbars are fucking retarded.
a lot more functionalityFor example?
The idea of header bars is to not look like a cluttered fucking mess, The functionality is all still there scroll up there are plenty of screenshots.

Does it only work with GNOME?
Arc is a flat theme with transparent elements for GTK 3, GTK 2 and Gnome-Shell. It supports GTK 3 and GTK 2 based desktop environments like Gnome, Unity, Budgie, Pantheon, etc.No download it and try it.

Actually using the clusterfuck that is gnome 3
lxde
How is it a clusterfuck?Yeah, it is a fully featured DE, but I would say kde is way more of a clusterfuck than gnome.However, the gnome development process is indeed a clusterfuck
Gnome 2 was godly. KDE is a KDisaster, and Gnome 3 needs way more work. The only reason XFCE is still considered as good as it is is because they can't afford a complete rehash.I guess I'm really partial to modular DEs, one where you can swap out a part like it's nothing.
The only problem I have with gnome 3 is that you cant rightclick the 'launchpad' or whatever its called and make a folder. you instead need to edit a config file.Do gnome devs not see this as an obvious problem?Also, you still cant change your refresh rate through gnome.I fucking hate gnome devs
I gave GNOME a good 3 months to win me over. I tried customising it, learning the shortcuts and everything. Yet there always seemed to be one problem after another. The new UI it provides is just unnecessary and only cripples power users. It's a tablet UI.Went back to Xfce without even realising it.
There's no problem with the metro menu?Windows switches from a little app menu to a fullscreen retard button menu, and everyone loses it. Gnome follows in their footprints, and people just say 'Eh'.
The only problem I have with gnome 3 is that it is only partially usable in distros other than Fedora.
Works great on gentoo
I hate how GNOME3 turns off the screen instantly when you lock it. If you check the issue tickets on it, the devs are so far up their ass they actually think it's a feature and should be left as-is with no option to even have a screen timeout because it's somehow "saving the environment".
The best part is when you cant get your hand off the mouse fast enough, so the screen turns back on.Thanks gnome devs
it doesn't work like the other decan't configure it to work like other deit must be tablet oriented and not suited for mature users such as myself
Does it have gnome software or you're editing config files to get folders in Super-A menu?
I have to cripple myself because GNOME devs told me to
gnome software is not a thing on gentooNo idea why, but it should be integrated into the super + a menu to begin with
Stumpwm with the occasional Xfce panel I mostly use it without a panel or a modeline.
I'm a sperglordIf you don't like what I like you're crippled LOLunjustified GNOME dev hatetypical /g/ user
Is there a global menu bar extension for Gnome 3 yet?
*tips fedora*
Gnome user here.It's my belief that the hate for gnome devs is completely justified
unjustified GNOME dev hate
Cinnamon. XFCE is good, but lacks polish. i3 is not bad if you just want a WM.
No idea why, but it should be integrated into the super + a menu to begin withThe majority of users don't even need it and if they do I'm sure they'll be able to find "Add to folder" button in software manager. No need for useless clutter.
Why would you want non instant lock?
So a simple"Make Folder"right-click dialogue is clutter?You think opening an applicationthat most distros don't have, mind you, scrolling down a list and click add to folder isn't an issue?By chance, are you a gnome dev?
If you don't agree with the design philosophy, don't use it, just don't be hatin'.People like you are the reason why there's starving children in Africa.

some people dont have the time to spend a few hours daily to fix a shit tier OS. there's a reason why its only used by NEETs
Make sure you are on the Internet.i.e. make sure you have run the service dhcpcdsystemctl start dhcpcdAnd if you have chrooted into your Antergos, make sure you copy /etc/resolv.conf from the installer if that one is already working to /mnt/etc/resolv.conf or wherever you've mounted it to.
You don't have a connection. Are you using WiFi or Ethernet?
antergosThat's what happens when using this shit instead of using the Arch.
k
There is absolutely no reason to touch /etc/resolv.conf manually if using DHCP.prior to the install processBecause that was not the same system. There is the live system, and there is now the system you have installed. Configure your network.
Ethernet masterracesystemctlUnknown command
There is absolutely no reason to touch /etc/resolv.conf manually if using DHCP.I meant if running dhcpcd from the installation media before chrooting in.
Run systemctl as root.
systemctlUnknown commandI already knew that Arch derivations were broken, but this takes it to a new level.Yeah, but you run dhcpcd *before* chrooting. Everything else is braindead. You need internet to pacstrap. And there is no system to chroot into if you haven't pacstrapped it.
Worked thank you based anon
Sorry, meant to addressOn the other hand, you don't need to be root to run systemctl. Something is broken somewhere.
antergosinstall gentoo
If systemctl is in /usr/sbin or /sbin, those may not be in the PATH of users who aren't root.That's why you can't normally just run "ifconfig" in Debian without being root unless you write out the full path.Arch does weird stuff with its bin directories.
Anyone else think it was ascii art of a city skyline from the thumbnail?

He never read those, even when he was still an admin.And then he went on /q/ to complain that no one ever sends him any mails.
I usually wouldn't care but these freezes are extremely suspicious. Before j00t did it only for serious changes to the way 4chan works. And at least he had the decency to post somewhere what the fug is going on.I don't see how that's connected but in any case I've been here since way before you.
one day 4chan will go down and never wake up

I don't see how that's connected but in any case I've been here since way before you.the site has frozen many times with no announcements proceeding it. i'm implying you're new due to the fact you are already looking through rose colored glasses, thinking the site was any different the past few years even when j00t was in charge.
I'd say we request some transparency.As a user of a free service you have nothing to request. Only thing you can do is to offer a helping hand if you've got some server admin skills.

shitpost on reddit or another *chan
Hilarious
Probably
Naahhh, community always has power.We ARE 4chan, essentially.Plus donation and ad revenue
Nice blog
Naahhh, community always has power.Examples of this sentence applying to 4chan?
/v/ and /b/ made Anita Sarkeesian a successful and rich feminist SJW.
Via :Looking at the behavior, there was likely a patch in the server software, between Linux and nginx, to to fix a problematic memory leak. All of 4chan was offline for a moment for a reboot, so it likely wasn't a Yotsuba Image Board backend upgrade, as it can be hot-patched with minimal downtime, and the storage array which hosted board data for the low-traffic SFW boards - /g/, /o/, /i/ and /ic/, /f/, /po/ among others, seemed to be offline for a solid moment.It was either that, or another power or system failure otherwise caused the servers to fault offline.Chances are, the reboot busted a couple high-cycle-time drives' SMART numbers, and while the server was online, the data on those arrays hosting those boards were inaccessible while RAID went through and rebuilt things.
Dumbfuck I'm talking about community having any effect on 4chan's administration
moot left because the fappening etc
patch in the server softwareSurely you mean implementing an API for the NSA to use freely and help them profile this place completely.
This is what you get when trusting apelGood riddance
I've been here since way before you.Yeah? Well I've been here *all summer*
spot the newfag
implying they don't already have one
implying someone wont instantly put up a replacement
Side effect.
Implying I haven't already arranged with them to start hosting it as soon as the paperwork goes through.
I want a name, a name that I can post in all caps whenever something about 4chan isn't right.
This.

Keep yelling about moot if it makes you feel better. This is still all his fault.

Hey /g/, I am having troubles creating a gmail account that  is professional and Isn't yet taken that relates to my name, any suggestions as to how to keep it professional but still keep it mine? Here's a list of ones i have tried. Jordan.couturier@gmail.comJordan.apps@gmail.comJordan.mitchell@gmail.comJordan.cou@gmail.comJordan.cout@gmail.comI don't want it to be too complicated and Im not really sure where having numbers in your e-mails stand within the professional world. im assuming not good.

Register a domain and send the MX records to Gmail.Have the domain be either your name or something simple.
See if Jcouturier@gmail.com is taken
Just took all of those.  That's what you get for trusting a complete stranger.
they were already taken..

I've been trying to figure out when Google is releasing new phones.
I got tired of the shitty package managers for OS X like Homebrew and MacPorts and decided to just install the programs I need from source without relaying on third parties. Now I want to write a superior package manager in C++. Main goal: fast as fuck and maybe inspired by portage.
I went to work.
I fapped few times and then took a shower. You?

what happened next faggot
wrote a fap roulette program in python that grabs a random video from pornhub and plays it in mpc-hc with an option of saving it for later. I wish pornhub had an api so I could sort by category
It failed : I left the computer and when I came back I found an error compiling the GNU coreutils because the OS X included texinfo is obsolete. I had to manually download the latest Texinfo, compile it and link the "makeinfo" binary to the Gentoo prefix. It worked, but when compiling pkg-config it failed again because some error on some obscure OS X header, probably because some incompatibility with clang/gcc extensions. So I decided it's not worth the effort.Now I want to install the real Gentoo.

Join officially instead of begging. Almost nobody gets invited to trackers via /ptg/. We're mostly about private tracker bros helping each other out with requests, sharing information from other trackers, adding bounty, etc
Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 2 Scene release when? I don't want to actually pay for a video game but I think I'm going to do it if there isn't a scene release soon.
Are Scene trackers the best for software?
tfw Empornium is still not reopening to public sign-upstfw too autistic to just talk to them on IRC about my disabled accountFuck my life. It's killing me because I know they got way more stuff than Pornbay.
taking requests for stuff
There is an invite stat on everybody's profile page and they just made up a new user class with zero perks, which makes me think invites are near.
thisI went from good perv to great perv without doing anything. I'm considering ranking up to sextreme perv just in case invites will be available at that level later on.
I've heard that private trackers don't have much content compared to The Pirate Bay and are usually governed by immature people.Good on those people who provide a good service, even if it is quite elitist, but most of them are probably trash.
they just made the great perv level, thats why you got moved up
Any of you niggas got any contact into or anything? Maybe you guys can invite me or something. I'd post my ratios on pornbay and what.cd so you know I wouldn't fuck y'all over. I really don't want to talk to them on IRC though. I tried like twice and I just ended up pussying out and closing the page.
I'm sorry you somehow felt the need to tell me this when I obviously already knew it anon. I mean it's not as if it's not just in the post directly above mine after all
I've heard that private trackers don't have much content compared to The Pirate Bay and are usually governed by immature people.you are incorrect in a wayprivate trackers lack some areas of content because they specialize. General private trackers tend to be a mess, so specialization makes it easier to moderate as well as make it easier to bring more content. If you join enough trackers that fit your needs, you've definitely got more than just 1 general tracker would ever have, such as TPB.
Are you this guy? 
Some private trackers are great, like Teh/PTP with their large, high quality, generally well seeded libraries. Others like AHD are also very good for their well seeded archive of high quality encodes. However, you could probably find 99% of your content on a single tracker Rutracker.
staff pretend to be normal users asking for invites and when you invite them, they ban you for inviting strangersHe takes his job very seriouslyHe does it For free
Yes....unfortunately.
Are you serious?Empornium doesn't even fucking have invites, you ALREADY HAVE AN ACCOUNT, and you're just too autismal to get it re-enabled?And you want someone to invite you anyway?
mfw I have an account on all god tier trackers wcd,ptp,tbn,ahd,hdb.. to name a few while being the poorest fag on /g/ with the shittiest connection. less than 1024kb/s dl and 0 upload.come at me bro
tfw 98.54% of a 161,347 strong community have uploaded 4 or less torrentstfw 2355 users are carrying the rest of empornium
I kinda pity you. I can download anything you can, but at literally 17 times faster from my bedroom and 20 times faster from my living room. I'm assuming you meant 1024kb/s as in 1MB/s, right? If not, it's an order of magnitude higher.sux 2 b u
That's pretty shitty that you would risk getting an anon from here banned just because you don't join their IRC and get your disabled account back.What was wrong with it? I can help you with buffer if you get it re-enabled if that was the issue
post an anonymous email, I will invite you
With your non-existant invites?
if i say i posted in wcd thread, and tell somebody from /g/ to invite me to oppatie based on the post. would that get me banned? i'm barely a power user with 300gb upload but only 6 uploads. but i'd rather do go through perfect flac route instead of just doing transcodes.
It will depend on the rules when/if invites are enabled. Besides, if you already have an account I don't think you can make a new one even with an invite without getting banned.
ahdgod tierpick one and only one anonelder god tier is BTN, WCD, HDB and BIB.tfw I'm missing BIB
Well I didn't know they didn't have invites. I could've sworn they said they were adding invites once they fixed their security and shit because they might not be opening back up to the public...or at least that's what I heard.I honestly don't remember. I don't think it was my ratio though. Do they just disabled your account if you stop using it for a while?mfw someone trying to get me permanently bannedWhy would you do that?Well FUCK. So that means I'm going to have to talk to someone from their IRC then? FUCK.
You just need to prove to someone on /g/ that you're on wcd right? You could always just edit your profile and not risk making a post.
Bibgod tieryou have no idea what you're talking about
i'd just say, oh i uploaded this cd, and then you can message me, i respond, and it's just from there. I don't even know what oppaitime offers, I'm just intrigued it's offered in Elite forums instead of power user
You have to log in at least every 4 months IIRC, otherwise it will get disabled.Hello I need this book. Where do I go anon?inb4 libgen
Why would you do that?Maybe because you're blatantly trying to break several rules while also putting the accounts of others at risk solely because you're autistic
Hello I need this bookWhat book?Honestly libgen probably has it if Bib has it.
1 MB/s, poorest fagSeriously nigger? I've been on PTP for 6 years and my net is 600 kBps/30 kBps. I also limit my up speed to 5 kBps. It's all about bonus points.
All this to just get into oppatime???Literally post your email and one of the site admins will invite you without fail. Or go into their IRC and ask.

Any seedbox recommendations?Always wondered how do you control the software remotely?  Is there a web interface? They say stuff like 'supports Deludge' but what does that mean?  You can run Deludge or Transmit or whatever on your computer and have it remotely run the torrent, or there is some kind of front end?
Asked last thread but it archived before I could get a reply.Does anyone have any experience with thegeeks.bz or any of its affiliate trackers? Are they worth joining?
I'm in thegeeksIt's shit but easy to get in.I'd like to join theVault though
web interface, torrent client runs on their servers
Just do it you nigger.My account had been disabled since early 2013, I just got re-enabled about a month ago.
ebooks.wtf actually looks quite cool
Soupwhale actually follows through on their offer the whole free seedbox thing. They just drop you at a unix prompt though; you have to setup the tools rtorrent, rutorrent, transmission-cli yourself, but they have some guides on their wiki, and it actually to my surprise really is a free 1Gb/s seedbox with disk space being the only limiter. I haven't purchased more disk space, but they claim it's a one-time-fee, no monthly shit, of $10 for 30GB.
But...people in the IRC will see.tfw I'll probably just end up sticking to PornBay and missing out on all the shit Empornium hasFUCK. I wish I fucking used my account more.
Why doesn't anybody like fux0r.eu? Best porn tracker imo
I don't mind setting up transmission remote as it's my current client on linux.so you pay 10$ once and you have a seedbox with 1Gb/s and a 30GB disk space forever ?
fux0r.euShit tracker with a shit selection compared to alternatives.Best porn tracker imoYour "o" is wrong
You pay $0 and have 1gbps with 10GB space for as long as you keep using itYou pay $10 and get 30GB added to your account forever
No, it comes with 10Gb for free, so $10 will get you 40Gb.
Kk. My b. I never asked for an invite anywhere else because it always served my needs kink.com siterips updated monthly
Right up there with the holy trinity wcd, btn, ptp am I right? KEK
Thanks.not legit
not legitWell i mean, it took me about an hour to get rutorrent set up, they have a script that just does it for you but I wanted to learn, and then i was seeding my sample torrent at several megs per second. I didn't try a speed test, but it sure *seems* legit. Their IRC is full of happy /g/ people.
Holy Fuck, I'm trying to signupI don't mind spending a day setting up rutorrent or tsm remote.can I have an invite pleaseewbb8@notsharingmy.infoI would appreciate a lot
Uhh I don't have any invites, just go in their irc

What do you guys think about MongoDB? Should I take the time to learn it? Is it promising enough to be needed as a necessary DB for the future?  In other words is it going to be big enough in the future to the point where I'm going to have to learn it anyways.
Terrible. If you have to learn any form of NoSQL, learn Redis and use it with Mysqlor MariaDB or Percona or Postgres if you gotta go slow.
Is it promising enough to be needed as a necessary DB for the future?Just go with oracle.

If you don't know why you need it then you probably don't need it.  If you don't really need it and it becomes  A THING then there will probably be some abstraction layer so you can get by.
Your mom said my MongoDB was big enough to make your father learn it
OP here. have you had a bad experience with Mongo?
did she really?
Learning Mongo is stupid because Mongo has a very narrow use case, eventually people will stop being bandwagoning retards and realize it's shit for most of the things they're using it for.
Postgress isn't even NoSQL you twat.Op, download community edition of couchbase and fuck around with it if you wan't to play with NoSQL.
if you don't work for a big company that have to handle a lot of data like google, facebook, twitter or NSA, you'll probably never need it. If on the future the companies goes full retard like they did for java, then you'll probably need to learn it.
I have an offer of three dell poweredge 1950 servers, two poweredge 2950, and two unknown dell servers.The PE1950s are 4GB with dual coresThe PE 2950 are 4Gb with quad coresthe unknowns.. not sure with 32GB ramWants 500 for everything...I work in IT in a very impoverished school district.

http://pcpartpicker.com/p/pbz7FTIf each one of you gave me $1 I could buy this and be happy, don't you want me to be happy?
absolutely don't. in fact, i'd rather you be miserable in life
But then I won't have a good pc, why would you want that?
No.
start a kickstarter X[
i like artificial barriers of entry to tech fields so my pay can stay disproportionately high
Trust me, a processor won't make you happy.I know this because I have a 4770k and it doesn't bring me happiness. Should I sue Intel for not bringing me happiness? Think I should.
Why not?Start it for me plz.I'm not entering tech, I'm entering vidya.
You are insane. The combination of my processor+ssd brings me happiness every time I turn it on.
It might make me able to play demanding games with my internet buddies and that might fill the hole in my heart.
And what is that CUMbination.get it? cum hahahaha
Not even a 980 brought me happiness :maybe I'm just dead inside!
Kill self plz.
Bump plz respond.
rude, good sir, rood.I actually bought a 970 but I mistyped. Maybe if I'd gotten my full 4gb of RAMS then I would be happy. :
Look at it this way: If video games make you happy already, you'll be even happier with more powerful hardware. An engrossing game world is all the more engrossing the more beautiful it looks and the less stuttering there is.But if you're buying the powerful hardware in the hope that running games on it will bring you happiness-- that's never going to work. Running at 4K60 doesn't magically make a game good.
970 is a great card, anon, and 0.5GB is not going to make a difference in any practical scenario.
OP don't get sucked into more vidya, do something useful like not play vidya.
0.5GB is not going to make a difference in any practical scenario.But it is making him unhappy.
something usefulOk I'll bite, like what?
if you're not wealthy enough to afford it, you shouldn't have it. this is entire problem of poor people, they live in shit conditions and instead of doing something with this they're buying a fucking i5 computer to temporary feel better
I could afford it if I get a job, but I'm too lazy.
I'm mostly kidding, but I'm sure you guys understand what it's like to upgrade your computer and how you get sucked into that, building the ultimate gaming rig for your budget. It's almost more fun than actually playing vidya sometimes.It's not really, but still kind of a shitty situation. But hey, if I get some money out of that class action lawsuit, then the 970 will have been a screaming good deal.
begging on the internet
It isn't humiliating because I'm anonymous.
which part do you want the most?
for your budgetI don't even have a budgetThe motherboard.
ok. well i was just wondering, i'm not actually gonna get it for you.
Why not?
cuz i'm poor :
It's okay, take a loan and spend it on me.
Not that anon but your begging is cringeworthy. I'm also poor and I can guarantee you that this shit won't work.Stream something on Twitch. Find some gimmick and make all your reactions extreme. Encourage viewers to donate by setting it up so that the message from each donation is read out by text-to-speech.You'll get plenty of donations just so they can hear filthy hilarious stuff read out on stream.Or! Grab Unity, make a shitty video game. It should be physics based and vaguely addictive. Sell it, or put it up on the Play Store for free with in-app purchases and ads.Work for it, is the point.
Or just fucking work at walmart for 2 weeks and you'll have $1000 and a new computer.
Not that anon but your begging is cringeworthy.You're just saying that because you're cheap, also I don't want to put effort into making money, why can't people just recognize how good of a person I am and give me money for it.

I know, I know, it seems like there's a thread every day, we're all shilling, etc. But bear with me for a moment.I think I've found a sleeper-hit of a feature with this phone: The audio is surprisingly good.I got mine yesterday, and I just plugged in my Superlux HD681 EVOs and poked around at the built in music player + EQ settings and I've gotta say: Goddamn this sounds nice. It gets surprisingly loud for a phone, sounds really clear, and has enough oomph to really get the bass punching. Anyone know what audio chip is in this phone? Can someone confirm that it's as good as it seems?This might secretly be the phone to get for using it as a music player.
Users: Fucking nothing works with Crossfire!!!AMD: Just disable itSo I bought 2 GPUs for what?
AMD HAS NO DRIVERS
i'll buy your gpus anon
Post your email and I'll send you these pieces of shit for 200€. You can have 2 290x for that much.

You're an idiot if you buy two GPUs to crossfire/SLI.
I wouldn't use Xfire or SLI anyway, AMD is doing the right thing, they should cut off all development for Xfire for games and general pixel pushing, and only focus on HPC uses until there's a way to remove microstutter on API/Driver levels. Don't be retarded, buy a single powerful GPU.
Implying SLI is any betterMulti GPU technology for gaming as a whole is complete trash.
fThis. The four games that it works properly for aren't worth the headache or cash. Inb4 nvidia shills who get their advice from their friend who "knows computers" start claiming sli has ever been better.
So I bought 2 GPUs for what?kek sli or cf have been gimmicky shit since gf 7000 & ati 19xx lineup. FPS is not 200%gain but only few boost so yeah worthless.
protip: SLI is just as bad. Microstutter is even worse with nvidya
Every single informed human buys one strong gpu. No one to blame but yourself anon. Its a marketing tactic on both ends to get you to buy two gpus, often older models they want to clear stock of anyways
I keep telling people that SLI/Crossfire are trash but they keep shilling for that AMD card with 2 GPUs on a single board.
Doesn't Nvidia's drivers support AMD cards? I can see why they wouldn't but also why wouldn't it?
Doesn't Nvidia's drivers support AMD cardsu wot m8
Doesn't Nvidia's drivers support AMD cards?Wait what? I don't think so.
trollling ona reeevvuuurrrr
You're fucking pathetic. I can't believe people here are forming some kind of brand loyalty and taking it up the ass, just because it's "their" company fucking them over.
wait, what the fuck is going on?
y tho
Dam, I feel like I must be one of the few that has never had a problem with sli. Still sitting with gtx 770s and the only issues I have are with unoptimized games like mkx and dying lightunless they fixed it already. While over clocked, these things were hitting 95C and were noisy as fuck. That's one legit reason to avoid sli/cf. Ended up wayercooling them instead since summers a bitch. Idling at 27 and loads at 40-50 now
Retard dx12 this year and freesync just w8
[citation needed]
DirectX 12's multi adapter will help when it's out, don't sell your GPUs just yet
Everything will switch its API from DirectX 9 or 11 to 12That's not how it works, unfortunately.
The newer games that'll release, I meant. OP has 2 R9 290Xs, it'll be a waste to sell them IMO
op, YOU SELLING THAT 290X?caps because i'm so excited
Yeah, but it doesn't help any for current titles which is fairly disappointing to say the least. But you're right, they're fine for future games that will actually take advantage of DX12.
AMD driver developers and AMD's vice president read these forums:https://community.amd.com/community/support-forumsGo there and complain a lot so their boss gives them a kick in the butt and makes them work properly.
So I bought 2 GPUs for what?So you can do compute work at 2x the speed.makes a gigantic difference at password cracking.
what is a driver
I had a 6990, I was ready to literally run everything maxed out at 120 fps on my 120hz monitor.Instead, I got constant headaches, buyers remorse. Occasionally of course, I was very impressed, because in benchmarks and some older AAA games the CF worked well but seriously, I've never hated a card so much. Actually replaced it with a 6970 shortly after. Much more consistent performance.I dont know if SLI is better, but from what I've heard, it has better support at the very least.
SLi works better than Crossfire. Always have, always will. AMD software support is just not as good as Nvidia.The 295X2 is a fantastic piece of hardware and you can find it relatively cheap nowadays, but I'll never buy one, simply because of how hit and miss Crossfire is.
Xfire works better than SLI, mostly due to XDMA when it actually works.Usually Nvidia has more widespread support but Xfire works better when there's support to be found.To make a car analogy, Nvidia is a reliable  4WD WRX while AMD is a fast but not always usable Lotus Elise.
How games handles DX12 is up to game devs, they can enable old way similar to Sli/xfire.I don't know why they would do that, but the option is there.
I remembered I had the 9800GTX+ in SLI and that shit was the fucking bomb on my 780i motherboard. God damn, you just don't get these gems anymore.
thissingle-gpu-sli/cf master race

There are still sites that use thisThey won't change anytime soon since they're fucking stupidYou'll always need flash somewhere for compatibilitySon of a fuck.
I work for a web-portal based EMR. Luckily we use php/js/smarty in an MVC. Im surprised that youre allowed to use flash considering how insecure it is, the vpn security is so tight for government facilities. Have you had any security issues?
RIP flash games of my youth. ;_;
thank you google our greatest ally
still can't play my pre 2010 weeb sites made in flash
I don't give a fuck for flashBut this is the prime example of what happens when you give power to a corporation to exercise their shitGoogle chrome is going to turn into the next ie6
at least ie6 wasn't the botnet chrome is
We can all agree Flash is shit though. We want people to actually drop support for it instead of just saying "Flash is dead".
If Google did it back in 2010 when a certain someone was pushing for it this would all be a bad memory by now. Google is not your friend.
But this is the prime example of what happens when you give power to a corporation to exercise their shitWhat ? It's a product they're developing.If they see fit to drop support for useless shit then that's what they should do.If you don't like you, switch browser. It's not like you fucking paid for that thing.
Good ridden, all we need is HTML5.Flash, Silverlight, Java, WebGL can GTFO.
It's a product they're developing.that installs itself like malware

NiconicoYou can use an HTML5 player
I thought they had html5 streaming, at least in beta.Really? Where do you enable it then? Is it for livestreams as well?
HLS. Also, how do you think people on mobile devices watch Twitch streams?
I just changed the user agent
I'm conflicted.I really want flash to die, but I still think /f/ is the best board 4chan has ever had./f/ pls survive.
Makes sense that they only made it available to mobile devices or some shit.

Bullshit. Whenever I switch to the HTML5 player in that browser the video is shit.

Run out of the box with no compability issues and consume much less resources, which is why all 50-60 fps players are HTML5.also
All of the bowsers are shit. Pale moon is shit but the rest are worse.

It works pretty well with basic flash loops and games complex stuff will have rendering problems but it might be able to play it somewhat.
What are ya gona do faggot? Recommend Chrome?

lol im on firefox 28 and effectively browse with flash turned off
There is DRM though.
Well that explains the shilling.
Only if you browse terrible sites and have a DRM plugin installed.
It's about time someone stepped up.You mean Apple?It's about time Google followed suit.
Is there any real source for this?  For all we know, these error messages could be popping up only for people who have for some reason installed the NPAPI plugin in Chrome.
Google started vocally supporting it in the first place. Then they told everyone else to use it.
Google just now, Anno 2015, drops FlashGoogle did it firstApple drops flash 5 years agoGoogle did it first.Whatever you say Google...
Google started vocally supporting it in the first placeYeah, that's why they bundled Flash with Chrome since its inception
Pretty much this.  Apple said accurately, "Flash is a shitty experience".  Google said, "Nah bro, flash is great, see how well it runs on our tablets?"  Flash continued to get shittier, and google finally gave in and decided that they weren't going to bother supporting it either, even though originally they were attempting to use flash as a cudgel against Apple.
Sure iFags. Alrighty then.
Don't even own an apple device, I'm just abreast of the tech world, which you apparently are not.

I just got 2x2412m because I only had a $500 budget from work.  I would have liked the thinner bezels, but otherwise the 2412 is still a great monitor.

Just bought a P2715Q last week, forgetting that my GPU doesn't have Displayport. I'm running it at 30hz until the 980ti comes out, and it looks amazing.
the fuck, it's ips not oled retard
The fuck? I thought all modern GPUs had at least one displayport.
only if you're consent to likely return the monitor for 5 times for repair
I've found 50'' 4k screens with 3D for about 500 bucks. Is that a steal or not?
Depends on where you buy it from.
Fucking everybody falls for the "LED" thing. It's an LCD panel like all the rest, just with a shitty, energy-saving LED backlight instead of a superior CCFL one.
It's a cheap Zotac 750ti. I guess they left out the DP connector to save a couple dollars in manufacturing.

Good CRTs are hard to find, and anybody willing to deal with the downsides in order to have a superior monitor doesn't need to be told.
If you're willing to sacrifice everything else for better black levels, you might as well use a plasma TV as a monitor.

If you can't tell the difference between 5ms and 1ms you need your eyes checked.
In what situation besides Counterstrike is 1ms a benefit?

It's not OLED, it's a LG AH-IPS panel with Dell branding.
I didn't know my eyes can slow down time
another dude herei can verify this and most ips displasy have in reality, a response time from 8 to 20 ms, depending on the paneltn panel with 1ms response time feel clearly more direct in comparison

I have a crappy Gateway monitor that doesn't do DVI anymore.I was thinking of getting a Yiynova 19U+ monitor for drawing. Is it worth about $550?
Buying a panel with ugly colors isn't a meme. 144hz is pointless for most stuff.

Why not get a 120Hz MVA?
As long as you aren't doing color-sensitive shit you're fine.this has been the case forever. the point is that some of us like looking at things with colors and we can pay for good color reproduction.If you're a poor faggot then get TN and be done with it. Just don't try to mislead people into thinking you made the savvy choice. You're poor. You can't buy anything but poor shit.
We never left
As long as you aren't doing color-sensitive shit you're fine.Or you don't care about viewing angles so terrible you can see a difference from top to bottom no matter where you sit.Or you don't care about contrast and black level.Or all you do is rocketjump in Quake and you'd be just fine playing in 640x480 with the graphics turned down to solid colors with bright green player models.

waiting for a 1440p low response time 144Hz IPS panel that doesn't have a 50% chance of coming with weird defectsfug
144hz is pointless for most stuffI play CS:GO professionally so I can't really do without it. Plus it was only $200.The 144hz is actually way cool for 3D modeling, I'm able to be a lot more precise with stuff.Those 24 extra frames do actually make a difference...Response time on a MVA is also not very good.Find me a sub 1ms IPS panel that can do 144hz and get back to me.When you find one I'll switch, until then I'm happy with my purchase for my use case.Go fuck yourself.

that standWhat the fuck, man? How have I never seen that before?
Got Asus Vx228H for $99 just a day ago,like it so far.
You're looking for TFT monitor with 1920x1200 IPS panel edgelit by WLED? Either buy Eizo EV2436, HP z24i or LG 24MB65PY.LG has the worst input lag from these three, but its cheapest in Europe. All have pretty similar contrast and color reproduction but obviosly no blacks. LG and HP use DC modulation for dimming the LED backlight on whole config range, but Eizo uses PWM@200Hz between 0-20 OSD config between 21-100 DC modulation and at 20, the brightness is at about 90 cd/m.
And by the way, thin bezels, especially those on newer Dell Ultrasharps are horrible and destroy perceived black levels on IPS panels.
I don't know. It looks unbalanced as shit, I know but it really isn't. The biggest concern is how fragile it is due to the thinness.Also the stand is big enough to fit a PS3/PS4 under it, which is a nice little room saver.They don't make this monitor anymore which is a big fucking shame. I'd buy it again if they did.
U2412MPerfect portrait screen. Nice pixel density for comfy reading and enough space horizontally. Had U2212HM in portrait before and there was a little too little screen real-estate, because I had a horizontal scroll bar on many pages.For gaming I love my U2713HM, but I think I will eventually replace it for a Asus PB27Q.

Is now a good time to buy a monitor, or should I want until all the new gpu's are released? I've got a 290x Tri-X and want to upgrade to 27" 1440 resolution. Should I wait a bit and see if a new freesync comes out or go for something like BenQ?
I posted this a few minutes ago in this thread, 2560x1440, 144hz, freesync Acer.Not shilling, was just wanting feedback/alternatives other than the ridiculously priced BenQ.http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009769
TNIPS or bust
Proper LED backlighting is superior to florescent backlights, problem is its all edgelit shit.
Which display resolution and size its the best for a portrait monitor?
But why? Imagine what that would do to the cost if an IPS monitor with those three features even existed.It'll be a primary monitor, for personal use. It'll always be viewed dead-on. 27" is large enough for some color shift from edge to edge, but I think that's worth living with.
It'd cost about $100 more
I'd pay $100 more for the same thing with IPS as long as the panel is solid and doesn't blur/ghost like a shitter.
but the Asus PB27Q is PLS which is almost the same thing 1440p 100% sRGB 144hz G-Sync.How is PLS your problem?
U2412M uses PWM at 200Hz to dim the backlight. Slightly higher input lag compared to U2415. Otherwise its superior to U2415 Robust, better bezels, mechanical buttons instead of the shit awful touch sensitive "buttons".Eizo EV2436 uses the same panel as U2412M, but is superior in every way: decent QC, assembled in Japan, configurable overdrive, lower input lag, better contrast even if they use the same panel!, 100 times better stand i like the older, very stiff FS2 better, better interpolation and can display lower resolutions without scaling too, flicker free from 90 cd/m2 to 350 cd/m2 brightnessBut all recent and current Dell monitors are shit, because Dell no longer has QC. At all. They have good return policy though. Good luck playing the endless lottery with them though.gamingU2713HMEnjoy that huge input lag.But all TFT monitors mentioned in this thread are crap compared to higher end Eizo and NEC monitors with Sony AG tubes from early new century.
dey be beautiful
The only IPS WHD 100hz freesync monitor I could find that wasn't twice the price of the Acer TN was the Asus MG279Q. They were recalled a month ago due to a lower max refresh with freesync on. I couldn't find any newer info on a fix.Acer's TN is still in the lead for me.

I went from a Sony C520K to an Eizo FG2421 as my gaymen monitor. I much prefer the Eizo with the MVA panel, and the C520K was a flagship photo monitor for its time. Vastly superior contrast and 120Hz at 1920x1080 versus the C520K's 85Hz at 1920x1200 or 100Hz at 1600x1200. The ~16ms of input lag 12ms a non-issue even for Quake and fighting games. And Quake is dead anyways.
hurr I'm an autistEnjoy that huge input lag.yeah it's so big I even have trouble balancing the mouse against that massive 22 ms all in all including switching...You do realize that your 300€ 144hz TN panel with 1ms g2g has probably between 7 and 15ms latency all in all right?you've never played on any decent IPS panels, have you?http://www.prad.de/en/monitore/review/2012/review-dell-u2713hm-part9.html#Laghttp://www.prad.de/new/monitore/test/2014/test-acer-gn246hlbbid-teil7.html#Reaktionsverhalten

Goes to best buy storeSees woman looking over computers and deciding what she likesI ask her what shes looking forCommon habit cause I'm a nice person outside of 4chanshe says she wants a computer that is basically a google/facebook machinetell her about the cheapest alternate option possibleshe is interested because cheaptell her about Ubuntu being a free OSTell her about thinkpads and normally how cheap they areshe has an android phone cause iPhones are too expensive she knows it decently wellshe says she's more interesteddoesn't know that android is linux based. explain it as simple as possibleshe likes that everything is freeasks me for a way to contact her and vise versaweek later text her and ask if she still wants helpsays she went with windows cause she already knows it and is not ready for a new OSOP sorry to say that NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ABOUT LINUX unless they are server people or "but muh security!"Seriously, the "year of the Linux desktop" isn't going to happen for a long ass time. Not until Windows finally crash and burns. As long as Apple and Windows are around you don't really have a chance to be "mastur race" sorry OP
Well desktop distros are now very usable for the user, finally surpassing OS X and are closing the gap on the amount of applications that windows has over linux.
More people use XP, a dated and now unsupported version of Windows, than every single distro combined. See 
The funny thing is that Linux has taken over in just about every area except desktop. Linux will probably never take over PC desktop because Microsoft is so deeply rooted in with the manufacturers.
But the desktop is dead so that's irrelevant
implying the average PC users knows / cares what windows is
Is there seriously that many idiots using 7 instead of 8.1?
Get out of here, Bill. No one wants your shitty Windows 8.1 here.
dood, windows 8.1 is so fucking shit. don't pretend its cool or good. WHY do you want metro?Why do you not want to run old programs? I love the sims complete collection and it has a VERY hard time running on it.aside from that it has the hardest time running Steam games cause they crash all the time. So fuck off windows 8Not even Gates likes 8. He installed it and it crashed on him in the installation
yfw more computers run linux than windows and OSX combinedThank you android.
depends, are you talking about tablets and other devices out side of computers themselves?Cause I did have an HDD with kitkat on it but I could never get it to run right.
Oh look, it's people who haven't ever used 8.1
I've had a laptop and a desktop running Windows 8.1 practically since release and have never once had a game in my 100+ game steam library crash on me for OS related reasons
this is some next level bait right here

mfw my family runs Xubuntu since 2 years and never had an issue.Windows: 3 times/week ... "Anon, help me.", "Anon, why is this PC so slow ?"
Ι'd јust like tο interјect fοr a mοment. What yοu're referring tο as Linux, is in fact, GΝU/Linux, οr as Ι've recently taken tο calling it, GΝU plus Linux. Linux is nοt an οperating system untο itself, but rather anοther free cοmpοnent οf a fully functiοning GΝU system made useful by the GΝU cοrelibs, shell utilities and vital system cοmpοnents cοmprising a full OS as defined by ΡOSΙX.Many cοmputer users run a mοdified versiοn οf the GΝU system every day, withοut realizing it. Τhrοugh a peculiar turn οf events, the versiοn οf GΝU which is widely used tοday is οften called "Linux", and many οf its users are nοt aware that it is basically the GΝU system, develοped by the GΝU Ρrοјect.Τhere really is a Linux, and these peοple are using it, but it is јust a part οf the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the prοgram in the system that allοcates the machine's resοurces tο the οther prοgrams that yοu run. Τhe kernel is an essential part οf an οperating system, but useless by itself; it can οnly functiοn in the cοntext οf a cοmplete οperating system. Linux is nοrmally used in cοmbinatiοn with the GΝU οperating system: the whοle system is basically GΝU with Linux added, οr GΝU/Linux. All the sο-called "Linux" distributiοns are really distributiοns οf GΝU/Linux.
this is made upyou don't go to a best buy, explain linux to a girl, and get her number

Anybody have any experience with this?Computer pleb looking to get away from gmail I hate it.What provider do you use, any recommendations?
I'm using Protonmail and I like it.The only problems are that you need two password. One to login one to decrypt your mailbox.You also can't use IMAP/POP3.Great provider otherwise.
Cockmail
so you can't use it with k9 mail on android then?
You also can't use IMAP/POP3.
Nope. Just the web version from the browser.
I got invited a month ago. I love it. Use it for my online alias whenever I sign up on forums, gaming sites or anything like that.
Well the security which is PM's entire reason for existing would go away if you did.
They already said they plan to add support for it later in a news post. It is still in development.
what is S/MIME
use it for my online alias whenever I sign up on forums, gaming sites or anything like thatYou may as well use gmail for innocent things like those, right? I'm still waiting for my invite, it's been a few months now.
I have an account, but as soon as they roll out a mobile client I'll switch to is at my main account and drop gmail.Until then it's fairly useless to me.
I've had a protonmail account for a while now but I haven't really had any cause to use it.That said. It would be nice to switch some of my more important accounts and stuff to it. But the fact that I have to juggle two emails would be a bit annoying. At least with gmail I can have stuff forwarded to my main account for easy access.Important stuff on Proton, random websites that doesn't use any personal info, gmail, throwaway/10 minute mail type shit on my Cockli account.
Well that was just examples. I use it for my torrent sites, bitcoin and sites I don't want associated with my gmail, which is composed of my name
You also can't use IMAP/POP3.Wow, this is worse than Gmail
2 gmails2 protonmails1 cockmail1 openmailbox1 lavaboom
I used Hushmail for a while but when I heard of Protonmail I immediately decided to switch to it.After registering I waited for the reply but then my computer crashed and I was removed from the rest of the world for 3 weeks and no more hope of recieving that e-mail.
I use it for "official" stuff that is directly related to me and my name, I'll also use it for job applications 'n stuff to keep my personal things personal. I use gmail with a fake name for things like forums and random signups etc.ProtonMail is awesome and I hope to see a mobile app from them soon. The browser version isn't bad though. One of the best features besides general privacy is the fact that you can send self destructing emails imo, it's not necessary but its a neat feature.
I wish I had the courage to clear up all my email addresses.I'd like to do this:one Protonmail for Paypal/Bank account/Official stuffone Gmail for any google related serviceone shitty trash mail for forums/shady sites/etcSeems good enough.
What provider do you use, any recommendations?I run my own server at home. It has exim4, alpine and dovecotNot recommended, it's a hassle. Reasonably private though I suppose.
yeah i ran home mail server and its a fucking pain in the ass. also so many places will flag you as spam even with proper dns entries as you are on an isp consumer address so fuck you. now i just use outlook.com and encrypt everything client side with gpg when needed. much fucking easier even if i do lose some privacy. oh well.
I've had a hotmail since 2000, never had a problem with it.
I also recently switched to Outlook.com. It is the only service that works on all mobile platforms without issue.
Absolutely fuck all to do with this
Hey, does anyone know where to begin looking for how to run programs from a USB stick plugged into a television?  Insignia is the brand I'm looking at, now, and I'm not entirely sure it's possible.  My guess would be that I'd need to start with adjusting the Firmware settings, but I'm not sure where to go from there.  Basically, anything that opens the door to more possibilities, provided I can read up on them, is great. Thanks.
OP Here.Also worth noting:  It has a default utility for media from the USB ports which doesn't seem to be programmed especially well, but I'm thinking more in terms of what can be manipulated.
Unless you happen to be some great programmer with low level experience –which I can tell you are not from your post –this isn't going to happen.Just buy an intel compute stick

Because they are to retarded to even install Antergos, Ubuntu, or mint.
Mint and Ubuntu are the only legitimate things not worth installing. Ubuntu is justifiable because of the support and how easy it is to use, but Mint is just Cinnamon DE with tons of shit preinstalled. It's the Windows of Linux Distros.
OS X is better for desktop use, and has more commercial application support. Why would I use Linux when I can run everything I neeced in Linux plus things OS X can that Linux can't?Also why would someone use Linux when the BSD family is objectively superior?

Out of curiosity, why not Racket? I'm a beginning Common Lisper with little experience in either
Racket forces you to use classes to do anything serious, and it does it in the worst possible way, by introducing new syntax punctuation [ and ] which thows the entire concept of homoiconicity out the window.Chicken just gives me functions from C libraries and lets me do what I want with them.
Not that classes and oop can't be great in small doses when done well I just don't like being forced to use them to do simple things like opening graphicsIf I was ok with oop being forced everywhere, I'd use Kawa
by introducing new syntax punctuation [ and ] which thows the entire concept of homoiconicity out the window.What are you talking about? [ and ] are synonyms for  and  and even { and }. You can use them interchangeably throughout you program so long as they properly match.
you can use them interchangeablydisgustingThat makes me like racket even less
I thought that  interchangeability was part of the Scheme standard.
this.And where does it states that you're forced to use classes?or give examples
that completely takes away the homoiconicity of lisp, I would never use anything but parens in any lisp codeThe gui module is completely dependent on oopgtk is not
No. It doesn't. Do you even know what homoiconicity means?
The homoiconicity is one syntax for everythingparens and s-expressions for functions, conditions, lists, everything
homoiconicity in this context means the same list structure for code and data. Even though you have [] and {} in the language it all means the same, you can still treat the source code as a list
Homoiconicity is not dependent on parentheses. You can have homoiconicity with curly brackets, brackets, or even angle brackets, etc.
Still looks ugly as fuck if they're intermixed
see
I would never use anything but parens in any lisp codeThen don't, but people are going to call you out on your shit if there's a style guide that says to use brackets.
I disagree.  It provides visual distinction to certain areas of code, and makes things more readable.
I agree with this. There's nothing philosophically wrong with a Lisp that behaves this way.
Going out the way of the thread a little bit to address the title.What's going on mister? Are you tired of Lisp or just the /g/ space dedicated to it?
I think they've gotten tired of making new threads. They've been really slow and dying quickly lately. : Let's get some action in here guys.
I can't believe that you are ditching a well documented language with one of the best communities just because a syntax issue that's completely optional. Who gives a damn if people call you out for not using brackets?
I was actually tired when I made the thread.   is also right, however.I'm getting sick of /g/.  I've largely stopped browsing many threads here asides from this one.  I'm glad the general on Lainchan has started picking up some.Just look at the catalog here.  It's saddening for anyone actually interested in technology to see good threads with so little replies, yet see that bait, consumerism, opinion-listing, and shitposting threads are usually successful and hit the bump limit.
It's not just that, I don't like that they force you to use classes to use a lot of their modules
Yeah I've been browsing lainchan a lot more lately as well. I wish they had a bit more traffic overall but then again it is a good way of keeping out the "muh gpu" morons. Thanks for keeping up the generals here : Your work is duly appreciated.
yeah thanks for making these threads, I've been posting on the lainchan thread too.It's been a few months since I last posted here, but I remember back then the lisp threads used to have a lot more people.I don't know if those people have gone away, the fact that may is a horrible month because a lot of students have finals me included or both.
As I said one or two threads before, we should casually mention the lainchan thread here and there or even in the pastebin so people can gradually move towards that.
incf this
There should be better ways out there to help the Lisp community. Maybe 4chan is just not the place to do this.There should be a good balance between a well-sized group and still be underdogs, because everything that grows enough tends to get bastardized.
the main problem with the /g/ lisp threads is they keep dropping off the board after about 10 or 15 posts so there is no way to carry on serious discussians. I am going to start spending more time on the lainchan lisp threadIm not sure if you are aware, but this clojurians thing is a private live chat for clojure

Is Racket GUI Documentation gtk, qt4 or independent?
Best scheme/lisp to use?Looking for something with lots of batteries that respects my freedoms.
that respects my freedoms.by your freedoms you are of course referring to the the freedom that Richard Stallman gives you. I think we should be clear, there are many kinds of freedoms, but the freedom you enjoy is that of Richard Stallman
The API they provide is platform independent. The implementations try to use native widgets. On *nix, I think they're using GTK.
Racket sounds like it fits the bill.
 lots of batteriesRacket.
The only time I've had to use classes in Racket was when I had to do GUI programming. I'm not even sure what a class-free GUI lib would look like.

What do you think of youtube's design, /g/?
looks better
UI is still awkward to use on a touchscreen
It's gone through many ups and downs, and while it can never be as good as it was when it was born 05-06, it's mad decent at the moment.
autoplay
I purposely avoid forming opinions on Youtube's UI because I know they'll just change it again next month.
Would be nice if they weren't covering up the video.
it automatically fades when you move your mouse awayif that doesn't make sense, the controls only show up when you hover over the video
Indifferent. I've hidden most it.Agreed. It looks nice but I don't really mind the 30 or so pixels that the old controls took up.
I got really pissed when I had to make that extra click to switch the quality. Why can't they just give everything under the gear menu its own spot? CC has one, why not everything else?
why not just get a script that auto sets quality to the one you want?
That would surely confuse and disorient the user!
my shitty youtube css
Why did they remove the option to stop playlists from autoplaying. This is fucking annoying. They probably only do that shit so they have something to show to their superiors in future. 'And by the way, we added an option to stop playlists from automatically switching to the next video since the feedback we got said this shit is fucking annoying.'
I like it, the design is really nice and the functionality is still there. It's a bit buggy though, especially in the settings tray.
why is your search bar different
I still have the old design
aero controls
not sure? i wasnt aware youtube updated its looks

GIB ME THE CANCER B0SS
Literally how?All i have at the moment is still the shitty black default or a broken youtube center.
eyy b0ss
so how do you get this new uii have the grey bar and i want to be in the future
Didn't have time to make a sacrifice this year
Remember the times when the very old YouTube design allowed you to change quality with just one click.One click. Then it became two clicks. Now it will be three clicks.Thanks Obama.
hey guys, meaning to ask for some time now, is franku really that faggy kid in the Filthy Frank Exposed or was he just pretending and acting like a little gay boi just to troll people?Can't tell
Doesn't look like that for me OP
Dreadful and broken.
Google might have the smartest and most talented people in the world, but their UI teams are retarded.
Yes that is the real George MillerYou can see if you stalk his vines and instagram stuff and joji vlogsI wonder why he took the exposed video down tho
I still force my design
Seconded its retarded that you have to sell your soul to the botnet to keep from watching the same shit meme channels as everyone else.
jesus, he looks soo faggy, but at least he has a good sense of humour
How do you  get that UI ?
All of this is under Firefox 36.0.1 using the YouTube ALL HTML5 version 2.1.3.1-signedThat's related to the one question I've had for a while when setting options.  I come across 4 types of video UIs with 2 subtypes:1. Settings menu with no options for CC2. Settings menu with the option for CC3. Settings menu AND the CC menu with CC settings not in Settings menu usually is in the Settings menu at first, then it disappears when the CC button appears4. Settings menu AND the CC menu where the options can be set from either.Take the above with the two variants:a. Options for showing/hiding annotations is present in the Settings menu.b. Options for showing/hiding annotations is present in the Settings menu.I used to assume that it was always the same player, but I guess not?More complaints:Sometimes the CC option is a menu, other times it is a button.The modes available theater mode, fullscreen, whatever should be in a single menu with the option to pop-out.  I actually wound up making a local html page with the embed code so I can have the popped out video window.  Since you can move it and it automagically rescales the video to the window size, if you are trying to compare something in 2 or more videos, it's kinda nice.Sometimes the autoplay or playlist navigation back button is missing but the forward one is still there, so you can skip forward to the next video in the line, but not back.I would love to see a loop/repeat button on the player UIAnyone else encounter similar things?
joji vlogsI though he killed the joji blogs too?
Still looks like this for me and it's still shit.
I wonder if he was scared of getting doxxed
His autistic fanbase lost their shit because they apparently can't handle the truth. Nice Trips BTW.
obsuring 16:9 video with control overlaygreat, we really need those extra verticle pixels to show inane comments.
How do you get the new design?

the more they update youtube, the more garbage it becomes. comment section is censored, video searches are manipulated, fucking font changes several times a year.. just play stupid fucking video for me you fucking cunts.
or you can go to youtube testtube and enable it.
no way I'm filling all this just to try a shitty new player
Really nice.Love the way it looks, the white/black bar was too noticeable
not just playing youtube videos with your media player of choice

lg stylo is great.
G4 is $599, cheapest 2015 flagship we have. One employee has it already and is in love, got the leather back it feels really nice.Other than that the g3 is still a good buy at like $430
Also at this point I wouldn't recommend the n6, I'm using one and am going to jump to the g4 soon. Its not bad but its nothing special and not worth the money
The Nexus phones are never anything specialGoogle can fuck go fuck themselves with a cactus selling that shit for $649

Some years back, everyone used to rave about how great they were. Then they started going cheap, lost a lot of their good engineers, hurt their reputation, and bled a lot of their business. I think they tried to reverse course, but were never the same. These days, they're barely mentioned anymore. As such, I'm not really sure where they lie in terms of quality or pricing anymore.[1]Likewise, I agree. They are not as good as they used to be.I believe LizardSquad skids also booted their core routers off and caused massive backbone outages, but that's not really an argument.[1]: https://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1456153&p=9374582#post9374582

Your post is a train wreck, mild in comparison to your poor personal attack.
I tell them that I charge $250/hour for labor, four hour minimum, plus expenses which will include alcohol. I will also need them to sign a contract limiting my liability.Unless you're under my roof, you don't get free support. My parents and siblings may pay with a nice meal or similar offering.I'm not an idiot. I got out of help desk work for a reason and my free time is worth more to me than being the nice guy. I don't ask them for free help with my taxes, or my car, or my plumbing, so if they take offense, they can fuck right off.
I charge 90$/hr 1 hr minimum. I actually like doing some work here and there.
just do her ...
I don't charge my family anything. My more distant friends have started offering me 10-20€ for rather simple fixes, that seems low, but I don't care since they are good friends I have known for a decade. Beers are okay too.

What distro should I install to a t520 if I've never installed loonix before? I'm thinking of Fedora, but I've been reading Fedora isn't that user friendly and doesn't support non-free software like steam.
Ubuntu.
48220984Xubuntu. It's like Ubuntu, but with less spyware and better desktop. Ridiculously easy to install
This.  There is literally nothing wrong with Ubuntu. Also consider Mint.Under the hood Mint and many others are Ubuntu and just as user-friendly as the next.  It's really all about what desktop environment appeals to you.  XFCE, MATE, Unity, Cinnamon, GNOME, KDE, etc.Go watch some jewtube videos and see what DE jumps out at you.  You can install multiple DEs should all be available in Software Center or whatever and fuck around with them yourself if you want.

I am the only one who thinks Google Now, Siri, Cortana etc. are completely useless?I never use any "voice control" crap and have never seen anyone use them either.
I like the Amazon one actually.
I disable that, always. Drains battery and I never use it.
I agree they are useless for everyone that has hands.It's neat to impress your grandma with though.
Siri is only useful for setting up alarms.
No, you're not.It never seriously, never understands you the first time, you look like a fucktard using it in public, and the results are never worth the effort.
LOOK MOM NO HANDS
I don't want other people hearing my commands and I can't speak at the right volume so it can understand me while still being quiet.
Text-to-speech and google voice functions on the S5 are actually pretty legit.It's great for driving, being able to hold a button and say "ok google, take me to [place]" and it gets it right the first time, 95% of the time. It's surprisingly accurate, especially since the similar functions on my old S3 were fucking worthless. Does most other voice-typical functions pretty well, although all things considered, I make pretty light use of it.Just saying, it's not ideal, but it's getting significantly better with every new iteration, to the point where it's becoming a desirable feature.
Evertime I say "OK Google" I can't stop feeling like a retard. tfw I wanted to show voice recognition to someone and it didn't worked ;-;
Thing is, I would really love to use the "Ok, Google" feature on my phone but assbackwards laws in Germany prevent me from doing that. The entire service is not available due to privacy concerns.Privacy concerns? On a device that tracks me 24/7 anyway? Oh wow!
siri is shit, started calling people when i asked her to change to next song
google is the worst with its "ok google", just name it something.
Google now voice search is only really useful for me when I'm driving. That being said, the information it displays for you can be very helpful and relevant and hopefully the new functionality they're adding with M will be even more useful. I personally think Now is way ahead of Siri and Cortana.
Okay Google comes outBe hanging out with friend"Hey check this out""Okay Google"Nothing"O-okay Google?"Nope"G-google...?"The shame will never go away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGU-SqUTeesNot bad, im impressed...
I tried out Siri and was impressed by how well it understands things but it's a gimmick at best right now.
It's only been out since Nov 2014 and it's capable of all this stuff. GOD Amazon is doing great things with Echo. PLUS it isn't only stuck on your phone.
setting alarms while in bed without having to take the phonesetting navigation targets in carThose are the two big use-cases, everything else is just gimmicky shit.Especially using it on a computer desktop is retarded.
Yeah man using android is pretty shameful.. hope you got an iphone now
I have my Google Now hooked up to Tasker and AutoVoice for voice commands. I made one for my car that turns on bluetooth, shuts off wifi, and opens G-music.
I use them pretty regularly for navigation. It's usually faster to say "Ok Google: Navigate to 123 Dank Meme Drive" than to open Navigation, search for an address, and hit navigate.
this too."Ok Google: Wake me up at 8AM" is usually the faster method as well.

Holy shit that's a terrible computer. You could probably get away with a 400 or 450 watt PSU tho. I have a 4690k+r9 290 and i am using a 600 watt.Why does your family computer need a video card? I don't see an SSD. There is no need for a heatsink when you are using an i3. If it is a family computer convince your poor ass family to pay a bit extra and get at least an i5 or just end your pathetic life.
used thinkpad, or macintosh
Well meme'd.
Alright I'll probably lower the power supply then. Want to have a bit of room for expansion though.I have a video card in so my siblings can play some games lightly.Fuck you bitch.
Get rid of the cooler, replace the RAM with cheaper RAM, replace the WD black with a WD blue the newest models perform the same. You can now upgrade the 750 to a 750ti for your gaymen to be a little better, we know that's what you're doing kid.
There isn't going to be room for expansion with the i3. The heatsink is a total waste of money since stock voltages can run fine on the intel cooler.
Not trying to game, just want it to be a possibility for my siblings. I don't have time to play much while I'm in college.Thanks for the suggestions.Thanks for the input.

I spent an unacceptable amount of time yesterday migrating a user from a Motorola Moto G to an LG G3.  What took the most time was moving the SMS/MMS--this took hours 16K SMS/350 MMS.  I used the Easy Backup & Restore app on the Play Store, saved the backup from the Moto G on the SD card, moved the SD card to the LG G3, and the restoration function took hours.On my own devices, I have a paid backup app MyBackup Root so I haven't had to deal with normie issues like lack of root and no proper app to work with.  The Motorola Migrate app is great for moving to a Motorola device but it's no help moving off of one.  The G3 didn't appear to have a migration app or maybe I hid it as one of the AT&T bloat apps.Anyhoo, enough rambling.  What should I have done?  I can't babysit phones for hours while they mine bitcoins in the background and pretend moving 16k text messages is time consuming.
Offtopic bump question: does Windows 10 Mobile have the equivalent of root and launchers?  Can Windows Phones be debloated without voiding the warranty?  Can I use one and ditch the Fisher Price tile interface?
what prevents you from just installing android on a windows phone?
Can Windows Phones be debloatedWindows Phones don't usually come with bloat. And if they do, you can just uninstall it.You can't change anything. No launchers, nothing. You can't even change the music player nor the Internet browser.
Assuming the same model of phone like HTC's M8 has both Android and Windows versions available, nothing, as I understand it.
How about telling whoever you did this for to not worry about 16 thousand SMS texts that don't mean anything after a day.
cool, would still not buy a winphone tho
why didn't you sync everything with your google account, stupid goyim?
don't mind me
You can't change anything. No launchers, nothing. You can't even change the music player nor the Internet browser.Well, horse hockey.I'm ready to ditch Android.  I'm sick to the gills with this "gotta have root to delete system apps" and "root voids warranty" trash.  Wanna really fix Android M?  Lemme debloat it without it removing the warranty.
I could have but after the backup was created in a few minutes and then I started the restore function on the new phone, I kinda assumed it wouldn't take hours.Do none of you guys have a procedure for this?
Nexus. No bloat. Pure Android.
use one of these. a lot fasteralthough, the thing itself runs xp, and licenses are super expensive.
I have a Nexus 4.I still have to install stock, flash updates, and then root again.  Because it's a junk Nexus, there's no SD so I have to juggle backups to a PC and then back for a restore.The Nexus 6 is overpriced garbage.  I wouldn't recommend a Nexus device to a user.
Considering Google Play Edition phones are no longer being sold and Android One is only being sold in developing countries, Nexus phones are pretty much the last remaining bastion for AOSP.
Thanks for the response.  Do you actually use one of these?
Dammit Tom, you used to be cool.
because i have one at work, yes. dunno how easy it is to get one for personal usage.
Try using SMS Backup by Ritesh in the Play Store. For backup and restore of around 10000 SMS and about 500MMS it take a total of maybe 15 minutes. Maybe less.
I did grab that initially but it didn't handle call log/bookmarks/dictionary--in fact, I don't think it handled MMS...checking...nah, you're correct.Hey, if only Google implemented a Migration feature for these billions of devices they want sold and upgraded...
What should I have done?You should have told them SMS is not a photo album. Seriously, who keeps  16000 SMS messages on their fucking phone? I delete that shit a few days after the conversation.
blahblahblah I don't know how eitherThanks for your input, teenaged /g/.
Alright, so far I have Easy Backup & Restore for everything not SMS/MMS and SMS Backup & Restore for SMS/MMS.What about user apps APKs + data?  I tried the free version of MyBackup; it refuses to restore to a different device but the ZIP archive had the apps in it so I manually restored those.
Easy Backup & Restore has the function for apps but I'll be having to flash Android R by the time it's finished.I might try the entire app again to see if I just had a fluke run or something.
I'm 26.I wouldn't even bother looking it up because what's the point? Why would anyone need all these conversations stored on their phone? Tell them you can't migrate SMS/MMS or something, these people are like hoarders but digital.
I don't care why they want it.  I just care how I can do it.  This is how I maintain my technical superiority and console myself because I couldn't amass sixteen thousand texts if I lived a century.
what does /g/ think of GWT?My manager wants me to use it to develop the frontend for some java web service. I've always used the traditional web stack for this kind of stuff, but I must admit it works out pretty good after all.
I have a video clip that I would like to export the frames into an image somewhat similar to picture attached.I know VLC Player can capture frames and save them into individual image files, but I am looking for something that makes it into one file for a better overview.
Jesus christ, optimize your shit.

I was going to replace my GTX 580 with a 970, but ive been hearing lately mostly from /v/ that its a memecard which under performs its specified specs, will a 960 do?
Do for what? DO WHAT? YOU FUCKING MORON
Just get a 980 and stop being poor
Yes it is a meme card, I'm shocked that /v/ has finally realised this. Just get a 290X or a 980 and be done with it. 960 is an even more meme-ish card, and really isn't worth it.
watch youtube videos obviouslyi think the most demanding games i want to run will be the witcher 2/3, it doesn't have to max them eitherim the last white person left in london m8
New cards are coming in June so you should wait before purchasing. Might save yourself 50 or so bucks or he'll, just get the new cards.
3.5 gigs

The human eye can't see more than 3.5 RAM
This benchmark has no significant meaning to most people.
It shows a 150$ 270 card out peforming a 700$ 980 at 4k underload.Tell me how that isn't significant you fucking muppet.DX12 and its over for nvidia
4KImplying anyone with sense is dropping $1000+ on a 27" monitorMonitor tech needs to catch up and offer reasonable options on these resolutions before I give a shit about these benchmarks.
top kek
Wait 1 more week and you can buy a R9 380/380X which will be better than a 960 in every way.
the marketing material for AMD shows a very, very specific scenario and set of statistics that favors AMDGolly. Consider me educated.
1960 is still worse2 970 still runs exceptionally well with good value.  3980 is hundreds of dollars more for maybe 5 extra FPS in most scenarios.  Overpriced as fuckThese are the facts.  Either get the 970 never had issues with it.  If you play 4K steer clear tho  Or wait till new cards come out.
these benchmarks prove glaring inefficiency with our gtx range at higher resolutionsquickly damage 1080p is all you need
wait until AMD launcher their new lineup.Nvidia will most likely drop their prices, or you can pick up some juicy new tech
I only like my cherry picked benchmarks in favour of nvidiaNvidia consumers are no better than iPhone users. Premium price for shit performance
if you play 4kYou're correct on all points, but I have no idea why I keep seeing this "not for 4k" thing mentioned on so many cards.If you own a 4k monitor, you're already in another tier of disposable income entirely, and probably already have a couple of unreasonably pricey blast furnaces in SLI/Crossfire.but what about when 4k becomes affordableYou mean three generations of GPUs later? Tell me how your card fares in 1080p at that point.
posting actual marketing materialI see the AMD shills have dropped the pretense of being "just so happy with my purchase man".
fuck yeah man, you'll be good. 960 kills most games I've been playing. GTAV Maxed out at 70FPS.
Just get a 970 or 290X.
Woah, fucking AMD overpricing the 290x. Gonna get a 260x now, only 25% slower and 1/5 price
What res tho
970 is gud I love mine, glad I didn't get memed and buy a 290x
Wait for the GTX 980 Ti launch and see how the GTX 980 is priced
I build rigs for normies as a hobby and generally try to guide them towards the "sweet spot" for their builds. Don't spend too much, don't spend too little; an investment based on meeting their needs, to the best of my ability.I've done seven rigs for gaming and the owners are all proper chuffed with the 970strix cards I recommended and inevitably put in the build.They're gaming at 1080p at 120hz for two on new releases. They want to be able to max their favorite games with unfaltering performance, and they got exactly that without overspending. They're reported zero issues with the card even when they jack the settings up as high as they'll go, and believe me, these people aren't shy with questions or complaints.The cards are quiet, powerful, and the fact that they run relatively cool bodes well for the general lifespan on the build.muh 3.5Breaking 3.5 takes effort outside of a few select read: poorly optimized and/or proud-to-be-highly-demanding games. It'll be at least two generations before 4gb VRAM minimum becomes a requisite for high-end gaming, at which point they can invest in another mid-tier card for around the same price. They're getting very good performance and longevity for a reasonable price of admission, which is precisely my goal when advising or building for a client. Even if they don't want to upgrade later for some reason, they can keep trimming settings and making do for a long time to come.Listen, you're on 4chan. Shitposting isn't just par for the course here, it's an attractive feature and selling point for a lot of users. There's bits and pieces of genuinely good advice floating around on this site, but the vast majority of posters here are just looking to argue and shit on things for its own sake. Try not to lose touch with that fact.
960 is overpriced, 970 is a memecard.Get a 280x, much better value/dollar and much faster than a 960.
viste que eres marico? :v
My 970 just died.  Going to RMA.
this
GTA V is a decently well optimized game that doesn't REALLY flaunt its graphical capabilities and I was able to break the 3.5 threshold at 1080p.OP, knowing what I knew back when I bought my 970, I'd buy the 970 again. Knowing what I know now I'd look elsewhere. Honestly I'd have probably just bought a 750 Ti or used my 650 Ti BOOST and saved until the 980 Ti came out.
970 is still king of price/performance, dont shill low end amd here pls
I can nearly max Witcher 3 on my 970.Hairworks crashes it though which is annoying.
The GTX 960 has 2Gbs of vram. Since GTA V requires more than that when maxed out, what you said is literally impossible.
So I just read about that Nvidia Shield console that was released on a hardware site.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFZfCBXw6K4It seems like as a general rule AMD's competition with Intel, Nvidia and others try more things following trends and I was just wondering to myself what does AMD do that's new? Their last big new thing has been APUs but that was a while ago and it hasn't really caught on past success of having them in consoles now for this generation, I would consider that their only giant money maker besides their smaller customer base with desktop fans of generally budget computers.So is Samsung going to buy em out? Or are they going to get over this bit since the mid 2000s where they havent really adapted in the mobile age now like other companies?90% Of the processor/discrete graphics cards threads on this board are about waiting for AMD  product ____ for like 5+ years now. I personally last used their 6300 fx product in a friend's budget PC build, but personally I havent had anything since the 7970, which didnt have much dev or amd support especially with vidya for the main reason I got it.So realistically what the fuck is going to happen? Will the gov bail em out or is someone going to gobble em up? A monopoly with Intel or Nvidia or some other competitor of theirs wont happen. That would be worst case.
I was just wondering to myself what does AMD do that's new? This is either bait or you're so unbelievably out of the loop it's like you don't even know what components are in your PC
Mantel is a big one, considering dx12 is essentially just mantle.Freesync is pretty awesome considering its every bit as good as gsync, but doesn't really cost anything extra for hardware or licensing.They dont really have the money to continually invest in risky new hardware or features. Atm they've dumped everything they have into the fiji card and upconing zen r&d. Not like being bought by samsung would help with innovation. They've been playing follow the leader in the mobile market for years. Just so happens idiots buy their shit phones more.
You don't need 80% marketshare to stay relevant. It's this weird American way of thinking that the company sucks unless it's absolutely ruling the market and doubling the revenue every quarter.
Shame then they don't really get any credit then as it's still Microsoft Direct X.I'm excited for DX12 for combining discrete gpu vram, as I often lately for the past 5+ years have a multi gpu setup a lot.Freesync and Gsync honestly Ill never use probably. I can't say which one is better out of these two. Nvidia does have more "features" that seem to work better though like Shadowplay that I actually do use but I realize this isn't what everyone uses so maybe Freesync/gsync are something major for someone that doesnt want to share gameplay, or does using other programs just as good.
I was just wondering to myself what does AMD do that's new? You mean like APUs, HSA, HBM...?
Well there are negatives, it isn't like the dev support and their $$$ to release products as quickly are pros being a bit far behind in 2nd place lately.These are two things that actually affect how you are enjoying a product of theirs, especially one that can be updated by em like a video card with problem X with software.
Created HSA and founded the HSA foundationContributed Mantle to Khronos Groupnow called VulkanContributed TressFxContributed FreesyncCollaborated with SK Hynix and created HBM DRAM
Nothing has caught on or followed trends of any other technology from other companies that have been successful of their competition with people jumping on board.
Even Nvidia is going to use HBM in their next gen cards. How is that not "caught on"? Oh, and Vulcan is basically Mantle by a different name.
AMD is a rip-off copy-cat company and that's OK.
Every single current gen console is AMD.
This.  People keep thinking "Nintendo is going to go out of business because they aren't #1 in the video game industry!" with this reasoning.It is not a zero sum game.  Just because one company makes more than another doesn't mean the other company isn't making a profit.
Nintendo just started making a profit, the last time they made one was in 2011.
you people are all forgetting the most important thing.DDR.
implying that innovation is the best business strategyAMD is the Zynga of computing.Actually, they're nowhere near that awful.  AMD provides some great value processors.  I run an 8350 and I'm very happy with it.
implying that innovation is the best business strategySadly this
Sadly, nothing.There's nothing wrong with targeting specific business segments.  Why does AMD have to go after, say, the high-end server market?  It doesn't.There's sort of an over-obsession with the concept of the value of competition.  Yeah, some degree of competition is great for the consumer.  Constant, innovating competition?  Not so much.Take a look at computing in the 1980s.  Apple II vs TRS vs C64 vs a million other completely independent platforms.  About the only unifying thing I can think of was the ubiquity of BASIC, which doesn't mean much when RAM and basic features vary so wildly.Look at the early 1990s.  x86 vs 68k vs RISC.  Windows vs OS/2 vs Mac OS vs BeOS vs Amiga OS vs a million others.  You know how many people threw away money and time on dead-end platforms?And now what do we have?  Primarily an x86 world, because it turns out outright innovation isn't as valuable as ubiquitous optimization of accepted standards.Here's another example:  motorcycle and by extension, mountain bike forks.  They're a terrible solution to the problem of front-end suspension.  They're high friction.  They change the steering geometry drastically when you brake.In the early 1990s we saw lots of innovation.  Weird braking systems that boosted fork stiffness terrible, because you'd still hit bumps that needed absorbing, and the systems were heavy and prone to failure, the GTS1000 and Bimota front-end swingarm systems that were extremely heavy, very complex, and limited turning radius.Now what do we have?  Titanium nitride coated, and now 'diamond' coated forks.  Larger diameters and upside down forks for greater stiffness.You don't need big innovation and wild new directions.  You just need improvement.  And companies just have to provide VALUE, not necessarily innovation.
Lets see here...They created a better graphics API which is the base of DirectX12 and VulcanThey invented the first APU which intel now copiesThey created HBMThey created a free and non proprietary version of GSyncAnd you wonder why theyre still alive...Intel and Nvidia dont make anything new, they just step into markets that already exist to compete. Maybe they integrate some new business technology within their own existing technology but they arnt breakthroughs.
Mantle, APUs/HSA, 3D stacked memory, Trueaudio.Combine those three and you have all the components for a AAA gaming system on one chip.
They invented the first APU which intel now copiesNo. SoCs with on die graphics existed long before AMD launched Llano in 2011.Intel had on die graphics long before Llano.APU is nothing but a marketing name for an SoC, AMD didn't invent them, and intel certainly isn't copying them.
Price vs performance AMD always wins. You get a bit less performance for 10-20% less money.Intel wins performance wise outright though, but be prepared to shell out more shekels, you filthy goy.
Which won't happen until 2017. Two years away.
Gotta get those Zen CPUs out first.
Shield is a joke that noone cares about.
With that timeline you had better hope that their next APU is Zen+ based.Because unless they come to market with an Excavator+ based APU with significantly larger IGP in 2016 then they'll have nothing to fill the void for an entire calendar year. Carrizo is too small of a performance uplift over Kaveri, a Carrizo refresh just won't cut it.
nvidia makes a roku-like thing-a-ma-jigAMD IS FINISHED/g/ - Tecnology
An APU shares shit between GPU and CPU.A SoC and Intels thing don't.
AMD/ATI are firsts for a lot of game changing technologies:1Ghz64bitdual,quad and octo core CPUsDX9, 10, 10.1, 11 and soon 12And now they're pushing and leading in other stuff:OpenCLHSA and SoCsHBMMantle/Vulkan & DX12To say they're not doing anything new just shows how stupid you are, they're the only company out their pushing stuff for the entire industry, without them we'd still be in 2010.

Don't buy used you'll regret it
I say no, but I know nothing about whatever keyboard that is or keyboards in general really
I cant speak for the abomination they've done with the top right, but I owned a first generation for a few years and it was reliable and pleasant to use, if a bit cheap feeling keycaps all had a bit of wiggle
Really? why?
I have it.I don't love the USB thing on the right, since it get on the way of the mouse but other than that is a tank.
Which switches do you have?
I have the model before that one.. the before they put that eyesore on the top right

OP could do worse.
I have one using browns, it's pretty nice. I like having the media keys and the volume knob comes in handy sometimes. It's my first mechanical though so I have nothing to compare it to beyond pictures, where I think it holds up well aesthetically.
No, don't fall for the mechanical keyboard memethere is literally _no_ benefit in using mechanical memeboardsbesides the time you can waste on ricing it with o-rings, leds and cleaning it
Of course not. It's a fucking used keybord, it's barely worth 3 $
he doesn't play compeetitive rythym games

Where the fuck can you get it for $90? It's ~$185 here.
www.ibuyusedcrapformanymanyshekels-com.ru :^
Don't buy it. Get an IBM model M instead.
rubber domes aren't 100% accurate, that matters when you're going for s/ss ranks in songs which require thousands of keypresses. Not to mention the benefits of lower activation force and different switch advantages. I use a rubber dome and rythym games is the one aspect where having the benefits of mechanical feel they'd matter. Other than that and probably a few other select examples theres ofcourse no NEED for mechanical. But hey, why buy a mercedes when a kia will take you from a to b :^.
He compares keyboards to cars
implying its not an appropriate analogy.You use both, every day, for multiple hours. All models are designed to do essentially the same job motorsport aside, paying extra for quality applies to both.
Looking to buy a TVI was wondering what you guys recommend and what I should be looking out for when purchasing?I don't want any app bullshit just a good 1080p TV
, 
/g/, I've got a friend who bitches at me for having an Nvidia card in my PC instead of AMD. He thinks they're 100% better, and I want to prove him wrong, but I don't know jack shit about this stuff. What are /g/'s opinions?
sometimes i like i try to pee in my mouth when no one is looking
Fight him, dumbass
brand loyaltyBoth of you should just kill yourselves.
This
are you Australian?
amd is for cheap faggots. enjoy your rebrandx cards anon
and I want to prove him wrongYou can't :^
youre both wrong
depends on the price point.
This, smash his face and he will stfu
I want to prove him wrongWhy  try and prove him wrong if you know nothing about it? Can't you just be a friend and say like "Listen man I know you have your preference and I'll take your word for it when I buy my next card but this current one is doing me fine thanks"? Why do friends have to try and fight each other all the time and go out of their way to prove them wrong?It's like, even if your friend was a Doctor and said "don't stab yourself in the gut with a knife or you could die", you'd go "FUCK YOU I BET YOU'RE WRONG" and stab yourself, then lay in hospital half dead and as he comes to visit you in bed you'll give him the finger with your half baked eyes and pale face and say "I was right fuckhead"
don't know jack shitwant to be rightholy fuck, just accept it when people who know more tell you something you retard
Amd beats nvidia at every price point. Inb4 gameworks optimised games.You should only go nvidia if you want a titan x, and even then, it loses to the cheaper, power hungry 295x2.
Well since you are a child, OP, maybe you should have gotten an AMD card.
Nvidia is your only option for Linux
3x and 4x TitanX SLI has no competitionhurry up with Fury, AMD
maybe you should use a real OS then
The hbm high end card is gonna btfo everything, including the 980ti.

how does a pc know how much a second is
Well first you need to make sure you have a clock mounted on your wall that's able to be easily seen by your computer.From there your computer will look at the clock and display the time to you in real time.
By converting from microwave time, of course.
It measures how long OP takes to cum to tranny porn and divides by three.
Electronic Oscillator
It uses steroided version of pic related.
how do you know?
have you never seen a quartz?
the internet sends a file to your computer every second telling it that one second has passed

implying you know how much a second is
Reddit
It posts on 4chan once every minute and uses the timer
underrated post
If you send electricity through a quartz crystal it osicillates at a known frequency
Unrelated but I didn't know that a second was something actually measured in real life. It's apparently the duration of9192631770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the twohyperfine levelsof theground stateof the caesium 133 atom before.
internetWhat if you have a computer going that you never connect to the internet?
thats why they invented wifi, so it can download the time file wirelessly
yes but thats not what the pc does.
if you put a resistor and a capacitor together then you get oscillations occurring in the output signal. If you detect the peaks of those oscillations then walla, you have some consistently spaced apart physical phenomena that you can observe
did it ever occur to you that they just found something in real life that can match very closely what the mathematical definition of a second is?
This.  IIRC the real definition of the meter and the second are relative to the speed of light in a vacuum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvpbW7JRu0Q
This is only true under a very certain range of real world conditions and the components have to last forever this way.Generating A/C with RLC circuits isn't how a computer does it, but nice try.

nah brah, I'm right. Just google search arduino RC oscillator. Doesn't even require an inductor as you claim
Only meter is defined by the amount of meters light covers in one second by 300 million. Second is the cesium one.
That's pretty good,
Niceme.me
It uses the RTC
taste it like moneyfucking creepy ass brits
nah brah, you need a crystal at least as the master for something as precise as a computer clock
wallaThankyou Professor Aboriginal.


a crystal is more precise yes, but many applications don't require a precision to the 1000th decimal place. The RC oscillator functions completely independently of a crystal. MCU's such as atmegas do not have internal crystals but instead rely on internal RC oscillators to keep time.

WA LA!only people who browse /ck/ will get this
It doesn't know. It just tells you.
i like how OP asks a serious question and nobody can answer it seriouslyfuck you /g/
and then one takes it far too seriously but still doesn't answer it.
then one responds to the too serious post without answering it either
A small piece of quartz that oscillates at a specific frequency when a fixed current is passing through it
I'll answer it seriouslyyour motherboard comes preinstalled with a set date, a battery and a meter that measures the passing of time by measuring quartz vibrations when you send current through it at least when pc is off, obviously it can easily be done through concurrent software programmingthis means that the PC doesn't know the actual date until either you or a server gives it to it, but once you got it, the pc will knowif you run out of that battery then your PC will stop being able to measure time when shut down, and you'll have to replace it
so what exactly happened during the 2000 switch?
There was a bunch of programs that didnt allocate enough space to store a time where the year was greater than 1999People thought the world was gonna break because of this
computers simply needed to update their systems to handle dates above 2000it's really not hard to understand
No, the PC uses the oscillation of a quartz crystal.
so it takes light 1 second to pass through 1 meter?amazing
wait people browse /ck/?
huerp derp its not hard to understandlook at this fuckin know it all over herewho the FUCK are YOU?

How do clocks know how much a second is?
Transistors and shit.
Uses the vibration of quartz or some shit, probably
fuckin' magnetshow do they work
it's based on the heartbeat
Quartz crystal oscillator like almost all clocks in the modern world. If computer is connected to the Internet, it checks the time occasionally from atomic time. I did a test on my Samsung tablet where I disabled the auto sync of the internal clock over the Internet. It was gaining about 25 seconds every month. It's pretty meh result but there are a number of things that can throw the time off. The fact that it had such a steady gain is bad tho.
There's tiny little men in there that work their magic.That's what me mother always told me.
if they had done nothing at all, a lot of bad shit would have gone downwhen you do something right, nobody notices
Arduino/atmel/PIC is not a PC like OP asked bout :^ 
I'm not a grammar nazi and even I laughed at 'walla', it's ridiculous, especially paired with the 'consistent observable physical phenomena' theory, just because you have a consistently based time keeping method doesn't mean you can relate it to real life time without some external inputsay my cat meows at 7pm for food every day, so I'd know the value of 24 hours, how would I know 1 hour without being aware that there are 24 hours in a daywalla is ridiculous anyway and deserves to be laughed at, reminds me of a reddit version of "OMG I literally just died watching u do that, xD"

I couldn't understand what she was saying then.  I thought she was saying who the line was named after.According to Wikipedia, the line was established by Sir George Airy.The citation is on the same Wikipedia page though, which leaves me wondering.
yeah man but most early firmware-run machines weren't made with updates in mind, so it wasn't possible to update the compiled machine code.
Apple Pay is now finished.
Android and Apple pay will be like the new Visa and Mastercard
Except you still need a credit card?They're just middlemen.
Apple should've invented Pay first.#WREKD
What an original name for fuck sakeSamsung PayGoogle Payall after Apple Pay, surely just a coincidence right?
You're just mad that Android did it first, applefag ; Apple: We have always been shameless about stealing great ideas
Apple Pay is now finished.Apple literally gets a portion of every transaction since Google licensed Apple's tokenization tech.Also, you forgot that people with money aka. white people already use Apple Pay.It's only poor niggers & spics who use Android. White people don't use android.So this discussion is fucking irrelevant.
It was already dead when fucking nowhere actually took it.go to McDonalds, they don't take itgo to Subway, they don't take itgo to Best Buy, they don't take itgo to fucking Target, they don't take itIt was dead when none of their "partners" actually lived up to their promise.
Only poor people go to mcdicks, subway, best buy and target.Only poor people buy android.
My point was, these were retailers who were part of the initial announcement of apple pay, but don't actually fucking take it.
What reason did they have to take it?It's already hard enough to find a retailer that accepts NFC payments of any form, much less a system that only works on iphone.
You have to give them some time to implement new payment systems.
i have literally only ever seen women and minorities use apple products
Only poor people buy appleFixed it for you! :^
these were retailers who were part of the initial announcement of apple payIt's been almost a year.
Statistics and facts don't agree with you. You seeing a couple of poor niggers with iPhones that probably stole them doesn't change that.
Poor people blow all their money on status symbols all the time, that doesn't make them rich.The fact of the matter is, no rich and well to do people buy android phones.
that probably stole themYou can't use a stolen iPhone.The only use for a stolen iPhone is to fix other iPhones with the parts salvaged.

So iOS is better because people who're generally more wealthy use it?Congrats, you've figured out consumerism you retarded faggot.Apple tends to market themselves as luxurious, and I must admit that iPhones are very good products just not at their pricepoint, maybe for 400-500 eurosThat's like showing a map of where Jaguar drivers live, and then tell people that Jaguars are better because rich people use themwhile they tend to break often, and parts are expensive, they're usually not that fast either.Your argument is literally "It's more expensive so it's better."

I'm in need of a cheap smartphone for basic social, getting a playlist or two for gym and normal IM. I was looking into lumia 435 what are some other cheap alternatives for a new phone?
how good are the moto e, lumia 520, bb q5 or the alcatel fire which runs firefox os?
Redmi 1s
Lumia 521 is super cheap and so is the Lumia 635, especially now with the release of the Lumia 640 soon - which will probably be around 99 bucks in walmart which is cheap too compared to other phones with the same specs.
How cheap?Just got the Asus zenfone 2 for $199Nicer spec version is $299Both on amazon with next day shipping
I'm going to buy a lumia 630 for my gf. 79 euro. so it should be around 80 bucks I guess
Or the shiny new redmi 2 2GB if you want.Or maybe a P3000S 3GB.
Don't look past the fire phone man, it is just as basic as that lumia and comes with a year of prime, and it has better specs.
g gym
Lumia 532.Quad core vs Dual core, little bit better camera, only 10€ difference.
Windows Phone really is the way to go for an affordable, basic and functional phone. It has everything social well integrated in the OS itself without even needing any extra app, music is fine, and IM too. And they all have absurdly good battery life.Just be careful about those really cheap Lumias. They're actually really good, and as sturdy as any other Nokia, but they cheaped out on the screens a bit, some of which have bad viewing angles.
mfw people are unironically suggesting windows phones
Are you an amerifat? You can get a prepaid Lumia 635 for less and they are better. Unlock codes are a few bucks on ebay.
Windows Phone really is the way to go for an affordable, basic and functional phone. It has everything social well integrated in the OS itself without even needing any extra app, music is fine, and IM too.That was true for win 7 and 8. But sine 8.1 MS has been shifting all the nice things, that were integrated in the os, away and making them as separated app. Due to quicker and easier updating proces.

I'm hijacking this thread.My Lumia 920's battery is starting to show signs of trouble, nothing too concerning, but its clear that it's entering a point where it's starting to become unreliable. I'm looking for a phone of similar build quality. I ordered a Z3C but it was cancelled since Sony had none left, I've been looking at the LG G2 and 's suggestions. Any advice? I'm looking for a phone that has enough hardware to play MKVs with no problem, a battery life at least as good as the Lumia 920's, a size somewhere inbetween the iPhone 4S and the Lumia 920, and preferably expandable storage but not necessary. The build quality not breaking after being dropped is definitely the most important thing though.
Lumia 640 is one of the best bang for the buck phones you can get right now.Unless you're really desperate to get da 200 raddest new flashlight pro DX apps on the google play store, then you'll have to get an Android phone.
Best power supplies? I know /g/ used to be all over corsair 5 years ago but now everyone hates them.
Corsair is actually still pretty good. But your best bet is either a Seasonic or Superflower PSU. Both are about equally as good. It's also no coincidence that Seasonic actually manufactures a lot of Corsair PSUs as well.And I'm not entirely too sure, but I've heard great things about EVGA's PSUs.
Corsair was loved because they were made by seasonic.Corsair is not made by seasonic anymore.No more love.
It's also no coincidence that Seasonic actually manufactures a lot of Corsair PSUs as well.They made the plain black Corsairs before there were different series, then they made the TX and RM series.Then they discontinued the RX and changed the RM to a different manufacturer. They did this right when they made the CM and CX series.So yeah, NO corsair is seasonic made right now.
Corsair still has some higher end models made by Seasonic, but they're never at a low enough price to recommend over other models from other companies that are also Seasonic/Super Flower rebadged units.

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151111My current PSU.The only thing I dislike about it is the flat cables, but that's personal preference and really has nothing to do with anything.
Wait what's wrong with Corsair? I have the AX1200 and it's a beast.
Nothing is wrong with them as long as you don't expect quality from their cheap offerings.
EVGA shitCorsair shitRosewill below average but better than above brandsBFG when they existed okayThermaltake okayUltra when they had LSP Lifetime warranty series greatOCZ specific models greatSparkle greatSeasonic excellent!
Sparkle doesn't even sell PSUs anymore.
I've only ever used Antec power supplies and have literally never lost one since the windows 95 days.
Well that is unfortunate, thanks for the updateI haven't ordered one since 2012/2013For the most part building office computers, Thermaltake/UltraBuilding "gaming mlgz computers" go with OCZ/Seasonic Seasonic is always highest recommended but their price is the only negative. Although buying 1 power supply is better than buying a new EVGA/Corsair right after it fails out of warranty constantly
Meant to include Antec under okay rating, definitely not shit tier and better than Rosewill as long as you doing buy the cheapest Antec
SeaSanicAlso I love Antec PSU's.
antec, corsair, evga, xfx are all good.
as long as you doing buy the cheapest Anteci bought a dozen antec 350w which is the cheapest one the sell and none of them went bad over 4 yearsso yeah you are full of shit
OCZ is out of the psu market as well
go to jonnyguru.com and read some reviews.Seasonic master race tho.
What's wrong with EVGA? I didn't get an EVGA psu but I was about to.

Man, you are absolutely clueless. You have no idea about PSU OEMs and just look at the brand on the box like a dumb fuck. All that fucking text to shit out terrible advice based on nothing except your like or dislike for brands.
Probably why they went out of business in the PSU market :^

It's opinion not factI have only field experience not retarded brand plugging reviews that I get paid for, I am not paid to tell you EVGA is shit; rather trying to prevent you from wasting money that could be spent more efficientlyI'm arguing with brick walls about EVGA and Corsair I know, the circlejerk on pcfag/pcgamer/reddit/bestbuy/jonnyguru/etc is too muchPretty ironic that this tool claims misinformation but literally posts biased shitI hate to tell you ladyboys that believe this shit source, but there is nothing in life absolutely nothing that is without flaw. "The Good:    everythingThe Bad:    nothingThe Mediocre:    nothing"not biased lel
JG is literally the most respected PSU review site on the net. No matter how much you kick and scream, that's a fact. I hope nobody here is fooled by your blind arrogance and bullshit, because you're 100% clueless on this subject. A worthless, meme-spouting jackass. I wish you had a trip so I could filter you.
Why would you have an issue with a graphics card?I have graphics cards that are over 10 years old and work flawlessly and they are made by Creative Technology ltd.I really don't get what kind of "issues" people expect to have with graphics cards. I've had a shit PSU arc weld a graphics card before, but that has nothing to do with the card itself.
muh redditmuh jonnygurumuh newegg reviewsField experience/personal opinions = clueless
I have not bought any high wattage psu's in the past 2 yearsFuck off, idiot.
Coil whine, overheating, broken fans...All kinds of shit.Or so I've heard.
Antec bro.Earthwatts 550 here running since 2010, replaced a 350 from 2001 that was repurposed into a htpc still running.
I probably sound like an opinionated asshole I agree, when the world is full of people that review shit they have owned for 10minutes and first time purchase, I do not take their opinion/review seriouslyJust like /k/ has a lot of nogunsJust like /out/ has a lot of indoor people/g/ has lots of technologically challenged peopleI'm not offering the advice to them, they will defend EVGA/Corsair with their life because they saw a review on youtube/reddit/newegg and take everything verbatim like its wrote in stone
What do you consider high wattage?850watt and under is not high wattageIf you are buying 850watt + every 2-3 years you are buying the wrong psu's
It's opinion not factWhat the fuck? Did you actually read any of the reviews posted? They test each PSU extensively. There's no "opinion" in ripple and efficiency numbers. You sound like the kind of delusional weirdo who talks about chemtrails.
EVGA is seasonic OEM. Some Corsairs are also Seasonic OEM.
Is etasis still around??
But you're just shooting down recommendations without learning first why those recommendations were made. You're just assuming that they're people you don't like.
Coil whine is bullshit. It happens to any electronics with coils and it's most likely the PSU that will coil whine with specific graphics card attached, since a graphics card has no coils. Defective products aren't an issue, anything can be defective at arrival. Even high quality products if you're unlucky.... And I've never heard of overheating. Unless a high powered card is placed in a case with inadequate ventilation. EVGA from what I know has noisy as fuck cooling and that's about the only thing that can go wrong with a graphics card. You could buy it and find out it's noisy as fuck.5 out of 33 EVGA PSUs both past and present are SeaSonic. I wouldn't say "EVGA is Seasonic OEM".Supernova GS is seasonic.
G-series is good.  Only real drawback is no modular.Are you talking about this Ultra?http://mail.ultraproducts.com/reviews.phpI'd take any Seasonic model before I went with Ultra...EVGA has one of the best RMA departments of any PC hardware company.  I don't know why you're hating on them.Corsair makes some of the best enthusiast PC cases on the market.The Asus Sabertooth motherboards you're mocking are some of the best boards on the market.  I don't know of any other board with a 5 year mfr warranty.Kingston has the best quality control of any of the common desktop memory brands, and their failure rates reflect that.
I pretty much built every computer that you didn't build in the whole world. I know a thing or two. Trust me, I wouldn't post on this site if I didn't know everything in the world. I'm from the internet for crying out loud.
This guy built my PC. You can trust him.
a graphics card has no coils.Good joke.
It doesn't.
Elpidia
I don't think you even know what a coil is.  Do some research before you embarrass yourself further.
If we're posting field experience, I used to pop psu's from all brands like a house wife pops oxys shitty power im my area until I started buying seasonic PSUs mostly the corsair rebrands, got an evga badged superflower im gonna swap in to my main machine when I overhaul it too.As for the retards complaining about oversized supplies, when a psu is at half load it tends to run closer to its peak efficiency and wastes less power as heat.In saying that you don't need an 1800w PSU to run a gtx 980 and an i3 at stock either
This guy knows.  I use dynex psus in all mission critical builds. You should too.
I know exactly what a coil is. Point me to those coils on a graphics card.
Do you only buy gfx cards with passive heatsinks?
I think midrange and high-end XFX power supplies are made by Seasonic and slightly cheaper than comparable Seasonic-branded ones.
Let me google that for you.http://lmgtfy.com/?q=graphics+card+coils+pictures
a graphics card has no coilsI know nobody in their right mind is using a GT 740 but yes, GPUs have coils. Google '970 coil whine'.
That is a card with minimal coils.  High end cards have a ton.
I know, I'm just stating that cards DO have coils.
Asus motherboards are great, I was not mocking the model as much as the idea to spend on the most expensive parts available that are labeled for gamers. If you do not spend on the most expensive "gamer parts" you have a shit computerBasic workstation chipsets are beyond sufficient to run most hardware intense games available, most cannot utilize all the frills of "gamer hardware"Ultra used to be decent only with their LSP model power supplies and only those Lifetime warranty on a power supply, used to allow multiple RMA's now it is just 1 time for those models and back to 1-3year warranty  Ultra is definitely no where near Seasonic qualityI won't touch EVGA or Corsair, I am in the minority and am okay with thatCrucial over Kingston, experience over the past decade+ of residential clients buying Kingston memory sticks from local retail stores only to have them fail; it could simply be they bought the value/cheap models but I have bought maybe 300-400 memory sticks from Crucial in the past 6 years and maybe 2-3 were defective 2 of them were DOA, 2x2gb package
Coil whine happens and it's annoying as hell. The PSU is what whines as a result of being hooked up to a certain card, yes. But since the PSU can operate without whine with a different card, I blame it on the card.Defective products are absolutely an issue.Anything can be broken on arrival, yeah,but when I said broken fans, I meant they break off later, once the card has been in use for a while. I remember reading about some MSI cards that had that issue a while back.Good point on the overheating.EVGA cooling is pretty loud from like 80% on.I just tweak the fan settings and it works out.Don't really game that much any more, though.
Those parts you just pointed out aren't used on graphics cards unless you're buying some bottom of the barrel trash. Those are iron chokes.Ferrite chokes aren't going to make noise.
S E A S O N I CEASONIC
Seems unanimous, not sure why people are still posting other brands
Here you go. All graphics cards will have coils as part of their power delivery circuits. but why does it say R22, anon? Good question. Inductor labeling is a bit weird, but "R22" means 0.22μH. The number is usually in μH, and R is a stand-in for a decimal point.
 fuck, forgot pic
Those are ferrite chokes. I'll be fucking surprised if those make noise considering the way they are constructed.
Again, do your research.  I've had my techs swap out cards that were whining with another of the exact same make and model and fixed the problem.  If you look on the NVIDIA forums you'll see many many reports of GTX 970 coil whine.
I'll be fucking surprised if those make noise considering the way they are constructed.http://wccftech.com/nvidia-gtx-970-coil-whine/
Why the fuck not? They're still coils.
That is the most retarded anecdotal shit I've ever heard. That could just as well be the power supply that is whining because of some resonance issue with that specific card.I doubt these people used anything other than their ears to determine the location of the coil whine, and it's almost impossible to tell where it's coming from.
So basically you don't know shit about shit?
If everything else is the same and swapping the card cures the problem, that's not enough to satisfy you?How about quotes from the device manufacturers?From MSI:“The coil whine issue is not specific to 900 series, but can happen with any high end GPU and that MSI is looking in to ways to minimize the issue. If you still have concern regarding this issue, then please contact our RMA department.”From EVGA:“We have been watching the early feedback on GTX 970 and inductor noise very closely, and have actively taken steps to improve this. We urge anyone who has this type of concern to contact our support so we can address it directly.”Read more: http://wccftech.com/nvidia-gtx-970-coil-whine/#ixzz3bVH9UPW4

Apperantly new Seasonics' have shit load of coil whine because of their new power efficiency circuit or something
A lot of misinformation in this thread. I thought you were better than that, /g/.Good OEMs: Super Flower DeltaSeasonicFlextronicsBrands worth considering:Antec - HCG series and some others are good Seasonic, HCP series Delta OEM are top tier.Chieftec - varies. Their Delta stuff is good.Cooler Master - has a million OEMs. Mostly crap, but they have some solid units eg. V seriesCorsair - has a million OEMs. They sell a lot of shit PSUs, but AX and HXi are good, AXi are top tier.Enermax - have some excellent stuff and some crap stuff. Look up reviewsEVGA - their G2 series Super Flower is excellent, P2 has a weird ripple bug but otherwise good. Avoid the restNZXT - has some Seasonic / Super Flower units, avoid the restRosewill - has some Super Flower units Hive, Capstone, avoid the restSeasonic - is Seasonic. Avoid their XP series, coil whine and fan control problems. Everything else is fine.SilverStone - has a million OEMs. Makes the best SFX PSUs. Varies from decent to very goodSuper Flower - is Super Flower. Regardless of brand, you should always look up reviews for every model, especially if that brand has a lot of OEMs. No brand is perfect. For reviews: http://www.jonnyguru.com/PSU OEM list: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/power-supply-psu-brands,3762.htmlAlso, graphics cards do have coils and they do have coil whine. I don't know why this is even a point of contention.
HCP may be good, but it seems to me they're louder than most of the other premium units.
That's Delta for you!
Good OEMs:How is CWT?
Enermax - have some excellent stuff and some crap stuff. Look up reviewsAll Enermax is good, but NAXN isn't. That's made by CWT. The NAXN has the enermax brand attached, but it's not made by enermax.
CWT are the people behind the Corsair CX series among many others. Ranges from crap to decent.  Yeah, that's what I was referring to.
I picked up a corsair H1050  to power two 290x. How did I do? It replaced my ancient antec cp-850.
CP-850 was great.  Too bad it was huge.  I still have one hanging around somewhere in a box.
Is that the modular one with the external fan? Fucking baller
Yeah.  Antec fucked up when they discontinued all the cases that fit it.
people actually buying premium PSUsL O L fucking cuckstfw $45 "Widetech" power supplyhad it for four yearsruns perfectlyincredibly quietI bet you own apple devices too.
 My recollection from research last month Antec PSU died is that the Corsair CS series is good, and the CX series sucks.I bought a Seasonic modular.  The modular bit seems really shitty to me.  The wires seem thin and inflexible compared to EVERY past PSU I've ever had.My last PSU was an Antec, built by Delta.  There was a deal on Slickdeals the other day for a Seasonic-built Antec for $50 after rebate.I've had Antec PSUs for probably eight years now.  They always die after about three years, which happens to be the warranty period.  My last Delta-built Antec died two weeks and one day after the warranty expired.Check out Jonnyguru.com for in-depth PSU reviews.  That site saved me a ton of time.
do tell
Widetech makes premium PSUs. Or well, Widetech doesn't do shit. They just rebrand Great Wall Energy co., ltd.
Just go to your local asian weekend computer market and buy the cheapest PSU in the wattage you want. Buying a name-brand PSU is like spending $200 on a single power outlet fitting "in case there's a surge". It's just conspicuous consumption. If you actually care about your electronics just get fucking surge insurance.I doubt the $40 750w model was 'premium'.
$45 "Widetech" power supplyWhat hardware is it powering? Just about anything could power a very low-power machine.Some of us would rather not have power supplies that could blow up and take $1000+ of hardware with it. I'm glad you've been lucky, but not all of us like to gamble.
implying the only way a PSU can fail is a surge
i5 2500k7970ghzMatx mobo2x SSD2x7200rpm SATA HDDAny power supply can blow up, anon, and there is a dearth of evidence on the topic. Enjoy your snake oil though, bet it doesn't even have multicolored LEDs.
The 750W model was probably either a very old design or it was simply lowered in price as part of a sale. You can't get a 750W PSU for 40 dollars because the components used to build a 750W PSU normally cost more than 40 dollars.I don't think widetech does fake wattage, but the third option if it wasn't on sale would be that the PSU has a fake wattage and it's actually somewhere around 500W
A shit.
Terrible advice, disregard.
You can get a solid value-oriented 750W unit 750 B2 for $80. For me, $125 for a power supply that's silent, reliable, fully modular, and has great performance EVGA 750 G2 is a no-brainer. Any power supply can blow upNo shit, but a good power supply is much less likely to blow up, especially if it's made by an OEM who specialises in enterprise-grade products that are designed to not fail. Some random chink company isn't going to be fun to chase down for a return claim, either.a dearth of evidence You know that "dearth" means "a lack of", right? What are you trying to say here?
What are you trying to say here?That the only people telling you that premium PSUs blow up less often are the people selling them to you.
It's definitely true.  Another thing to consider is efficiency - over it's lifespan a more efficient power supply can easily pay for itself in power costs.  Look at Jonny Guru's tests with off-brand units.  They're often rated for more power than they're able to deliver and they will literally catch fire.
If there's such a lack of evidence about it, how the fuck do you know? Are you some kind of PSU failure psychic?
makes a claim concerning a topicimmediately after that, says there's no evidence on said topicthe fuck?
Power supply "blowing up" is the least severe problem that can arise from power supply.Yesterday I swapped the graphics card in my dads computer and I got serious artifacting on it. Wanna guess what caused it? It was the power supply which was working "perfectly". My dad is lucky I'm good at computer diagnosis, because his hardware could end up dead if I didn't replace that PSU.PSU worked "fine" with another GPU btw.
a random $45 chink PSU is just as reliable as one by a respected server PSU manufacturer you know that these companies delta, super flower etc live or die on their PSU reliability, right? if the servers of their enterprise customers fail more than extremely rarely, they're in deep shit. some random chink company has no accountability and thus doesn't give a shit about QC, using quality components or meeting spec, just ship something that vaguely works saying "but my chink PSU just werked" is logic equivalent to "my grandma smoked a pack a day and lived to 90, therefore smoking is safe"
 Got an evga 550w nonmodular don't have the exact model in front of me right now back in November and it's terriffic.
asking /g/ about PSUsYou couldn't have picked a worse place.
I was thinking of buying a Cooler Master PSU. Is Cooler Master a good brand or should I pick a different PSU?
tfw I've been running a CX500M for two years at near max load. Read the reviews and make your decision that way. /g/ isn't known for the complete truth. Just edgy opinions.
Yeah It was an amazing PSU but really massive and it finally failed me when I got a 8GB 290X but to be fair it has serviced me through 2 previous computers and I couldn't really ask for more.
CX500M should last at least 3 years minimum before the caps start to fail in normal operation.A PSU that develops problems within 2 years would be defective or defective by design.
you know that these companies delta, super flower etc live or die on their PSU reliability, right?No, they live or die on people giving them their money or not.  As a friend of mine in the computer industry once said, "You don't need a product.  You just need paying customers."
read the reviewsYes please do, especially the ones pointing out that the CX series Corsairs use chinese capacitors.
Currently using an HEC 400W 80+ HEC-400TE-2WXI also have a D.High 400W 80+ Bronze  pic related. This one is super heavy, but it's a brand I've never heard of.I also have a Seventeam 500W ST500-BKV, which I don't think is 80+Should I switch to one of my other PSUs?
No. Buy a modern PSU when that shit is over 3 years old.

Seasonic, Corsair, Enermax.
AX760 is manufactured by Seasonic you dipshit.
any seasonic or evga are top quality every other brand has bad and good models depending on the OEM

Go for an R9 290X instead. Better performance for the same price or cheaper depending on the manufacturer. Also you don't need that many fans, but if your case allows it, why not. Everything else seems fine.
The fans maybe seem an overkill but I like the color scheme and I have 1 installed right now its silent but effectiveFirst I´m gonna buy the cpu+mobo and in like 3 months gonna buy the gpu, the 290X seem a good option But when its supossed to arrive the 300 series? Or the new Nvidia Lineup?
Hey /g/ which budget build is betterAMDhttp://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/yQkHZLINTELhttp://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/Q7tLLkLeave feedback for amd or intel for improvements
bump
The 300 series should come out some time this year. You could wait until it launches and then get a 290X because the prices will drop or just buy one of the 300 series cards. It'll probably be expensive though. I don't think Nividia is planning on releasing a new series any time soon, although it's likely that they'll release a 980 Ti to compete with AMD. That'll probably be pricey as well though.
http://pcpartpicker.com/p/6zpQvKi would recommend a 290x and to invest a little more into your CPU i recommend i5 4690K , it goes for around $208 bucks and is well worth the investment

I bought 5 blank cdz today to create some audio discs for my dad, verbatim CD-R 80 min discs.So far I fucked up 4 discs and not a single one is working I tried burning them on ganno and on windows. On linux with cdrdao in terminal, it reports SCSI command failed: sense key: 0x03: Medium Error shortly after the burning process begins.Xfburn burned the whole thing at super slow speed, ejected the disc, inserted the disc, still looked blank.On Wangblows:I burned the same files using wmp, similar result to Xfburn, burned  ejected  inserted disc appears blankLast try with wmp yielded this messageError burning a CD - Windows Media Player cannot burn the files. If the burner is busy, wait for the current task to finish. If necessary, verify that the burner is connected properly and that you have installed the latest device driver.Are the discs shit-tier or is my cd writer kill
I have alot of discs around, mostly old games, so the drive will see some use. Also my internet is fucking terrible, so buying physicals of some larger stuff will be a thing.Could you recommend a good case? I probably didn't look around half as much as I could have, but people jerk off over the R4 pretty hard, so I figured it was worth the dough.I appreciate the motherboard, but is the gpu alright? Generally I see people say that when you get AMD, you go sapphire or go home. Also newegg is selling the vapor-x 280x for $200, figured I might pick that one up instead.
Yeah if you can grab the vapor x for 200 def go for itIf you want the extra horsepower the asus 290x is the cheapest at expense of some cooling
Oh, didn't see the newer thread.How do I get off of Linux training wheels? The least babby-mode distro I've ever really used is Debian and I'd like to get to know the command line better. I've tried installing Arch several times and my neckbeard is clearly not up to the task yet. Which distro should I go to from here?
keep trying arch
stay on debian, learning the command line has nothing to do with the distro and learning the command line has nothing to do with arch.Arch is installed using a set of commands that even the most neckbearded guru has to go through it from the wiki because it gets updated and changed from time to time the steps depending on the latest arch iso and changes.just try to expand the time you spend in your system by using the terminal more often to do the same stuff you do with the help of a gui, focus on the most common stuff at first and start leveling up with the help of man pages.
http://pcpartpicker.com/part/corsair-case-cc9011075wwThe GPU is fine by the way.AMD has had a history of shitty drivers for Linux. They've gotten significantly better within the last year though. You can find 750 Tis for $110ish or you can go with a R9 270 for slightly more.

I kept hearing that umatrix is a replacement for noscript, however disabling scripts in umatrix doesn't give me the page with javascript disabled like noscript does, it just causes the page to break.  For example, I can't get the captcha on 4chan working with scripts disabled, even with 4chan X set to force noscript captcha.  What gives?
the operation d / c would be 1It would be 3, not 1. d/c = 9/3 = 3Anyway, you're trying to divide by zero. If your array was limited to non-zero numbers, you could just multiply them by the same number to maintain the ratio.

If possible, do not install GAPPS, use an alternative market like f-droid or aptoide instead.  If you really can't live without it, freeze Google play services whenever you aren't using something that needs it, and keep Google's location service disabled.  Also, disable the captive portal check, it connects to Google every time you connect to a wifi network.  And change the supl host in gps.conf to something non Google.Use AFwall+ for firewall.  Use either App ops or Xprivacy to disable access to a variety of things on a per app basis.  Xprivacy has more control than app ops.Lightning browser for browser, K9 mail for email, not sure about messaging.  Just sticking to open source stuff here.As for proxies, I believe Android supports VPNs out of the box, not sure.  You could also grab orbot for tor.

Hmm, I don't know, I'm afraid of going all in to SID and then having something break on me that is. Maybe I'll try it in a VM and if I can handle SID, I will move to SID, since on IRC they told me it's a bad idea to go to a non-stable version. But I'll see what happens then.Because there were packages that I tried to get on Wheezy, and I had to do like they said to get it from SID without moving there.
All the reading about delidding and I can't figure out, do you relid the processor after? Or the heatsink goes right on the die?
So I have a dual monitor set up, and normally when the system boots up, it is in mirror mode until I start an X session, but now it will only display on one monitor when it boots up.

It'll definitely do those things.Probably a bit overpowered for those tasks though...
Ideally you want all sticks to be the same brand and model. Each stick per pair 1+3 and 2+4 must have the same size, and I believe same type DDR3/4/5. If you can't match both pair together, at least make sure that both sticks in each pair match.

Yeah when the languages are similar there's a lot less to learn.Some languages are still going to be hard to learn, but python and Java share a decent amount so you'll have a lot of the same concepts.vimtutor is a great resource.

Is it stupid to buy MacBook solely for the battery life and trackpad? The other competition is the dell xps 13 which is equally as expensive as the MacBook Air
yes, it was stickied to the top of the page
I've never done this before, but I think I can give you a place to start. You probably need to make a new entry in your bootloader with a different set of kernel boot time parameters. You can use kernel boot time parameters to pass parameters to your init system. You can probably use this to control what gets started and what doesn't. If you were using sysvinit I think you would want to boot into runlevel 3 instead of runlevel 5, but I don't know how you'd do it with systemd.
Since I know java, javascript seems really easy up until I get to all the frameworks. what is the best way to learn all the frameworks as quickly as possible
Yes. Many ultrabooks have decent enough battery life if that's your concern and trackpads are all generally terrible :^No. If you are really that worried use a VPN. Peerblock is almost a placebo now

Disable IPv6 from your connection settings if you wanna be safe with Peerblock, because it supports only IPv4 afaik. I use it to block ads, tracking, leechers, bots, crawlers, known malware servers, botnets and MAFIAA trolls. Of course, you've to rely on the IP lists and need to update them on daily basis, I use iBlocklist to find the lists I need.Every tool is an additional layer of security, Peerblock isn't placebo, though I wish it had better compatibility with Win7.
Best laptop for an engineering student? Most places on the internet are pointing me towards a Lenovo ThinkPad W541, is this my best option? Is this the newest/best model as of right now? Would prefer answers from engineering students/professionals.

I guess anything a thinkpad will do you good, just ask the thinkpad general thread what would they suggest to be honest.If you're going to be running programs that will require a lot of processing power, then a newer model might be a better idea, though I'm not too familiar with thinkpads:

What's the smallest solution for emulating SNES games at 60 fps? I'm going to be making a PC inside an SNES. I was going to use an Intel Atom board, then I realized I'm probably retarded, and I can use a Raspberry Pi or some other small computer.Literally all I'll be doing is emulating a SNES on Linux.
You can use a Pi 2 with RetroPi, and emulate a lot more than just SNES if you want too.
That's what I was looking at now. I'm thinking of dedicating it to SNES, because I'm autistic and I'll sperg out if a SNES build is playing games from other consoles.Thanks, anon.

I'm using custom explorer icons in windows 7 and when I have thumbnails enabled, the custom folder icons revert to the default folder icons with the little previews of the files/images inside of it coming out, like pic related. Disabling thumbnails in "adjust appearance and performance" solves that problem, but then none of my actual images show up as thumbnail previews in explorer. Is there any way to disable the "inside of folder preview" feature and still use thumbnails for actual images?

What is a mechanical keyboard?
After like an hour of googling I can't find anything related to this.When I'm playing Killing Floor 2, and only then, my mobo gives off a beep. Just one, very long beep, like 10 seconds on average, without pause.Nothing happens during this time. The game keeps running smoothly. My CPU/GPU temps are fine around 60c. When I quit out of the game, or alt-tab out, everything on my desktop, browser, etc., looks fine. Literally nothing seems wrong at all. I went into BIOS to check temperatures there, all fine. I opened my case, saw nothing out of the ordinary. I tried to find beep codes and apparently, 1 long beep just means "POST has passed all tests".I put around 80 hours into Killing Floor 2 before this started happening. I assume it isn't specific to just KF2, but I don't have any other remotely-graphically-intense games to try right now. Running some non-taxing indieshit games doesn't trigger it.Any ideas?For easy copypasting:ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC. P8H61-M LX PLUS LGA1155

I recently downloaded a bunch of new fonts for a project, and now a lot of websites are defaulting to one of the fonts I installed helvetica neue and they're all completely unreadable pic related.Wat do?
Have you tried just simply changing the Font setting in your browser's settings?
Sorry, I really should have specified that I had tried that. My browser says it defaults to Arial, but I assume that's when no font is specified on a website's CSS.
What's the best backup utility for Android?
My temporary solution is to not allow websites to choose their own fonts. It's not ideal, since I'm usually fine with people's font choices, but a lot of people use helvetica neue apparently, and it really doesn't read well in small text for me. It would be great if I could disable that single font from rendering, but whatever.

I actually just installed Witcher 3 to test, and it happens with it too. It was running like shit, but it wasn't running any worse when the beeping started. Same thing, nothing happened. Hasn't beeped again since I quit out of the game.

I played around with Batch files the other day making some simple text adventure games. But now I kinda want to try something more "powerful" yet still ridiculously simple.What language would you recommend for that?I don't expect to learn any proper programming or anything. I just want to make some really simple stuff and play around a bit. Doesn't matter if it's some antiquated language nobody uses.
Python.
thank you
Isn't python resonantly advanced for just playing around in.  Like, you have to learn proper syntax and stuff and not just look at a few commands and copy them.Like it actually takes effort I mean.
Intel 3000 Graphics vs AMD Firepro 3D?I usually look for gaming videos with each card though I don't intend to use them for any high end games, and I saw the Firepro running Battlefield 3 smoothly, and I have Intel 3000 Graphics on my Laptop, and I know I couldnt run BF3 on it.Just curious, as I'm able to get it for a steal, I've just never heard of AMD Firepro 3D before today.  The most gaming I do is playing DOOM and maybe a little CSGO, so obviously I don't need an incredible gfx card like that, but I do do some CAD and 3D modeling on occaison.
Python is one of the most simple scripting languages around.Bash could be your next go instead, but honestly, batch and bash are abominations compared to Python.
The code looks like plain english.Stuff likePrint "Enter dungeon?"choice = input"Y/N"if choice == "Y":...I haven't used it in some time so that might be exactly correct but it's easy as shit to useThough if you are making text adventure games, there's probably a dedicated program to do specifically that too

Fair enough. Maybe I'll take my time out to learn a bit.It doesn't need any special sort of "compiling" or anything?I can basically just run the py file so to speak and it will work?Though if you are making text adventure games, there's probably a dedicated program to do specifically that tooThe text adventure is more the byproduct. I like the scripting part more than the finished thing. But I don't want to go out of my way to properly learn something just so I can play around for a few hours.I'll look into it. Thanks.
Thanks, Anon but just wondering, how would one write it if using the logic I was before?
You for real?If you want a team of consultants to fix every single problem your thick babby mind cannot handle by itself fucking pay for it
I can basically just run the py file so to speak and it will work?Yes. All you need to do beforehand is installing Python.Before you ask what version to install, just install Python 3+,
You're asking whether to go with integrated graphics or a workstation card for mostly gaming just because you do occasional CAD?I know this is the stupid questions thread, but come on.
Alright. Thanks. Just curious. Does a py file work the same in a windows CLI as it does a Linux one?
You'd write it in a non-functional way, like you did.Your code is based on the fact that x and y are being manipulated via side effects.
Yes.python file executes the script in both cases.

Hi everyone. Here's a CSS puzzle I can't quite solve. Maybe you can help?• Pic related is the target effect. Things in black are 3 joined Arabic letters, with diacritics in red.• Diacritic characters henceforth: dia are added after a "naked" letter as separate entities.• First attempt: style the dia directly by wrapping them in class-ed tags. Result: dia show up in red, but they're floating above whitespace and break up the word into individual letters.• Next attempt: use styled ::after pseudo-class one for each dia and apply them to the individual letter. Result: word is intact but color styling isn't applied.Here's a sample cade for the latter, with a proof this usually works but doesn't in that particular case:htmlheadmeta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8"style type="text/css"p.sandrune {font-size:7em; line-height:0;}span.modal::before {color:pink; content:"should ";}span.d::after {color:red; content:"ُ";}span.f::after {color:red; content:"َ";}span.s::after {color:red; content:"ْ";}/style/headbodyh1This span class="modal"work/span…/h1p class="sandrune"span class="d"ه/spanspan class="f"ه/spanspan class="s"ه/span/p/body/htmlAny ideas?

The other day I fell asleep with my laptop Lenovo Ideapad z510 on. I woke up and it was off, and it wouldn't turn back on. I just took the whole thing apart to get the battery, took it out, unplugged it, and held the power down for 30 seconds. I plugged it in without the battery and tried to turn it on, but it didn't turn on. I put the battery back in and now the light for the battery is on, but nothing else will turn on. What do?

I guess one way would be to keep it relatable to normals.I mean. They wouldn't care if Linux has a great CLI or is good for ricing or something like that. But they might care about how installing programs can be very similar to smartphones.

One thing I've learned is that no matter how broken, no matter how disgusting they treat their users, no matter the multitude of superior alternatives. As long as the software can do somewhat do task in the end. They will pretty much never every try to find an alternative. Hiding behind excuses like "It works for me" or "I don't have time for that stuff".If you manage to get past that problem. Then you might get something out of it.

I've been using laptops for the most of 2008 and beyond.

A good messaging app I've used is TextSecure. Encrypts all your messages locally and can send encrypted messages to other text secure users.that is if anyone i knew also used it
I have two network cards in my laoptophow do I use them? just create a 'wlan2' entry in my interfaces file?does anyone have experience with this?
Would a dongle be just as good as a card do you think?  I don't think I've ever seen a desktop with a Wifi Dongle.  I guess they'd be in the back though in most cases if it connects to the ethernet, unless its USB
Wifi dongle are usually low performance low cost solutions, so if you want any kind of performance buy a good wifi card.I would not recommend using wifi for a desktop computer at all tho. It's less reliable than an ethernet connection.
Never mind it worked. I just had to put it back together
All of that javascript is client-side, right? And you probably don't want your email addy to sit in the source code for every spammer to scrape, right?1.

It still has ads and bullshit.
Wifi dongle are usually low performance low cost solutionsYeah thats what I thoughtI don't think the ethernet wiring where I stay is working I'll admit I don't fully understand how it works, I've plugged my laptop into it and my computer would say there is no ethernet cable plugged in so I figure there's an issue somewhere.Ive been using my laptop as a sort of desktop using it's wireless connectivity with no major complaints so I dont think Id have a huge issue with it in a desktop, unless the card wasn't as good as the one in my current laptop I know nothing about network cards, I usually just download the drivers and things jut 'werk'

You don't even mention your operating system, besides a slight clue that it might be GNU/Linux but nothing more specific.You can't expect to receive many helpful responses if you don't give us enough details.
can you just set up a separate sandbox for each program, with minimal extra hassle in using them?
Ah okay.  I wish all programs just used .cfg files in the appdata folder, would be much cleaner.  But that's my own problem, since I use Windows.  Ah well.
That would be a bit much to do for every program on your computer.

How do you set applet to autostart from terminal?
find the website where you bought it or somethingEven if they do, how can they tell which SKU it is and even if they dig that up, how can they know the price hasn't changed?
i think it will work if the item isn't very expensive and the price you claim seems reasonable. but they might be able to find the real price of the item with just a quick google search or maybe they'll check your credit card statement if they think you're trying to trick them so just be aware that there's some risk involved
it'll be hard to tell if the paypal receipt doesn't provide many details. but like if it turns into a police investigation because it's some expensive car part or something then they could check your bank account

they'll check your credit card statementoh shit, can they actually do that? If so, then it's no good I guess. Shouldn't my bank account history be private though?

How do I get ftp-user1 to upload files? Like I can download but I can't upload. Any help appreciated.Here is my vsftpd config:http://pastebin.com/9r4KkbFqAlso how do I configure SAMBA and MiniDLNA?

I get it.always add a border, but make it transparent.when it's selected color it red.
I need a wired mouse with a nice high DPI, fast report time, no programmable buttons and no retarded lights everywhere besides the laser. Can you guys rec one for me? My budget is around 50 dollars, I won't go over 60

I have the Intel P8Z77-V DELUXE motherboard and i5-3570K and can't upgrade to the i5-4690K because it requires LGA 1150, that sucks man, why can't they make them to where they fit a LGA 1155 so people can upgrade without have to buy a new board?
thats how intel jews you out of more money
That's hardly an upgrade, at least for that cost.
This, would be hard to justify buying a new cpu even without the new mobo.
tfw no Intel PIZZA DELUXE
that's not right
well would you rather have them not release any improvements to their CPU line for 3 years? if so then maybe you should buy AMD
why the FUCK would you bother upgrading from a 3570k to a 4670k?Holy mother of pointless upgrades, buddy fucker
This. There's no real benefit from upgrading from a 3570k.
What kind of retard are you that you want to spend more than $100 on a 2% performance increase?
tfw having a shitty 1155 mainboard and can't find anything decent anymore
AMD let you upgrade your single-core Athlon64 to a six-core Phenom without changing mainboards. Sadly they lost it with AM3, making the Bulldozers require AM3+.
Pointless upgrade. Dont do it OP
Not OP but good to hear that I don't need to upgrade my 3570k yet.I was just thinking about how fucked up this is, I'm with a P8Z77-V Pro
And that's why the poor will always remain poor.
At least there hasn't been a worthy upgrade since Sandy Bridge.My only gripe is I picked up my motherboard right before the Z68 chipsets came out.TFW P8P67 Pro and can't access integrated graphics for extra compute goodness

implying upgrading a CPU on the same platform isn't really just throwing your money awayIf you are upgrading before socket changes - either AMD or Intel - you are just wasting money on negligible performance boosts.
How do we stop normie invasion to Internet?
Nuking China would help.
Cant. Time to make a second more obscure internet. Either that or add goatse captcha.
add goatse captchaSounds like a plan.
Flee to the Dark Net, it's our only hope.
all this says is that there are more Chinese than Americans. the US is 318.9M, so 88% of the US uses the internet, while China is just over 47%
it's going to be over soon.  they will move on to their tablets, "apps" and phones
we get rid of shitty sites like reddit and 9gag that encourge normies to lurk less. also, be more hostile like back in the late 90s. back then, you never knew what to expect.
Make interacting with things require some form of effort?The moment you take away ease of access, you'll find a lot of people just don't bother trying at all. That's why Pirating has become so mainstream. Google the site, type in the name, click "get torrent" and "OK" and there's your movie.
IPv6-only networking, there is still a lot of stuff designed only with IPv4 in mind. Normies can't be bothered to either buy a new router, configure Miredo or let ISP's know what they want them to change en mass.
go back in time and kill the creators of myspace and facebook
It is too late for that anon. We have to move somewhere else. The regular internet has already been lost to normies and will only get worse with more people in third world countries getting access.

MediaTekNo
Qualcomm shill plz.
MediaKek
It still posts a composite score of 45000 on Antutu. Which is the same as the Snapdragon 801. Sure it'll get a bit hotter, but will real world performance be affected that much? All graphic intensive games tend to run smoothly.
The problem is that the energy efficiency is shit, it eats up battery like Chrome eats up RAM.
If not for that large lenovo logo, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between it and the Xaiomi's Redmi.
I suppose that's true. But should at least give around 4 hrs sot, no? Which is not worse than a nexus 4/5 minus the chinese bloat.
screw yourself over by buying a 'flagship' chinkphone with pre-installed bloat and buggy ROM that won't get any updates
flagshipIt's marketed as a mid ranger for $150. No updatesIt has Lollipop out of the box which is crap but that's a completely different debate something that a majority of mid rangers don't have.Buggy rom[citation needed]Try harder.
It gets fucking destroyed by ASUS ZenFone 2.
The Zenfone 2 costs more.
destroyedHow so? This is about half the price of the zenfone 2.
Because it'll probably fall apart after a few months as most of the Lenovo phones do. I won't be buying another one from them anytime soon.
which one did you have?
seriously, are "Octa-core" chips even matter? Will it only add more heat and battery hog?
Yes.  This one is even worse because MediaTek uses a 28nm process for the MT6752 which is two nodes behind Samsung and Intel.  It would technically be on par with the Qualcomm 801 except that MediaTek isn't Qualcomm so you get less performance per watt.Lenovo like most of Red China builds throwaway trash.  I would skip this.

Bash lenovogo full shill for OPO chink shit/g/ in a nutshell
LTE is a subset of 4G
Need some salve for that butthurt, OP?Sure, $150 for a Chinese midrange that's good for maybe a year is okay.  I'm sorry that /g/ didn't elect you shill for the day for your find.  Does that help with the anus inflammation?
i wonder who is behind this
hspa+ is not 4gquit falling for the marketing bullshit
But it doesnt say LTE it justvsays 4g
found the OPO fanboy Good good. Let the butthurt flow.
seeIf it supports 4G, it supports LTE
would love to see a picture of that 13 mpx " "camera" "very mpxsuch big, wow
Tell that to the LG optimus L70
This tooTo be fair, most low end chinkphones look the same these days.
Looks okay-ish for the pricegizmochina.com/2015/05/25/lenovo-k3-note-review-almost-great-budget-smartphone/
And what is the price with warranty from a reliable national seller?
bashes a shitty chink phone for being shitty and chinesemust be a fanboy of another shitty chinkphone, also shitty and chineseOneplus a shit, lenovo a shit.
I didn't shill either you retard. I only pointed out the hypocrisy.Oneplus a shit, lenovo a shit.lrn 2 english
The LG optimus L70 doesn't have 4G support at all. It has HSPA+, which it shows the "4G" icon while connected to because it's "4G-like speeds" but it's still a 3G standard.
 "4G-like speeds"correct me if i'm wrong but, isn't HSPA+ speed dependent on the carrier?
the 2gb ram version of the zenfone 2 is $199
What? I'm not calling you a shill, just pointing out how flawed your logic is. Here's an analogy to help:I don't like mcdonalds because I don't like burgers or friesBURGER KING FANBOY DETECTED tip: /g/ is not a single person, and can be filled with shills at any time. Oneplus gained alot of publicity due to the invite system, who knows if they actually shilled here though. People know they're shit now anyway, no one would recommend OPO as a new phone in 2015.alsolrn2 englishlurk more
The speed of every standard is dependent on the carrier. HSPA+ allows for speeds in the range usually covered by 4G standards, and thus is often displayed as 4G so as not to confuse users who think that little number before the G at the top of their screen correlates directly to speed.
what happened with that one chinkphone that had like a 5.5k mah battery blue something?
4g LTEGet out of here you filthy american
Just to be absolute here for people confused by carrier marketing of 4g, it does in fact support LTE, though I do not know what bands.Typically mediateks modems aren't as comprehensive in their frequency support, so check what bands your carrier uses and cross with the supported ones.
Oops
Oh well I'm silly, it tells you right here.
though I do not know what bandsdid you seriously not click the expand button? jeez bruh.
And may as well post a comparison with say, a Qualcomm modem powered phoneThis is one of the reasons Qualcomm is the goddamn king in mobile, even Samsung licensed some modem stuff from them in the s6 exynos chip I think
pre-infected with Superfish
It only supports TDD-LTE it won't work in the US.
No band 2, 4, or 12T-Mo brethren should avoid this phone.

You're a shitter, there isn't  a program to hack into a password protected thing like that bruteforce doesn't count bakas the hacker way would be to either find an error in their validation algo for the password or to dump the db containing the hash and hashcat it.
fuck off. sage.
How can i bruteforce it? I know its usually supereffective
I know its usually supereffectivesure.
Bumper
Go root through the trash of the testing place.Social Engineering best Engineering.
Bump
You're on /g/. No one will ever show you their power level.
Basically this
Bruteforcing is only supereffective if you know about certain things, like the length of the password or what characters it would use.For example: some Netgear routers use a default password for their WPA2 encrypted wifi. This password is always 8 characters long and will only contain numbers. Bruteforcing that will not take long, but guess what would happen if you didn't know one or both of the details. You'd start at alpha-numerical + special char passwords with one character and slowly work your way upwards until you hit the goal.Now imagine that password to be 32 characters long.Bruteforce is the least elegant and most time consuming way to get a password.

Nice try.They would never do this, it's suicide.
The $1500 includes the price of a gaymen computer.Nice bait.Oculus is still trash though.
They said a good gaming PC PLUS the oculus would cost $1500.Nice reading comprehension, retard.
This includes the computer if you dont already have one OP is retarded ignore him
Most likely fake because that would be business suicide.They've already hinted that the price will be anywhere from $300-$500 anyway.It's nothing more than a gimmick that will last as long as a modern day MMO game
Try actually reading the article
Actually going to click bait when OP phrases his thread as obvious bait
I took the bait.Article merely states that you need a contemporary PC setup to run the rift. Its specs already recommend an I5, 8gb ram, a gtx970 or equivalent and windows 7.Nothing has changed
That's not because the headset itself will be particularly expensive, but that you will need to essentially invest in an entire PC...B-But 4k vidya games will need a more a powerful computer to run them, you'll end up paying much more than the monitor to even play at 4kBig whopti fuckin' do.
Oculus even published recommended specs for a Rift-compatible computer, specifying things like a Nvidia GTX 970, Intel i5-4590, 8GB+ RAM, HDMI 1.3 video output, two USB 3.0 portsif you don't already have this you don't deserve to own a rift in the first place you filth, in fact what are you doing here without tradesman's tools in hand? let's see your work permit, scum, and you'd better have a properly stamped one unless you WANT to end up in the organ vats
The product? maybe.The concept? which is being applied by a whole ton of companies right now Will last as long as pc gaming.Immersion is a huge deal in first person vidya, and head mounted displays are the single best way to go. 3D may have been a fad so far, but that's because most of the current 3D tech is shit. Having a display mounted in front of each of your eyes is the best way.Not saying I'll buy the rift, but I'm absolutely buying a similar product within the next 2 years.
PC is for work, consoles are for games, get with it. I bet you prefer 2d as well.

You're supposed to use the downvolt adapter.Noctua isn't quieter in terms of dba at the same RPM as other fans.But they're able to run at lower rpm and voltage than most fans. Try using downvolt on other fans and you may get ticking sounds or they just stop spinning.Another advantage is the sound profile. At the same RPM, Noctua has a more pleasant hum.
It's a lot more quiet than my CoolerMaster Jetflo.
It's just shitty sleeve bearing fan just like any other ricer fan.Proper OEM workstations use ball bearing fans.
Mah nigga.San Ace, Panflo, Nidec, Delta or go the fuck home

I've made a Django site for a company trying to replace an overly elaborate collection of excel spreadsheets that they've used for logging their clients, jobs, etc. What's the -safest- way to get the data out of a csv or xls and store that as records either using the django site or putting it directly into the postgresql table? Some of the fields in the site such as country are stored as foreign keys, whereas the original data just has the country as a string. How do I get around this stuff? I'm considering defaulting the country to where the bulk of the records are, and just manually changing the others. As for the rest of the process, don't know what's fastest.
The real question is why the fuck they would come to someone who doesn't know how to do something this fucking simple.
This.create a webservlet for it.
write a csv reader export excel to csv first, or read the excel file if that's possible, I dunno in python that inserts the data into database
- search and replace- big if/else with country-countryid relations in database importer script- do it by hand
this
Do you have any way to know which countryid corresponds to which country?These.
run dban on the server
Yeah, this would be good. OP is gonna get fired sooner of later when someone finally realizes he can't program for shit. Might aswell get it out of the way.
