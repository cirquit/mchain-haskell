slowpoke
literally the only reason this card is attractive is because nvidia put retarded price on titans to make cucks think the card is work that much
So the 980Ti is just a Titan X with less VRAM, right?
2816 CUDA cores vs 3072 CUDA cores6GB vs 12GB
If price is decent, then I might think about itOtherwise, SLI of TItan X it is.
$649Reviews all out since yesterday
$650
They've done this for the past 3 generations. People buy them.What's bad for AMD is that AMD STILL haven't gotten the 390X out the fucking door.
it's fucking nothing.
THANK YOU BASED NVIDIA
thisamd is taking its sweet ass time!my 560 died and now im running on integrated gfx for the past month.
Just buy a 290
That's literally the stupidest thing anyone could do right now. Not just because of Maxwell, but because AMD is actually releasing improved 290's soon.
Then I'll have to see how the performance scales between this and the Titan X.Then make my verdict.
I just ordered mine

why?
oh baby class="quote"telling myself not to buy the SC+telling myself to wait for the MSIwhy again
Holy shit. Okay then.Let's not waste 400$ on Titans, shall we
 introducing
supporting evgay Wait for MSI faggot. Don't buy shitty reference cards when Asus/MSI/Gigabyte and literally everyone else will release versions with improved cooling and overclocking.
It's over, AMD are finished.
Great currency conversion there.
a single 980 ti reference card performs better than my current 780 ti x3it can also run my three 144hz monitorswelp time to upgrade
a few less shaders.
I'm in the UK, where the fuck do I buy one? Also is a Seasonic Fanless 520w PSU good enough if I plan to over lock and also have a 3570K at 4.5?
true launch is june 2they say 600w min, but the 520 fanless are high quality psus... id say compare the req rail amps and its prob fine
True launch is today actuallyNewegg just started selling them and I think Amazon alsoNot sure about UK though, check the UK hardware e-tailers sites I guess
can you buy it in australia for a price somewhere around the 650US tag?
i would go with 650w
im US and have been refreshing. I know nvidia sold out via their site earlieryou have any links?
nevermind i found em. heres hoping for non ref models
some reference cards with the reference blower cooler
I'll just get a 970 since I game at 1080p. Then I can either upgrade in a couple years or just SLI them for cheap.
Will a 750W PSU run this shit? I finally want to play on max settings on all the new fancy games
So Nvidia shits out failures on purpose so they can claim their newest powerhouse is as powerful as their failure?And the only other option you have is to buy AMD and pay out of your ass for the electricity bill.Jews or electricity jews, who's the lesser evil?
Yesclass="quote"Minimum System Power Requirement W 600 WNvidia and most other AIB partners always take a more cautious approach to PSU because there's crappy PSUs out there unlike the high quality PSUs
Easily.I've got a decent 550w at the moment and a 660 with a 2600k at stock. Could I use the 980ti if there's not much else in the case? two hard drives and minimal fans.recons it would be fine.
Christ that was painful to read. Shut the fuck up.
How long until non reference coolers? Im looking to upgrade but will probably wait until the 390 drives prices lower
I just bought a 980 last week before I had heard about the 980ti. Did I fuck up?
The bill is insignificant unless your gpu is under full load 24/7.
not waiting for the 300 seriesnot waiting for the gtx 980ti killer
Waiting for AMD rebrands of 200 seriesTOP KEK
not upgrading your PSUnot adding more coolersnot writing the first working driver
people ordering reference card right after launch
fucking up this bad
AMD drops the ball againAnd they wonder why their #2We want to be #1 with our new HBMThey just missed out on the new customer base they wanted by releasing afterthe 980ti.
not releasing the card same day as 980tiforcing your customers to get tempted by Nvidianot marketing properly and letting everyone know you'll either bring superior performance or beat/match the priceAMD is killing me.
Anyone who just bought a Titan X is feeling pretty ill right now.Have a look at the oc3d 980Ti review - 42% overclock on the 980Ti, beats the Titan X in pretty much every game and benchmark even when the Titan X is over clocked.AMDs Fiji / Fury is going to have to be fucking amazing to top this.
I have a ASUS Z87-pro motherboard8gb ramTX750W corsair PSUi5 4670kWas gonna get a 980ti and 8gb more ram, would the CPU be too much of a bottleneck though?
Is the price to performance difference worth it?
youd have to be pretty retarded to buy a titan X even before this card was on the rumor millGod damn i love seeing people that squanders their money get wrecked for itFor those that has enough money, hey.. no biggie right, you can afford it.
Not at all. Have you overclocked your 4960K? If not, do it.
Typically high performance desktop CPUs+mainboardand all components therein will draw ~220w off the wall. Newer mobos tend to want 80 watts, depending on how much RAM, how many HDDs, etc. An OC'd high-end CPU should be taking 120-140w I assume intel, not amd hereA high end GPU these days wants ~250w, some lower or rarely higher depending on your usage/clocks and definition of "high end"So that's 470w, not counting fans and accessories.Let's call the final number 520w to make tings simple.Factor in the recommended 20% PSU headroom and you should want a good quality 650w unit, optimally.But a 550 will work provided it isn't cheap and running high strung. I wouldn't do it personally.
Yes.
Why are video cards so expensive?Its literally just more streaming cores and more vram.
For whatever reason my computer blue screens after a while when playing certain games after overclocking, ran multiple tests on every component and stress tested them and nothing showed anything wrong, but removing the OC removed the blue screens, so I wouldn't dare anymore
Because Nvidia.So I told consumers we are selling a $1000 gpuThey actually bought it, the absolute madmen
AMD should really fire all their marketing and planning employees.
You need to increase core voltage as well as clock speed, while keeping temperatures manageable. It's a balancing act of maximum speed versus minimum volts. Aftermarket cooling really helps with stability.
Any word on when the Strix version will be available?
Which will be a tiny bit improved with none of the insanely cheap benefits of the 290s.HBM and Omega 2.0 ain't nothin' but a thang
Curious, the latest charts from pcgamer show an SLI 980 setup smashing the the 980ti out of the park across multiple games. Worth doing that instead since its only a hundred or so more dollars?
Are you retarded?
Sli / xfire is never worth it
depends on the game, SLI support has been pretty decent recently, but just make sure the games you want to play actually do support SLIand that you have the power supply to handle it, you need what, 700~800 watts for a normal system with overclocked twin GTX 980s? versus 600~650 watts for a single overclocked 980 Ti?
you sleep all yesterday, you fuck?
 being this mad
Hopefully the 970 and 980 drop in price enough from this that I can justify upgrading from my 750Ti.
so if 980 sli is 60-70% better than one 980and an oc'd 980ti is upto 50% better than a 980I'd say just get a 980ti and oc it. a high oc will get 30-50% better pref than a 980 without the troubles of sli
What's the manufacturing cost of 6GB VRAM anyway?
Nvidia just made the Titan X unambiguously irrelevant. Why would they do this?
Many games run at only 1 less fps when running at 4k. Check out Linus tech tip's video.
Any non retard is going to wait for 390x and then decide what to buy. Why rush?
It's not even got the rendering capabilities of the original Titan, what the fuck, it's completely obsolete for gaming unless you need the vram
So that they can release a 990 using 2 980s at $1000 and a Titan Z 2 with dual titans X at $1500
I've been browsing overclockers forum and it doesn't seem like they even have them in stock yet, or at least they haven't hinted at itThey have the new radeons in stock tho, just not ready to be sold
Just like me. My 560Ti fried and I am waiting for AMD to do something.
Titan X is just a marketing vehicle to make the 980ti seem less overpriced.
They perform nearly identical. And since the thermals on the 980ti are better then it will boost more and perform better than the titan.
Titans are now pointless, only existed for super rich people who want to show off and to drive up hype when the 980ti came out at a better price
not waiting for aftermarket coolingbeing this advanced of a cuck
Running on integrated too.Loosing money fast, because politics and economics, I might break and buy a card in 2 days.
Because a lot of people who buy gfx cards are retards?
implying AMD can manage to be a decent competitor and push the price down
twin frozr 2 model perchance?
I'll just wait for Pascal's x70 class, which better be called GTX 1000.
no, only samey frozr
implying the titan x wasn't just the gtx 980tiimplying nvidia mater jew wasn't to rename the titan x to 980ti and make mass profitI have to say, damn these niggers know how to make profit. But jesus they're fucking huge jews and greedy.
I meant the 560ti that crapped out. Was it twin frozr II?
Where? their website is out of stock and I can't find where they are being sold.
Reviews state that yes that's pretty much it. 3-4% in real world performance difference in game FPS
You're the biggest turd in the punchbowl for dissing EVGA.  They rock,  and we'll see who laughs last when 970/980 owners can step up to the Ti for a few bucks.   What hardware company takes shit back for the cost difference? I can name ONE.
HAHAHAHA Riiiiight.  I hope your neighbors aren't on shared,  flammable walls with you.
Inspered by gamers. Built by Chinese children.
Which is now,  BTW.
for a few bucksYou mean for full MSRP, for only the shit models,  you cover the shipping both ways, and have to be on a wait list for 6 months. And when you finally get that step up you find out its defective and you have to go through their horrendous RMA process where they send you a refurbished dust encrusted GPU two months later to replace your new defective one but then you find out its defective again and repeat the process ten more times until you give up. Go fuck yourself you fucking shill. I hope you fucking die.
being this fucking retarded
I JUST BOUGHT A 980 WHAT THE FUCK
return card"upgrade" to 980ti for a few shekels more???profit
are you genuinely retardedyou've only got yourself to blame for this, you deserve to be jewed
bitchgamerlmao
mfw all those people who just bought a Titan x or 980Cucks....Time to officially upgrade my 680 4gb...I'll be set on not being a cuck for like what?? 6 months?Fuck nvidia, and fuck being a PC gamer. I need a shower
Watch that trickle down on eBay...Time to get 970 sli for $500Fucking cucks... Top kek
Is this the ultimate cuck card?
The use of this word needs to come to a stop.  It's not offensive and makes you look like a dipshit 12 year old.
cuck detected
You quite literally got all that wrong,  summer girl. Plus,  you haven't cornered the market on wishing I would die; I was WELL in line before you. I wish you health and wealth,  newfriend.
So I decided to get a 980ti.Which brand has the best one, or are there no tests/benchmarks across the manufacturers yet?
Just get a stock on and OC it yourself. Maybe get a nice water cooling loop?
Waiting for the MSI 980 ti gaming personally
said the cuckboy
because 980tis are all sold out does that make them RARE
fixed
What's special about the MSI version?
they are all the same dude. you could wait a month or 2 for custom pcbs.

Last nights thread barely went anywhere. Let's try again.Heard some rumors about a big Oneplus announcement tomorrow. What is it? Price drop? New hardware? Some other bullshit accessory not worth the shipping price?Also looking for a stable 5.1.1 rom. Any suggestions? Not too sure about CM nightlies right now.Also any Zenfone 2 owners? Hows that shit treating ya? Any news on rom support? Hows battery life?
They're most likely announcing the oneplusone 2, oneplustwo, one plus one equals 2. Whatever the fuck the name of the second generation would be.
L.E.T.V ONE PRO BTFO OFF EVERYTHING ON THE MARKET :^
Moto E is cheap the phones you listed are good value for money but not "cheap"
Also looking for a stable 5.1.1 rom
Take your no 4G chink back to asia
just got a moto e 4g LTE literally zero complaints, I actually prefer this thing over the nexus 5never buying expensive samshits or iPussys againvalhalla
Sub 400 dollar phones i feel like are cheap. Flagship specs for non flagship price should qualify.
how is the battery life? I thought the screen ppi was shit and had a bit of ghosting when things were moving around, but is it not that bad?
Getting 9+ hours screen on time with just a ROM and an app!
how? i get maybe 6.
oh its not bad at all. I'm usually one of those dudes that basically wants to kill himself if I'm staring at anything worse than a retina display, but so far the screen hasn't been bad and its had the best battery life out of the past 4 or so phones I've had, easily. 10/10 would recommend.
I love my ZenFone2 but I am willing to make a blood sacrifice to the chaos gods just to extend the damn battery life past 5 hours
MI4 here. Got it a few weeks ago.Coming from a Lumia 920 everything is so much better. Especially battery life.
i have a oneplus one and i love the size. is it not too small for you?
You forgot to mention the HTC one m8. I'm sure there's going to be an android m update for or soon
is the m8 still being supported? i feel like that shit is ancient now.
kek'd
Does it have a removable battery and sd card?
 Youis the m8 still being supported? i feel like that shit is ancient now.Probably not. I was referring to custom ROMs because who prefers stock, anyway?
25R and greenifyI personally wish it were bigger, but I'm in the minority I'm sure, I'd like a phone about the size of the Nvidia shield
OnePlus is the name of the company.One is the name of their first phone.So it stands to reason that if they announce a new phone tomorrow it will likely be the OnePlus Two.
25R and greenifythe fuck is so special about 25r? only people i've ever seen vouch for 25r for this holy grail of battery life are the punjabs on the oneplus forums
yay or nay
redmi 2's fat ass bezel is ugly as fuck. no.
Zenfone 2 or Moto G?
zenfone 2 no question. moto g even second gen is way underpar spec wise compared.
cheap phone general and no mention of brand new unlocked lg g2s? shit can be had under $200 burgerbucks all day on many different carriers. has solid rom support, and even on aosp based roms like cm12 you're getting flagship performance and 5-6 hours of screen on time with no tweaks.
Switching to T-Mobile soon and I want a phone for at max $175, preferably closer to $100 or $150, or less if the phone is good enough.What's the best in this range?
what theme are you using on cm12?
moto G second gen. add 25 bucks to that budget and zenfone 2 is your choice.
No LTE?  And where can I get a ZenFone 2 for $200?
OP here. Oneplus One, i don't use a theme. Are there any good ones?about the no lte.

What does /g/ think of BLU phones?They're less than $200, some look bretty good.
I've played with some at MicroCenter once and they're fucking god awful
How so?
Build is attrocious, and they were really slow. Like mind numbingly so. Maybe they've gotten better but I'd do a lot of homework before even considering one.
Did you uninstall/freeze all bloat?
I love the way the black vivo air looks. as for how they run i have no idea but:I would NEVER trust a display unit at any store. especially micro center. they always get fucked around with by customers a bit too much and a lot of bloat gets thrown on them running in the background and fucks performance out the ass. i do like reviews that show a lot of raw hands on though.

How is the Xiaomi Redmi 2?Is it full Chinese botnet?Is there even a better phone in the 150 range?
yes/yes read the thread
Why won't my huawei ascend mate 7 set the default launcher to nova launcher? Am I going to be stuck with this?
Guys, I have a serious problem. I think it's time to upgrade my phone but it's the HD2 so it's kinda tough to find a worthy successor.What chipsets are the best supported by custom ROM devs Cyanogen, Paranoid, Replicant?
Go into nova launchers settings. there should actually be an option to set it there.
snapdragon chips seem to get the most support.it's usually a combination of snapdragon/krait/adreno.
snapdragon, and the phone is OPO since it has many custom ROMs
It doesn't work, it just goes back to the stock launcher.
go into your manage apps option, and go to the all tab. look for the exact app that your default launcher is and see if you can reset defaults on your stock launcher.
ah wait, i just looked it up, you have to set it some retard ass way. here's the proper steps it seems.
How is the Xiaomi Redmi 2?It's just fine. Would suggest the 2GB variant, though, which -I think- still is closer to $180 than $150If you don't, the $100 Redmi 1S might be the better deal.Is it full Chinese botnet?No.Is there even a better phone in the 150 range?Depending on your needs, yes, but for many uses, it's a very good phone.
Thanks
I hope they update to 5.1. Here's my battery life with all bloat disabled/frozen. Pretty average
Looking for a cheap phone myself. Tmobile store has certified pre-owned S4 for about $300 or less. Waiting to see how much an S5 is.Worth the upgrade between the two?
Guys, what's the best dual-SIM phone? I was looking at the Zenfone 2 but it's Intel, and due to some development work I would prefer if I stay ARM.Any recommendation? Price doesn't matter much.
What is the best player and what do you use?
So, I can buy a Gtx 670 for 100€, is it worth it? Should I go for it?So far I've used a gtx 750 ti, it would be a great gap for me.Also, I have a phenom II X4 965, do you think it will bottleneck? Do I have to upgrade the cpu as well?
Bump, sorry if the question is stupid
Save your money, get a 960 or R9 280
KeplerHeh okay
Go get it then. GTX 960 is roughly as powerful as GTX 670, uses 2/3 of the power and costs around $200. Just make sure you have 2x6pins available.

/G/,The only place on the internet where people complain about people circle jerking over windows whilst they circle jerk over linux.herr derr its a botnetboth are just as useful and good as each other, stop fucking moaning already.fucking elitists
But Windows® dosn't respect your freedom as GNU/Linux
Fuck off reddit gaymerWindows is only good for muh games and muh office for high school essays
WindowsJust as good
some people are more than happy with the amount of 'freedom' windows givesyou can game on linux with wine can't you?
Windows is slow and a pain to install and the only reason anyone ever uses it is because it comes preinstalled on every computer because Microsoft pays computer companies to put it there.
GAMESThat's the only reason to use Windows and it's the reason I use Windows. Linux will never be an OS for video games, and rightfully so. I don't really do anything productive, so I use Windows.The GNU/Faggots on this board use their OS because of programming and shit like that.
Windows is a piece of shit. It isn't good at all.
nope, it's fast if you don't fuck it up and people use it because it works great, you don't have to code to make it work and it has the biggest software librarypeople only use linux for the "freedom" placebo and to feel alternative
/thread
Are you a robot? You sound like a robot.
Fag. Try doing programming on Windows. I cry every time. Bonus :only use Microsoft software for programming.
both are just as usefulAND as good as each otherfor normie work, windows is betterbut for programming and general computer related autism, gnu+linux is far superiorgnu+linux is a far better designed operating system though... without a doubt

Serious question: Arch or Gentoo?I tried both, but i didn't give Arch a chance more than few days, because wine didn't work / video card driver issue. Anyway i will install one of them today, convince me /g/inb4 Le epic arch fedora man meme
Why don't you try them properly yourself and formulate your own opinions about which one you like to use?
Gentoo is dogshit, its nothing but a meme or to boast about muh linux status
I sure would, but right now i just want to experiment a bit. Not enough time for a broad examination. What i basically want to know is: does Arch just work? Because Gentoo was very stable, but i don't have enough time for compiling everything from source right now.
But you have to admit, it is lean and fast as fuck, if the install would not give you several strokes it would be a quite enjoyable distro.
What about libre games that respect your freedom?
and rightfully sowhat's that supposed to mean? People who play games are too dumb to use it?
gamelinux with winenot really good.Some games run well, but clearly not the 'new' DirectX 11 ones or everything that needs more than 4GB RAM.At least ~60% of my steam games runs natively on Linux.But fuck, I want a running Dark Souls II.
Lets be honest, "Muh Office" is done by Libre Office or MS Office running under Wine.Windows is only useful for Gaymen, which is somethin WINE cannot always help with.It is for this reason that I run arch as my daily driver and I crap that up with none important shit, and have a windows partition exclusively for gaymen.
I work in IT, vast majority of our enterprise tools such as our proxying software is running under linux, typically Redhat.Windows is useful for workstations due to AD, and the general population's familiarity with Windows, and Microsoft's support for it, however for pretty much everything else you use to keep things ticking over you're going to use something running under linux.
Ds2 actually runs really well once set up, but the configuration part is a bit tricky
now it's GNU onlysee 
and you're too dumb to do anything beside gaymes

wait for huawei
Isn't Huawei making the N6 successor and LG is making the new N5? I am not interested in anything bigger than the N5. If there is a new N5 it probably won't be out until November
I myself is still considering a Nexus 5.In September.How silly am I?
I got a nexus 4 last november for $150.Way better than spending $300+ for something that does essentially the same things.
stillit never was, fucking retard. also, if you're white, buy a phone by & for white people. not this currynigger shit.
On an S3 right now and it's really chugging. A friend has his LG G2 lined up for me when he swaps this week, but I am not sure.
just get a zenfone 2
2500mah battery 1920x1080 screenNo.
This or Z3 Compact? for stock android lover
N5 is damn near perfect for the price and with M you should get better features and battery life
32GB N5 for $225. Worth it?
Lg g2 is way better for way lessBetter camera, screen, and battery for 140$
better battery lifeL promised better battery life in previews but the final release only made it worst. I hope M won't worsen it more
There is going to be a 5.2" Nexus so that is only slightly bigger. Maybe if it has almost no bezel it will be the same size phone.
Im thinking about getting a Note 4 as my new phone, would the Nexus 5 be a better pick?
you're maybe getting one more update after M, so that's the gamble. if you can get one used/refurb, sure, but at 350, unless you're doing something high performance on mobile, buy a moto e now and buy it's successor later.
being racistWow stop posting pls
This.
Get off the internet kid. /g/ is not your summer vacation place
You're way better off with a G2 instead of a nexus 5.If you get a nexus 5, enjoy having to charge your phone multiple times a day.Ofcourse it will, Android never delivers :-
good luck getting android Minb4 rootNo
enjoy having to charge your phone multiple times a day.Yeah no, confirmed for not owning nexus 5
Stock Nexus 5 has awful battery life.I had to install a shitload of custom crap just to get it to last a day.
L promised better battery life in previews but the final release only made it worstI had the opposite experience. My N5 would die in a day of having it sit in my pocket with KitKat, and now will idle for a few days on Lollipop.It's all what apps you use, anyway, the actual OS hardly does anything worth mentioning to drain your battery.
Nexus 5 seemed great half a year agoNow it just feels so tiny in my hands
LG G2 user here, wish i'd gone for N5. Only going nexus line from now on for a smooth UX
Thoughts on Nexus 6 if I'm not supposed to large phones/phablets?
supposedMeant opposed
Z3 all the way.  Went from N5 to waterproof,  three-day battery heaven.
Liar slash shill
I have one and its battery life fucking sucks, unless the next nexus has better battery life there is no way I'm getting a nexus again.
I can confirm this. I have a N5, a friend of mine has a Z2. His phone is miles above mine - build quality is superb, phone actually feels solid bit bigger tho, battery is maybe two times as good and he has an SD slot... Grab a Z2 if you can, they are dirt cheap atm.
I'm not interested in other oem skins. I want stock android and fast updates. Right now I'm using an iPhone 5S but am getting kind of bored with Apple and iOS and want to try android.

What IRC client do you use?
BSD netcat
irssi
HexChat all the way, negro.
not making your own console-based clientholy fucking pleb
using any software that refers to GNU/Linux as Linux
weechat
Irssi
irssi for cuntsole, hexchat if we're talking about gooey.Are there simpler ncurses console irc clients than irssi though? irssi has a lot of customisation/rice capabilities which i never put to use so it's pretty much useless bloat for me.
using any software that refers to Linux as GNU/Linux
this
fuck i meant the other way aroundit's 5am
WeechatI used to be a Hexchat graphical heathen but gave up all GUI apps. Weechat is actually way better once you have it all setup well. irssi is an ancient piece of shit.
gave up all GUII became a ricing arch hipster but don't want to admit it
Quassel
I don't use Arch. I had wrist surgery so moving my hands away from the keyboard as little as possible helps.
mIRC because that is what I have used for 20 years and I ain't gonna change now.
this
Textual :^
using irc
HexChat, it's the only one that doesn't suck so much and works on Wangblows. I used Textual on OS X, it's pretty much the best IRC client I've ever used.I'm planning to write my own in Guile when I have time to set up everything and install Linux.
This.
Quassel
irssiI leave it tmuxed and connected on remote server so I can log into the same session from anywhere.I know weechat is more modern and actively maintained but I'm way past the point where anything IRC related excited me.I used to use mIRC for many years and was in love with it scripting engine as crappy as it is because it could do pretty much everything - sockets, COM objects, you name it. That's how I first learned programming.
mIRC because is the most complete client
Finally someone said it.Also use mIRC
irssi like every console cowboy
HexChat, because it's not nonfree like mirc and it's not full-autist-console-only. And it's cross-platform.
50 megabyte sizeall that bloatfor a fucking irc client
what irc channels do you people go to?
interest based ones. most irc clients have a way to view all channels on the server and you can just join whatever one sparks your interest.that is what i do anyways
Weechat, because I never learned how to DCC on irssi.I used to use irssi when I had a bitlbee setup going, but I use Tox now for that, and it has a cli.
Hexchat

have pic relatedbought warranty from Best Buy because they essentially told me I could exchange at any time if there was any problems with itwant to get a new phone, but there's not really any apparent* problems with it*the battery life isn't great, but that might be normal for this phone, rather than the battery actually degradingis there any way to fuck up my phone without it being obvious? I can't get it wet, so that's out of the question. I was considering either charging it with a China cable to maybe over volt it or leaving it on the car dash in the sun for a few hourshow do I cheat the system? I'm paying $10 a month for this warranty so it's only fair
How Worried Should I be?If I could move the 2TB of data to a different drive, would a slow format be helpful?Or have I already started down the rabbit hole...
Which DAZ loader is the legit one?

what are the pros and cons to upgrading from windows 7 to windows 10?
How comes when I use MPC-HC + madVR with my pc connected to a 1080p TV PC  HDMI cable  TV box  Display Port cable  TV it creates strange white/black flashes and screen tearing during high motions scenes?I tried using less complicated scaling algorithms in madVR settings but it didn't improve anything.When I use ffd video decoder instead it works flawless. I doubt it's related to the PC specs: 8GB RAM, i5 4460, 630 GT 2GB. What do?
Tried connecting the PC directly to the TV?
Why should I trust a service that is being shilled so hard that it's on my taskbar notifications?
There's no display port on the GPU, since the TV gets the power through a cable connected to the box I though it wouldn't work, do you think I can get the TV connected maybe with some adapter? It's a messy setup, damn Philips.

TV doesn't have HDMI? Only DP?Adapters do exist, I had to get a DP to HDMI for my T420 to connect to my TV.
so I need to install an OS onto my new PCI only have the windows 7 key that came with my laptop, would I have to buy a new copy or came I have W7 on two computers with the same key?
Are you using windows? If you're on linux xor mac you can compile your files in the terminal.
prosfaster boots, better utilization of ram and gpu/cpu, more supportconsdesigned with tablets in mind so might lack the desktop feel of 7, umm? there's really no reason to NOT upgrade
You would need a new license key.buy a new copy
Yes there're no ports other than DP and the power, all ports are on the useless box some sort of mini pc which manages the smart TV features, like video filters and networking.
Yeah, I'm on windows
What type of connection is this?
Looks like Mini USB to me.

A lot of people have been talking about performance boosts being in Windows 10 compared to 7, are there any benchmarks at all to support this claim?Specifically, in gaming applications.
You can download editors with built in compilers like Codeblocks, DevC++, or some other programs I cant remember. Create and compile your files all in the one program.
I know that even W8 is better. But I think they're talking boot times and shit. Not gaming.I highly doubt it would matter too much. Just my .02$ though.
I don't particularly care about boot times because I always just put my machine to sleep.I've seen the claim made that games would be faster under Windows 10, but I saw the same thing claimed about Windows 8, and none of the benchmarks shown for that claim were significant in the least.
Yep, see you again tomorrow.
Uhh... Well, perhaps with DX12? That's all I can think of.I'm skeptical the upgrade from 7 or 8 will be noticeable for gaming speeds.
Not an issue I'm familiar with, my MPC and MadVR is setup for Chinese Cartoons.May want to follow a guide online for Setup and see if the changes help anything.I almost hate to say it but Coalgirls has a Guide, for an example. although it's probably dated.
so how often should I be cleaning my GPU and the inside of my PC in general?do all these fancy ass dust filters do any good are they just a minor feature?

Wanna run a dual monitor setup now, but the old monitor I have laying around isn't detected through the vga port on the motherboard.

integrated graphics works too, asus fans spin.Time for a repair trip? It's not in warranty aftercooler
Have you tried unplugging monitor with hdmi and then plugging in the vga one to see if it the old one works at all?
Tried, didn't do anything. The thing just stayed in powersaving mode for some reason. Didn't even know shit did that if it was connected to a non-idle computer.
Try getting drivers for it installed before you plug it in.Besides that, maybe VGA cable isn't plugged in properly at some end, or VGA port on the monitor is broken.
Tried it on two other friend's computers worked perfectly and recognized without doing any setting changes before I took it back home to mine. Don't know why the fuck it didn't work for me. The cable I use is the same one I used for theirs too.

I've got a question I wanna ask someone on here, preferrably someone with some real programming wisdomAnd I do feel a bit like an idiot for not being able to estimate this myselfWhen you start learning tech-shit day 1 you have to familiarize yourself with all these new things concepts structures etc, and as you keep going in, you discover more and more different fucking softwares and libraries and middleware solutions and languages and fucking I don't even knowBut is this still the reality of programming or game development or whatever, even after having done that stuff for a year or two or three?I suppose if I worked with like my static selection of programs and never updated anything I could finally be done with that stuff, but more generally, does it never reach a point where you're just actually on top? In whatever corner of tech you operate in?I hope you get where I'm coming from here instead of just saying "well.." like just what fucking is it?
You are never on top of any field, not just science/tech, unless you are the pioneer of said field.There is always some nigger who knows more than you.
This is an indication that you are too stupid to be doing whatever it is you are trying to do.
What I meant is, will there ever be a fucking day when I don't open some fucking file or read about some fucking thing I have to do and start questioning my existence on this earthIs it only ever learning, cause I've realized I hate learning and I just want to be done when I'm done and never have to question my knowledge again

I have an AMOLED phone screen. Is there a color that would run my battery done more than others? What color would run my battery down more, a blank white screen or a blank black screen?
Some time ago there was a hype and a pretty significant shillfest of some minimal xubuntu installation xubuntu minimal/xubuntu core whatever it was called. Can't find it on google tho, am i missing some details or what?
AMOLED screens do not have backlight panel, LEDs making up the pixels emit light and colour by themselves. That's why amoled screen can have "perfect black" colour, because when displaying black, they are simply turned off.Black colour will save battery how much - can't tell.

Simple C++11 metaprogramming: dear god fuck me, this is what C++fags believe is simple, if they crawled out of their cubicules and saw the proper languages out there like lisp, haskell, elixir and so on they'd see what's simple
the fuck wants to read that shit.I like C.This is enough to scare people away from a programming language.It's just not legitimate.templateclass L struct mp_size_impl;templatetemplateclass... class L, class... T struct mp_size_implLT...{ using type = std::integral_constantstd::size_t, sizeof...T;};templateclass L using mp_size = typename mp_size_implL::type;What the fuck.sorry, I'm not "smart" enough to read this hieroglyphic gobbledegook.You know why I use C and Python? It's fucking *structured*. Like literally you can see the FUCKING SHAPE of the code and start to like, speed read this.This is like - the worst of everything. Actually, that'd be scala.Sorry if this offended anyone who has staked their life on C++, but if you're not a video game programmer, there's no use for ya.
there's nothing hard about this. it's just basic templating.
It's just pattern matching on symbols
Protip: code that does complicated things is going to look complicated.99% of the code you read and write in C++11 will look almost identical to C#.Python is slow as fuck and used in completely different domains. It's laughable to compare it to C++.C is so pathetically out of date and lacking in even the minimum of modern conveniences and abstractions that it's kind of cringey that you'd even mention it.As for what C++ is used for: yeah, games... and operating systems, and browsers, and interpreters for languages like Python and really just any fucking thing that needs to actually run and be fast.Have fun being a code-monkey-- the programming equivalent of low-paid unskilled labour.Meanwhile, actual software engineers who make the world work won't even realize you exist as they actually build the future that you think you're a part of using a tool that you think you're too good for.
That's because you don't understand templates well enough.The lowest level is something liketemplate class TT addT t1, T t2 {    return t1 + t2}/* ... */some_class_implementing_operator+ x, y, z;z = addx,y;which is pretty self-explanatory, right?Also no-one's forcing you to use templates. You can code most things without them anyway.
Did... the have to::make it... so damn ugly::?...
I mean, sorry folks,but you're not *legitimate*.  You see, people have to be able to work and write code on a team.It's not just about you being able to "make the world right" with another DSL metaprogramming construct.  We have about a million coders on GitHub doing that right now.Please understand, you bring us *no value*. You have to be *useful* to other people. People need to be able to REUSE your code.Why can't you just, open your eyes and understand?  Simplicity is the best way.That's why I pick Go lang. Sure it doesn't have generics and it gives up all this fancy shit hipsters seem to think ok to bolt into standard libraires i mean fuck scala puts stdlib into the fucking SYNTAX, they're like, it's easy to read, ur just dumb.And if you DARE speak out. Expect to get banned from these fucking mailing lists. I mean, C takes criticism from everywhere since the 60'S.You know there was FUD about it back then. They were like, FUCK C, it's for hipsters, let's program AGOL or shit.Now C is mainstream.We can't say that the frauds and charlatans behind C++ will have the same fate. Just listen to one of Strousupe's keynotes:right. One of the most elementary, foundational constructs of CS. Let's just tell them to fuck off. And use Vector's what the fuck is that, probably like some array with 60s JVM static-bolted in the binaries.Literally, you fucking NEETS wonder why you are JOBLESS and watch shitty ANIME.Here's why! You live in denial! You can see reality!Sorry!Dude. It's like a normal C function, but with 3 nested HTML tags, and an ellipsis.Can't you open your fucking eyes?99% of the code you read and write in C++11 will look almost identical to C#.*faints*

hey guys, I'm clueless.in python, I've got a dictionary dicUsers with each key value having a list that's in a particular order. I'd like to retrieve the 3rd value in the list. What is the syntax? I was assuming it would be something along the lines ofprintdicUsers[loggedInAs[0]]loggedInAs is a variable that is assigned to whatever the user has previously logged in as.any help would be appreciated.
Replace that with the name of some class that has a + operator implemented.Or int, double, whatever.
It assumes that some_class_implementing_operator+ is a class which overloads the + operator. Can't you read?
Why would you care? You don't actually use Java, do you?
{'b': b,b,B,B, 'a': a,a,A,A}here is an example of my dicUsers, loggedInAs would be 'a' for example.
A hashmap/dictionary has no logical order. Asking for the '3rd' element doesn't really make sense.
I can... And you're not helping the cause of C++. This looks like shit. Now I know why we don't write software that matters in it.some_class_implementing_operator+ x, y, z;z = addx,y;Explain this to me letter by letter.Is it saying the plus signs everywhere are now like this:int hi = +2,3// so it's like add2,3?[code}
I made a class User and then did                 newUser = Useremail,password,firstname,lastname                self.dicUsers[newUser.userEmail] = newUser. So in this case I'd like to get lastname.
operating systemsinterpreters for languages like PythonWritten in C.As for games and browsers, some are written in C, some at least partially. Yes, indeed, C is used for anything that needs to actually run and be fast.

Obviously that's a basic example.How abouttemplate class Tinline T &minT x, T y {    return x  y ? x : y;}But a much more powerful use is for type-checked containers

Thanks, I get a TypeError because "TypeError: 'User' object does not support indexing". How do i rectify this?
Nope, look closer
This is a bit better.Thanks for taking the time.So this is a way to create reuseable libraries in C++?What are some examples of things you would build in Meta programming?Can you show me some permissively licensed examples on GitHub?
&minWhy is it &min?It's a reference?What does inline do?
Looks like vigenere.What can I do with these points?
reusableOnly within C++. Enjoy your name mangling and unstable ABIs.
inline and & aren't template related.Inline means the compiler should prefer to just put the code inline rather than making a function call;& means that we return a reference to the object rather than copying it.Also for some reason I implemented max and called it min. My mistake.
It's just so you can use the + operator to add 2 classes together instead of another function in the class.The thing that  the guy was trying to explain is templates.template class TT addT t1, T t2 {    return t1 + t2}This means that we can pass 2 variables of any type to the function and return the sum. If we have a class which overloaded the + operator it would return the sum of the classes as is defined in the operator+ implementation.
Correct!Points can be redeemed on the deep web for extremely rare pepes
I'm making remarkable progress but I'm not saying just what it is yet.Clearly it is an Edge Panel though.
type some long post in the quick reply boxpress ESC to leave Insert ModeGod damn it
So this is a way to create reuseable libraries in C++?Kinda. Most "reusable" cases are in the STL in algorithms and containers vector, unordered_map.... There's also even more generic  stuff like std::function and std::tuple they're both implemented directly as a library!.What are some examples of things you would build in Meta programming?I wrote a continuation library and a pattern matching one on types. The CPS one even supports call/cc and in there you can pattern match on the "error" type like this:    cont::call_cc[&]auto exit {        auto& net = NetworkThread::shared_instance.network;        auto request = { "{{"fizz", "buzz"}, {"asdf", "!\"·$%&/"}}, { .values = { { "fizz", "$$$&&$" }, }, .file_names = { { "boards", "test/data/boards.json", "" } }, } }; return net.postrequest .bind} .fmap[]auto&& res { using namespace static_branch; static_matchres, Casestd::string{}, []auto&& body { cout  "Response body: "  body  "\n"; }, Else{}, []auto&& e { cerr  "Network error in request to "  e-get_failed_response.get_request.url  ": "  e-what  endl; } ; }All of this without any casts except in the network code, which uses cURL. I also added support for matching on the boost::variant type including exhaustiveness checks.Can you show me some permissively licensed examples on GitHub?Boost.Hana and Boost.MPL11 are some really clean examples.
Here's a good example of why templates are AWESOME.Suppose we want to implement a generic object container; The obvious way is this, right?class voidArray {    void * values;    unsigned n_elems;public:    void addValuevoid *p, size_t size;    void *operator[]int index;    voidArray;    void reserveint n;    /* other methods */}
Make sure you initialized your dictionary as a list of key:value pairs and not vice versa. d2 = {"a":[2,3,4],"b":["ayy","lmao"]} d2["a"][2]4 d2["b"][1]"lmao"
But holy fuck there goes type safety.so templates:template class Tclass ArrayT {     /* methods from before */     T &operator[]int index;     void addValueT t { addValueT, sizeofT; }}and now everything's nice and typesafe.
 Inline means the compiler should prefer to just put the code inline rather than making a function call;So what's the benefit of that?I'm still trying to wrap my brain around this.
never mind, didn't read You have a dictionary of classes, so you'd need to access the class' members to get the last name.dicUsers[loggedInAs].lastName
Make an array of  0 - 4 and fill it with valuesCount the number of 1s in a bitmap of 5 bitsReturn a value in the array depending on amount of 1sIf I return array[count] I get out of bounds errors at valkue 5If I return array[count - 1] I get errors if there are no 1s -1Why am I missing the easy solution to this
Figured it out. Array size needs to be 6 because I'm counting the 0 too.
Slight issue here is that basically the same code is generated for each type you use. Can we fix that?Yes.class voidArray {    /*as before, except: */protected:    voidArray; // Make constructor private so user can't accidentally create voidarrays, violating type-safety};template class Tclass ArrayT : private voidArray {public:     void addValueT t { voidArray::addValuet, sizeofT; }     T &operator[]int index { return *voidArray::operator[]index; }     Array { //constructor }     /* etc */};//Usage:Arrayint myArray;x = myArray[5];myArray[6] += 7;//etcBecause all of the code in the template class is inlined, there is *no* performance overhead over using the void array, but type-checking is strictly enforced at compile time. It's the ideal solution.
what happened if you make one linked list equal to another linked list just by lista = listb?
Language?
C
lista would equal listb.
Hm. I assume they'd now both point to the same list: If you modify the list pointed to by a, b will be modified too.This is assuming they're implemented as something liketypedef struct list {    struct list *next;    int value;} list;
so it's the same as     memcpylista, listb, sizeoflist_struct;how would you suggest making 2 lists equal to one another if they contain nodes in their struct? e.g. their struct isstruct list{   node* node;   list* next;}
If you want to do a deep copy, you want something like:list list_deep_copylist *a, list *b {    list_cleanupa; //Free any resources a might be using, and all its descendants.    whileb != null {        a-node = malloc1 * sizeofnode;        *a-node =*b-node;        a-next=malloc1 * sizeoflist;        a = a-next;        b = b-next;    }    freea;    a = null; //Fix the out-by-one error at the end of the loop.}
why are you multiplying sizeof by 1? and why do you need to dereference a-node = b-node?
I'm still trying to wrap my brain around this.#include iostream/* * This will be expanded into something like: * int add__intint &t1, int &t2 * { *        return t1 + t2; * } * * Test add__Test__intTest__int &t1, Test__int &t2 * { *        return t1 + t2; * } */template class TT addT &t1, T &t2{    return t1 + t2;}/* * This will be expanded into something like: * struct Test__int * { *        int value; *        // ... * } */template typename Tstruct Test{    T value;    Testconst T &v: value{v} {}    Test &operator +const TestT &other    {        this-value += other.value;        return *this;    }    friend std::ostream &operator std::ostream &stream, const Test &test    {        stream  test.value;        return stream;        }};int mainint, char **{    int a{5};    int b{5};    auto c = adda, b;    Testint d{5};    Testint e{5};    auto f = addd, e;    std::cout  c  '\n';    std::cout  f  '\n';    return 0;}
Thank you very much, this solved my problems.
hmmm sorry i should have mentioned that i need to start to copy them at the end of list ai'll continue to work on this
x * sizeofthing is just how I like to format my arguments to malloc.If you didn't dereference the node pointer, it would assign to the pointer, not the node. So the node pointers in a would be the same as those in b, so if you modifed a node in b it would be modified in a.Also, really you should do something like node_deep_copya-node,b-node if the nodes are complex data structures.
Is this acceptable? it's an assembler.
taking t1 and t2 by non-const lvalue referencenon-const operator+ and no const non-member version
that formatting is terrible
working on an automatic torrent downloader for animes using Go. Using rtorrent for downloading its watching a directory. Dont really know how to check if a download finished though. Maybe checking the last file update time will work out.
Why did you make your code so dense?God damn, add some white space.
    Test &operator +const TestT &other    {        this-value += other.value;        return *this;    }He's implementing a += operator and calling it +Noooooooo...    Test &operator +const TestT &other    {        return TestTthis-value + othervalue;    }
Any ideas?How about breaking it up into smaller functions?This is really important to me.
Read and apply it to your code.Then it will look nice.
My bad, I just quickly mocked up the struct to show how's it gonna be expanded into add.
Add spaces around if, else, }, {, for, while, after commas and around all operators =, +=, ... except unary ones and member access ., -.Add blank newlines between logical units of code usually between if branchesAlso, yes, try to split it up in smaller functions.
just implement google's auto formatting standard
now this is a hilarious sentence. good luck
 Is this acceptable?No. Learn how to use lex+yacc and the theory behind them before trying to write your own parser.There can be valid reasons for hand-coding a parser, but "because I don't know any better" isn't one of them.
He said he's doing an assembler. All he has to parse is an opcode and between 0 and 2 arguments.lex+yacc seems like it would be overkill.
opcodemnemonic I mean.
 He said he's doing an assembler. Any assembler worth using needs a non-trivial parser.Depending upon the architecture, an instruction can consist of: a label, prefixes, opcode mnemonic, suffixes, opcodes which can be literal values in binary, octal, hex or decimal, symbolic references, register names, or composite structures including registers, offset, multiplier, pre/post-increment/decrement and a comment.That's aside from the macro definitions, data definitions, and various other directives which are required

How's this:big for screenshot.I plan to implement most of those things by myself.I already have a working preprocessor and data parser, next is instructions and symbols.And then the linker, and then the VM, and then the kernel.
What's with the Chinese?
This is all personal preference, but I think 8 space tabs look a lot better.You're not checking the return code of malloc and friends.On line 4, you're mallocing only 1 byte and continuously reallocing on line 11. That is incredibly wasteful. malloc/realloc are not cheap functions.You've put callocs arguments backwards on line 35 and 36. It doesn't actually make a difference, but doing it correctly shows your intent better.Use strtof's line 43 error checking properly like you did with strtol.Consider putting all of the if/else branches into their own functions.I assume exitmsg exits the function. You are not freeing any allocated resources when you run into an error.
exitmsg probably printfs the error and calls exit in which case he doesn't really need to cleanup the allocated resources because the OS will do that
i am writing a sound synth for fun using libsndfile.it works! the problem is that my sound is correct at the start of the clip, then it suddenly gains one harmonic every 16 seconds or some shit like that. the effect is delayed if i increase the samplerate but it doesn't go away.any idea where the logical error might be?i know my code formatting and practice is awful, but that's not the problem right now. #include sndfile.h#define SAMPLERATE 44100 //I also tried higher ones#define STANDARD_AMPLITUDE 0.04f#define M_PI 3.14159265358979323846//this is the sine function. the offset value, is meant to be a way to control the wave phase //but i don't use the offset in my code so it's not a factor.float SINWfloat freq,float  amplitude,  float offset, float value {value = value *freq + offset; return sinvalue *2.0f * M_PI *amplitude;}int mainint argc, char **argv {SF_INFO sndfileINFO;  int seconds = 68;  float basefreq = 480.0f; //the frequency i want to play  sndfileINFO.frames =  seconds * SAMPLERATE;   sndfileINFO.samplerate = SAMPLERATE;  sndfileINFO.format = SF_FORMAT_WAV | SF_FORMAT_PCM_32;//copied it from an example  sndfileINFO.channels = 1; //i keep it simple: one channel.

I'm at the end of my tether and and extremely desperate. I'm willing to pay someone money to simply translate this piece of code into Pseudo code pretty much like a literal interpretation of what the code is doing in the same format as the code. Here is the code:ever wants to help, make sure you send your PayPal details so I know who to pay. No fucking about here, I'm deadly serious.
Fucking magic. Now to refine the fuck out of this.Or tomorrow as I have to get up in 6 hours.Basically, it is an Edge Panel to launch MultiWindow enabled apps instead of the hold down back button and have it appear on the left side of the screen for no reason.

Your main function is asking you to choose which of 3 options you want to pick, and you can choose indefinitely if you don't pick the 3rd option quitFirst lets you input a number and prints whether it's odd or even using binary operationsSecond lets you input grade marks, tells you to resit if part 1 or 2 is less than 10 marks, or if total is less than 50, or prints out a grade if at least 50That probably wasn't an adequate answer, but in case it was, I don't know my paypal, so just e-mail me and I can e-mail you back with my paypal details:vinheim3@yahoo.co.ukIf it wasn't adequate, tell me which bits need further explanation

Use a dictionary instead of an array for key and letters.
I'm not sure that would be better just because I'd need two dictionaries anyway no reverse lookup to decrypt
Why not pass letters/key directly as the first parameter instead of a boolean so then you could just reduce the for body to:idx = mode.findchar.uppertranslated.appendmode[idx]You could also make translated a string and append characters instead so you don't need to join it.

Sup /g/,Need your advice, my PC just blue screened while playing GTA V, and I blame it on cooling, so I just added an extra fan exhaust fan/figure 4 on pic to keep hot air away from the GPU but I am wondering is this a good idea? will it help? and should I change it? Pic related, my Corsair 300R case and the details of my fan placement.In pic:Figure 1: 140mm Intake fanFigure 2: 120mm exhaust fan at back of caseFigure 3: CPU heatsinkFigure 4: 120mm new fan placed on side of case exhaust fanFigure 5: GPU fan on GPU pushing air downI am hoping the GPU air will be pulled out my new fan to help it cool down, what are you thoughts?Thanks in advance!!!!!
Block top and side vents with noise dampening stuff.Put 2 140mm fans in front as intakes and one 120 in rear as exhaust. That's it.
But my gpu overheated I'm assuming, so will this keep the gpu cool? as well as everything else? and is this setup ok and will it actually help do your reckon?

But my gpu overheatedInstall OpenHardwareMonitor and run it before opening GTA V. Check temperatures of your GPU after 5 minutes of gameplay.
am i the only one who uses a monitor for msi afterburner, speccy, etc while i do other stuff on my other monitors?
Ok thank you, give me 5 mins
I was actually thinking of setting up a dedicated smaller screen for monitoring my temps, too.
class="quote"The site also leaked branding materials for Radeon R9 390X and R9 390, both based on Hawaii GPU and both equipped with 8GB GDDR5 memory.Now I wonder where are all these people who claimed there are no Radeon 300 series but 400?YFW AMD faggots still deny 300 series is not a rebrand or is OEM only
380 is R9 285 with 4GB + more streaming cores/clockR9 285256 bit + 2GB competed with R9 280 384 bit + 3GB with lower TDP.So upscaled 285 might be quite powerful. We'll see.
All it takes from AMD is a Hawii + 10% to compete with a 980Awoooo
ayyy
This. If they get +10-15% with lower TDP and higher memory it'll be pretty good.
Anybody who isn't on 4K shouldn't give a shit anyway.Full tonga will be perfect for 1440 or 1080@120.
Is nvidia even trying? 2 year old amd cards are going to beat the cards they sell for over $500.
NOPE.AVI390X still slower than GTX 980
are going toA good chip R9 290X Vapor-X outperforms a shit chip GTX 980 already, all they realistically need to do is work on power draw and bin the chips a bit higher.
AMD can't compete with Nvidia's superior Maxwell architectureLets just double the memory on everything285 2GB to 390 4GB290X 4GB to 390X 8GBAYY
Keep dreaming nvidiot.
Being this buttmad over the bitter truth
So wait, which of these cards are going to use HBM?
Nope, because they are rebrands of 200 series cards
comparing card performance using vram capacity and memory bandwidthnever go full retard285 has the same amount of shaders, TMUs and ROPs as 280. It's not really a surprise that the cards perform more or less the same.
R9 285 with 4GB VRAM, better power efficiency and just a 8-pin power connectorI'm OK with this
actually the 285 performs almost as well as the 280x in a lot of cases, only when the color compression isn't as effective does it do worse
380 is R9 285 with 4GB + more streaming cores/clockR9 285256 bit + 2GB competed with R9 280 384 bit + 3GB with lower TDP.I too am eyeing up the 285 for a future build. Supposedly it's one of the few cards that are equipped to do Freesync unlike say the 280 or 280X. Looking forward to the 300 series.-- Pic related: I am a disgruntled Intel HD User

Well /g/, we need to break a PS2 incase my mates bitch ex tries to take it backWhat's the most creative way to break one?
install gentoo.seriously.
How about you don't act like a douche and leave other people's property alone.It's not like you even have the shitty excuse of personal revenge
It's a fucking PlayStation 2, go to a GoodWill and replace it for $10.
tries to take it back... So it's hers?
blast it with piss
put it underneath a steel beamthen cover it in jet fuel
we need to break a PS2 incase my mates bitch ex tries to take it backwhat's it like living an ongoing misadventure of niggardom?
he is probably Australian
Sounds Australian to me.   Maybe one of those stick inventors
Presumably, you want it to work OK until she pinches it? Or are you just randomly destroying your entertainment hardware?
Why bother? You can buy one for like 5 quid.
Jesus fucking christ you can emulate that shit, ps2 games even run better on pc than in ps2 itself, just give it back let them enjoy subsubpar quality of 15yo games
oh god forbid you destroy a ps2, like there isn't millions of them available online for dirt cheap prices unless you live in a third world country.

ITT: Underrated software
Anything by KDE tbh.KDE Connect, KTorrent, Kontact, Amarok, Calligra Suite.
ttrss
Krita is pretty fucking great for digital drawing.Too fucking bad I had to pull in all of the KDE dependencies for just the one program.
Oh, you want KolourPaint?!?!?! 1.2 GIGS
kframeworks5 is trying to solve that, dunno have far they've gotten with it. tfw no plasma5 version of kdeconnect
Good thing Arch keeps the dependencies somewhat minimal for most programs. I think it was only about 300MiB, but that's still pretty fucking bad.
youtube-dl and get-iplayer along with livestreamer
You can get krita with considerably fewer dependencies on Gentoo by disabling most of the KDE-specific crap.
Everything search
yes, the KBloat suite is pretty underrated in terms of the amount of bloat it provides. then there's Krita which is genuinely underrated, but still now when I run yaourt -Syu more than a half of the packages to update start with 'k'. truly disgusting
tfw no plasma5 version of kdeconnectThe current git version works on Plasma 5
oh thats neat. Shave I moved to awesome a couple of weeks ago
youtube-dl is fucking fantasticI also very much like terminator, krita, inkscape
Opera
Shame that as a DE KDE is fucking abysmal. Not even bait; I've tried every DE and WM out there, and nothing has beaten Xfce in my book.KDE Connect is pretty cool, but it'll be better when you can actually reply through it, which might only end up happening for texts. If it gets WhatsApp reply support protip: it won't then it might be worth actually using.
shutter
SpeedFanController CompanionDxtory
I just wrote a bash script to upload my xfce4-screenshooter screenshots to imgur automaticallywhats shutter do? like painting on screenshots etc?
I wouldn't consider amarok underrated. Always has been buggy and heavy.Agreed with ktorrent, is a powerful, customizable and ignored torrent client.
DeadBeef is underratedbest music player by far, global hotkeys / color settings / customize / volume control / supports pulse / alsa all that shit etcgreat player. by far the best I've  used on any gnu/linux in the past 10 years
kate is great as well.. customize mah colorz and the thing is fucking great, split screen in any way.. it's like terminator is for terminals, very versatile etc
allows selections/windows, keeps a history, uploads to various file hosts, and has edit stuff, yeah.
deadbeed and clementine are my favourite players. So damn functional.

KDE needs to drop that retarded naming convention.KKK
cantatabest graphical mpd client
you need to drop that autism.Should apple stop with naming things iSomthing?They are building a brand
stop using the thing that primarily identifies something as belonging to the KDE desktop suiteYou need to drop that retarded autism of yours.
I think deadbeef is the most overrated music player on Linux, personally.It's just a shitty f2k clone that pales in comparison to mpd
no paned browserno library browser, have to download a plugin for thatAnd a minor issue:no NG/ES/EL playlist viewer, with the album cover next to the album tracks
did they take your baby away?
Too fucking bad I had to pull in all of the KDE dependencies for just the one program.They're supposedly fixing that with KDE 5. The idea is that they've restructured everything.During the transition to KDE 4 the KDE project was split into two parts.KDE Platform for the technology.KDE Plasma Desktop for the desktop environment.It was still a horrible mess eg. installing Krita pulled in fucking everything.Now, during the transition to KDE 5 they're refining everything.KDE is now the name of the community. This is kind of analogous to how Microsoft is the name of the company but not the name of the OS.KDE Frameworks 5 is the name of the technology and the successor to KDE Platform basically they took KDE Platform and made it more modular.The Converged Plasma Shell refers to frameworks that will be used by the desktop environment as well as other interfaces.KDE Plasma 5 is the name and version of the desktop environment. It is currently the only interface for the Converged Plasma Shell frameworks but others are coming for mobile and tablets apparently.Check it out, it's pretty cool stuff.
I'm not that guy but I have a huge music library and Amarok lets me store it on my local MariaDB database. This makes Amarok way faster at browsing/searching/scanning than any other music player.
Kate didn't do soft word wrapping last time I checked though. Which is strange because I used Kate for years thinking it was great but the moment I worked with soft word wrap in other editors I instantly found editing without it unbearable.Hell yea.Does KTorrent let you use a socks proxy? For some reason Transmission doesn't.
If I click on this, will it force me to upgrade?I just want to get rid of the icon. I don't want to upgrade at this time.
It's going to force you to upgrade whether you like it or not.
It would be extremely painful
Are you serious?Fuck off.
The upgrade isn't available for another 2 months.If you reserve you can cancel.
Uninstall kb3035583.

install gentoo
To reserve a copy and install "anytime you wish", does that mean I could theoretically use windows 7 for as long as I live?
Yes
Sure. You're not going to live any longer than two months, anyway.
who no updates master race here?
I got a pirated copy of W7 and don't have that icon. [spoiler];_;[/spoiler]
Learn to use fucking Google And no it won't force you to upgrade..
have fun getting rekt by a viruses because unpatched security holesthis isn't le piratebay trojan, this is opening up to complete system access because, while it normally gets solved for most users, you still remain openand don't give me that Common Sense antivirus shit, because there are shitloads of attack vectors, as long as you are connected, you are vulnerablemay as well use XP if you're just gonna do that m7

 Botnet problems thread. hey, I've got Botnet os, but there's this small icon that I want to remove, how? you can't, because Botnet I love privacy and customability
why would you ever do that hindsight will be 20/20 do you not even have sp1?I bet a large portion of the people that complain about windows here run it like you, then wonder why shit never works, even though there's a fix for itshits like a new OS in stability and other terms compared to launch
For everybody: it WILL download a 3GB update as long you hace Windows update activated, but it's up to you installing it
just uninstall the update?your whole post would be meaningless if not for the buzzword Botnet, so nigeria pleasethere are several ways to remove it also so stawpfor fucks sakes that's fucking terrible, where does it store it? %windir%?
BOTNET

mfw i realised my windows update is brokenit won't download shit at allnot even resetting the services and removing temporary files helpswhat do i doshit
Upgrade rape. Muh patriarchy.
Get a better crack
Is it gonna be any good?
FOR YOU XD
So why would I "reserve" it now if I can just install it once it comes out? Plus it's mandatory to have a Live account, fuck that shit.Guys, please, help me get rid of that icon.
This.
Plus it's mandatory to have a Live account, fuck that shit.DuhMS is pushing Windows 10 hard because they want everyone to use OneDrive, built in Bing search, and their app store
At the beginning of the win10 installation, you need a microsoft live account. After finishing, you can go to the control panel and add a new normal account, and remove the live account on win10. That's what i did when i installed the technical preview.
but it's legal. It came with this shitty ass laptop
Who the hell uses bing? I want my privacy fucked up by google
That's great, dears. Now all I want to do is to get rid of that icon, can anyone help?
bing is by far the best search engine for porn
As said before from an another anon, uninstall kb3035583
You can: a uninstall upgradeb drag'n'drop it onto that arrow to the left
I'm not even getting the icon. Do you need a microsoft account or something?
kekles
Will I need a CD key if I upgrade?
I would kill myself if so many people on /g/ had MS account.
I dont have one and got the notification for the upgrade
What you don't understand, /g/, is that you NEED windows 10 to culturally enrich your machine!
Anon you still use Windows 7?That's so cute!
Well you need it for DX12
You can still recieve all updates if you aren't a retard
oh, baby, you know I only use Apple.
DX12Getting the 980TiE3 around the cornerThese truly are magnificent times.
Yes my precious goy, you need that DX12 for those AAA xXx 420 sick cool new games of yours!
Yes anon. The epic goy meme is funny
DX shills selling their non-free API when Vulkan is right around the corner with an open source Intel firmware implementationGive up. You lost. I'm sorry.
I've got a pirated copy too and I've got the update available
Or just not have an internet connection and completely avoid making an account in the first place.Because ya know... Its an option. Its what I've done and I haven't had any issue yet.am also on pirated win7have uprgade icon as wellI'm sure it's Microsoft saying "we know you pirated so tell us" but I'm genuinely not sure.
tfw want to buy onecant because I have to save money because my father has a high chance of dying soonitll cost over $7000 to bury himits my birthday today and I'm going to spend it at the hospital and then working 2 jobstfw
I wasnt prepared for those feels.
If it comforts you at all anon, I know longer feel anything
It will appear randomly mid-session. I fucking saw it pop up on mine.
memeplsall of that is happening because you want to buy n/v/idia
You're funny.
microsoft has realized that it's in their best interest to get EVERYBODY on W10, for more honest reasons than just "muh shekels."
i fucking love you, anon. Let me blow you as a thank you
they let us download the update and not the .iso file
I just got this and I have a pirated version of Windows. Can I get it for free?
You are literally retarded.Cheap it up and grab an AMD R9 290, the value for money is way better than the 980, provided you don't mind it being slightly inferior performance wise.
You won't get a clean install right? Fuck that.
Windows will check i u have a pirated verson, if they find out it will just be marked as pirated.
Why haven't they unauthenticated me already then?
slightly inferior is worth the fucking 300 dollars differenceAnd even then a 290x is like 6 fps lower tops
I dont know, i will try it out myself and if the thread is still alive in a few hours i will report back
Pirated copies should just wait for some legit .iso on MDL and then activate it. giving out your real email address on a pirated copyEnjoy you're botnet
you can get it for free, but the new one will also be marked as "not genuine"

Hey /g/ I bought this for $9.99 at a grocery store.What should I do with it?
Okay, so I'm starting to panic /g/. My Catalyst Control Center stopped working a year ago after I tried to update my drivers on pic related. Use an hdmi to flat screen Since then, I've been dealing with just not adjusting my graphics. Yesterday on a whim, I went to AMD's site, and did an auto detect and install. It worked! But after doing a few more updates, and restarting my computer, Ccc wouldn't run anymore. So I figured, we'll I'll just uninstall it and reinstall it again. cont
and you punched your screen?
Well I went to. The program manager, and clicked change on the ccc install. Manager, and removed all drivers. Thing is, it even removed the basic driver.. When Windows comes up, it's just black. When I boot into safe mode, it shows the files all the way down to sys32/display something, can't read cause broke screen. I started it again, and the windows repair has been working to no avail.. I'm stumped... Am I fucked? Should I just find another laptop to use my harddrive?
No, my friend stepped on it a long time ago.
nice 'friend'
It was my fault. He was drunk and I had it in the floor.
'friend' steps on computer while drunkmy fault
That's not my problem anyways. And we're not friends anymore. Partly cause he didn't ever offer to replace my screen.
I just posted this for any suggestions whatsoever. I obviously can't see my bios cause of my broken screen. I can't access anything. I do have Kali Linux installed on another partition, but I never use it. Is there a way to go into Linux and put a driver into Windows?
could you BE any more beta?
looking on toms hardware for parts for gaymin pci5 looks to be best for gaymingo on /g/intel jew maymaylook at stats myselfequivalent AMD is $50 lessmfw /g/ was right
equivalent2/5 made me reply
There is no equivalent you dumb faggot, most of AMD's garbage is fucking destroyed by an i3 or the new Pentiums./g/ is never right.
Hear that OP? Most of AMD's garbage is fucking destroyed by an i3 according to /g/ and also according to /g/, /g/ is never right.AMD away son.
look at stats myselfI don't understand stats, only ghz and cores.
nice assumption you got there
It's posts like this which just make me want to make my next system AMD.If Zen isn't shit, I'm sold.
yes, if amd miraculously makes something that isn't destroyed by an i3, it will be a great pickup. until that happens, though, it's a bad idea, and this coming from someone who didn't touch an intel chip between 2000 and 2012.
buying AMD over IntelI can understand doing it for videocard but for CPU? I had a FX8350 and it got destroyed by a i5 4440, the 4400 is not even an overclock CPU.
Meh, you're all dumb for not buying APUs
So... You're wrong then?
In single core performance which isn't important... Typical Intel fanboys they clench into one thing and preach it to the world not caring how wrong they are.Fanboys Now that's just not true and you know it... Considering the 8350 does as well as the 4790k in most games... That means the 4400 is better than the 4790k boom stuck in your own trap

do you love waiting for stuff to get compiled and have fine control over everything?gentoootherwisearch
Arch, has best documentation. I think as a beginner OS it's really good as you do learn a lot, then when you go back and use something like Ubuntu you know your way around much better so if something does fuck up, you're not a sitting duck and can usually resolve the issue yourself.
Xubuntu.If you do insist on a highly customizable distro, go with Gentoo/Funtoo for muh cflags and muh use flags.
Much of Arch's documentation is very general. That is to say, you could make use of a lot of it if you know somewhat of what you are doing and are running nearly any other distro, Gentoo, Ubuntu, suse, whaterver.Although I agree with you. Arch is a good beginners OS. I started wwith it was scared that I would not be able to manage it and got on perfectly fine by reading and researching.Isn't Gnome technically better, though?
opinionworks on my machineimplying that's a bad thing
Since you won't do anything productive anyways see: NEET. Go for the one that will give you more /g/ cred, gentoo. Neckbeards gonna wet themselves when they see your gentoo desktop.Sad but true
I'm using Gentoo. But it's a speciality distro for those who need / want it.You probably should at least suspect you want something like it from your typical Linux usage patterns before there's a decent chance that you need it.Tl,dr: If you have to ask, Arch or another binary distro is probably better for you.

What desktop environment do you use and why?
the point of a DE is to bring proprietary UX to free softwaresince every single fucking DE fails catastrophicallyby sticking the user with any combination of shit design, poor optimization, and outdated paradigms expected of free software UIs, there's no fucking point
Dude, what?I use Cinnamon on my laptop. It's decent and has everything I need. The reason I don't use XFCE is because of the shitty way it handles desktop icon names.
still using a DE
WM's are the way to go, productivity is much better. DE only for eye-candy.
my own theme xfcemy theme involves the command "touch" and an empty config file so there are no title bars and no x's to close programs etcall hotkeysnothing too fancythe title bars just annoy the shit out of me
No, the point of DEs is to make your desktop have some semblance of consistency and sanity without having to burn several hours of your life getting everything configured right.
gnome+gentoo = god tier
whats a WM please dont hit me
"Women Magnet"*tip*
Window manager

Gnome. No need to ever touch the mouse for anything.And it actually looks decent, unlike most WMs out there.
Lollipop. The material design is nice compared to Jelly Bean. I'm looking forward to Montellamar. A ginger sling with a pineapple heart. Coffee Dessert, don't you know it's good news?
Gnome,gnigger.
XFCE and KDE.First one is simple but also worked perfectly right away or with minimal effort like a WM. KDE I just wanted to try. Still might move on as v5 has been a big buggy.

what do you guys like about KDE?I got some stuff from it installed but I only use XFCE minimalisticI use dolphin to browse files / sftp into servers etc thoughI guess that's what is so nice though, is anyone can use whatever they like on whatever they like
Gnome,gnegro.
UnityLeast buggy, just werks.
You got that from me. :-
MATE first as a second choice since Ubuntu sucks with GNOME but then because I can't be arsed to migrate back to GNOME on Debian.
Windows. It's better than every DE on Linux.
Linux doesn't have a DE, you know it being a kernel.
Unity.I hated Unity when it first came out in 2011. However, I decided to give it a try with Ubuntu 15.04 and I love it.
this, i just installed it the other day. I am loving it.this out to lunch your applications faster

I really liked Gnome on my Arch install but gnome-shell had a serious memory leak and I was unable to upgrade/remove it properly. If I installed Arch again, I think I'd go for XFCE.
Same for me. I'd go with Mate.
gnomegot a lot of golddragon size cuckroof over my headwhat moar can a man ask for?
So, should I learn how to use a wm like i3 or Awesome, or should I stick to a de? Do wm's really improve workflow or whatever that much?
I use MATE because unity is stupid and I like the function of the MATE menu...maybe it's a mint feature...the favorite apps explosion.that plus compiz and VSynced desktop features i don't miss windows at all.
I don't understand why people suck Cinnamon's cock so much. I've used it; it feels like a nasty Xfce rip-off.
Used it for a bit, didn't like it. Is it as customizable as XFCE? As I understand, I can make XFCE do dynamic workspaces like gnome with some addons...
Timeline of my DE/WM.Gnome-KDE-Pantheon-XFCE4-Awesome-I3-Xmonad
I didn't like it either, and no it's not as customisable. I don't know why you would use it when Xfce is better in every buggering way.
I want to get a distro that supports the latest GNOME version. Will Ubuntu do?
Yeah, and go ahead and get the official gnome build that doesn't have unity's bloat and spyware
Fedora would probably be a better choice if you want easy access to the latest GNOME or anything really. Someone will probably say "arch is better muhh bleeding edge" etc., but we all know arch is for autists.You're not autistic are you?
Windows. It's better than every DE on Linux.Integration gone overboard.That's why it's so fucking slow.
unity is the retarded fork of gnome which they've managed to make even heavier on resourcesxfce multi monitor support suckslxde is pure trash to get anything done onkde is heavy on resources but would be nice if any kind of integration with GTK apps existedgnome is retardedly bloated for what it's supposed to do, runs like ass on older hardwareWMs work but require getting hands dirty to make them workThe worst thing is i have to pick my poison. I guess i'm stuck with gnome or mate
Gnome. It's nice, simple, and looks good. It doesn't put a constant shitty 64px toolbar on the side of the screen, and multiple virtual desktops is pleasant to use. I don't really care for the notification bar at the bottom, but with gnome extensions I just simply move them to the top.
I've always used kde and then used a very non-resource intensive wm like awesome or i3 because I like to tinker, you are right the about gtk support everytime I open wicd-gtk my eyes bleed from the bright white on my screen.
I use Xfce as it is apparently the most balanced DE. I tried others too, but had various problems with them. KDE comes with tons of stuff I do not need whatsoever and consumes more ram than others; Gnome 3 started to crash on login when I switched to Catalyst drivers and I do need them; LXDE is great for older computers but mine is not THAT old; Cinnamon is alright but still features various bugs here and there; and finally MATE had the most bugs for me - random crashes, slow icon loading, applications not displaying windows or tray icons etc.
A-are you having a stroke anon?Do you want me to call the ambulance?
Some people get over their babby duck
I had this on sqt but i suppose here is better. I have been using Linux for almost a year and I still haven't a fucking clue how to use it. The only reason I'm able to use arch is because I copied a YouTube tutorial on installation down to every keystroke. I have finally decided to learn and I'm wondering could anyone point me to a video or guide to help me understand and apply a new DE, WM and so forth. As well as a customisation guide
srs? install via terminal and pick a new environment from login.read the wiki linked in the sticky
/threadYou don't need a DE. Using a WM is more than enough.
Do you know what a desktop environment is?As soon as you install utility software to go along with your window manager, you're using a self-assembled desktop environment.Using a WM is more than enough.Do you know what a window manager is? How do you think those desktop environments draw their, guess what, windows?There's always an idiot in these threads spouting stupid shit like yours. "but just use a WM", says the person who probably has a taskbar/dock installed, a file manager, a wallpaper setter, a notification daemon and other utilities.
Xfce because reasons.
OSX Yosemite master race checking in.

Sooo on my desktop I use firefox and I have chrome on my tablet. I am doing a web application that interacts with the browser. Last night I decide to see how my baby interacts with a tablet. It did ok but when I go to see the log info  I see a bunch of crap. It turns out chrome sends a request to the server after every key you type. What good does it come from this. Thats a lot of false positives just to gain a little edge preloading a page. Thats a lot of pollution on the network. I find it rude. Its just rude and inconsiderate programming. Its like a guy pushing and shoving everyone else just to be first.
It was a good video card in their short time I guess, but what the hell, warming oven as the devil. I remember that year began to have problems playing Mafia 2, graphics precisely. Their capacitors were swollen as dead frog under the sun which the retired but never changed for storage in its original box and bury it in my closet forever.Recently it occurred to me to try to repair it, but of course, I do not have more capacitors. Someone knows what kind of capacitors are built? or if you can put something similar?

If you care about build quality get a E series Latitude

Previous thread:Used ThinkPad Buyers Guide:- Info on ThinkPads and running GNU+Linux on them:service guides w/ tutorial videos:
So, do the latest thinkpads t-series obviously still have rollcages?And is there anything bad about the t450s compared to the t450? Where do they save the weight?
How much would you pay for a T500?

What are rollcages?

What's the best way to clean the exterior of your thinkpad? Whatever I do it still looks dirty.
Oh wow, didn't expect a yoga to have one of those. Why do people shit on it of its build quality is good?
thinkpad a shit
bump for interestI tried lightly-soaped cellulose sponge once, it seemed to have an effect, but when the water dries off, it leaves traces sometimes.I have heard that water and microfiber cloth works tho
Are Thinkpad Edges any good?
because everything else is shit
no
because they are retarded and confuse thinkpad yogas with lenovo consumer yogasnot really. It's lighter and thinner than T series, has better gpu, and better screen. Sure its not as GOAT as *20s and earier in terms of keyboard and construction but IMO the good screens and 8/10 build quality make up for itthe third gen x1 carbon is also a fucking beast computer that spergs will shit on here because it isnt old enough yet
Why
Why settle for less than GOAT?Not GOAT
The fuck is goat
because newer thinkpads aren't "less than" GOAT, they're just lesser in some ways and a hell of a lot better in others. I'd trade a 10/10 keyboard and build quality with  5/10 screen for a 9/10 keyboard, 8/10 build quality, shave 2 lbs off the device, and have a 9/10 screen to go with it
Budget?
The fuck is Google?Enjoy your snapping plastic.

keyboard a shit
that keyboard looks like garbage, why not just keep using newer thinkpadssame shitty keyboard but it's a thinkpad
full voltage processorsthe worst screens you can even buy on a laptopyeah the autists will flock to it
Used a T731 for a while. The keyboard's pretty garbage compared to my X220's but otherwise it's actually a pretty nice machine. Shame they're the only proper tablet machines left on the market.A nice bonus: they're not made in China.
how so?
Just apply for the upgrade, your system looks 100% legit so you won't have licensing problems.
See, I was wondering how hard it would be to take apart on of the stand alone thinkpad usb keyboards and transplant it into a another machine.Full voltage processor is badwut? some people actually need to do work on their machines you know. Anyways they have the same model with a ULV and a 1080p and+ screen.
wut? some people actually need to do work on their machines you know. Anyways they have the same model with a ULV and a 1080p and+ screen.The ULV processors are a better bin.  You can always run a ULV at a higher voltage and overclock the everloving shit out of it.
i just installed ubuntu 15.04 on an x200 tablet.  Anons how do I get the ubuntu/digitalizer to work?  Please help.  Thanks!
Not sure.  All that shit just works on Fedora.  Even the Gnome 3 built in calibration works.
I just did the whole system updating... let me check if it detect that it's a tablet and lot the proper driver automagically.
install windows
aren't Intel laptop processors locked?
Fedora well, RHEL is what Pixar and Dreamworks run.  Red Hat puts a lot of work into tablet and Wacom stuff working right.
Core2 and Nehalem here... shit's only partially locked, and you can always pinmod to do anything you want.  Got an L7700 running at 2.6GHz 50% overclock at stock voltage.
Oh i see.  Yeah i know windows automagically detect it and works.  my last x200 tablet i had windows 10 on it and worked flawlessly.  However, sold it for a nice $100.  I got another x200 tablet this past Thursday.
$100 profit i should mention.
And Fedora which to my understanding is basically a consumer-tier beta test of RHEL has all these features from RHEL?
Works otb on OpenSUSE too. At least for the x220 tablet.
Yes.  RHEL is a fork of Fedora that is branded differently and maintained for longer.
But seriously, thinkpad enthusiasts have been going on about the death of the thinkpad since the T400. They'll get over it and accept that the *50's and x 1 carbons are perfectly fine like they did with every single other thinkpad that's been released since lenovo took over except the *40 because of the  lack of trackpoint buttons
maybe after 5 years... /tpg/ like the price point of old-er thinkpads :
But seriously, thinkpad enthusiasts have been going on about the death of the thinkpad since the T400Ha ha, no, it's been going on a lot longer than that. Late 90's at least.

Is there any thinkpad better than my t60p/t61 frankenpad with a t9500 CPU and a 1600x1200 screen?
this
Second.Well, I still have my X61T.  Once it's too slow to use, I'm leaving computers and taking up farming.
i fucking hate modern 'tablets' that detach from or fold over the keyboardconvertibles are more versatile, and often have better hardware
i agree... having the keyboard as a computer stand is kind of ridiculous.  I don't know which genius come up with this kind of shit.  Funny thing is other companies also copying the same thing... dumb following dumber.
t400 with t9600 and 1440x900 screen. Libreboot, faster processor, cheaper RAM.
That screen is garbage compared to mine, so no
Nope.
Once the x220 and the t420 are too old to use for daily computing, the ThinkPad age will be over.I'll be moving onto macs personally.
That won't happen.
agreed. Not too keen on macs though. Windows 10 looks really nice. probably just switch to Dell XPS or something
But when will that be? How long before they truly become obsolete?
see 
It will though, eventually. Tech will continue to move on.
Any cheap beat up thinkpads I can buy as a shell that supports a 1080p LCD replacement, SSD, etc?It appears that they don't have 1080p screens sub T500 models.
I got a Yoga 11e for $120 and its not that fucking bad tbh price wise, comparing it to the X130e I got for $130 last year, I think it was stolen but I am guessing the guy really needed cashNo computrace, but it did come with an embossed logo of the school district he was from supposidly, bios password but the HDD password he gave me and I was able to boot from an USB to reinstall windows.So far this thing is OK, but I cant seem to get the touch screen functions right, maybe I should get Windows 8 instead of 8.1 Pro...Also there's a problem with this thing and its keyboard, it doesnt work unless you connect a USB at times, it has something to do with flipping the laptop in tablet mode.I think Tablet mode is OK, but once the rubber feet goes bad on the keyboard it would rub the fuck out of the keys, not a problem on the X6x or X2xx because it would rub on the base, not a big dealNo trackpoint fucking sucks, I am not going to lie, and I think it is shitty that its not here, but after drivers, the touchpad supports two finger scrolling which does make it up but not as greatHowever since I'm not a touchpad user, my wrist hurts after scrolling awhile.Haven't tested it deeply been only a day, supposedly it has a 6 hour battery life, I think I am getting 4 hours. But this damn keyboard is finicky so I'll need a USB keyboard to boot the fucker it prompts for HDD password to bootBut it doesn't bust out the fan like the Chromebook Pixel...
Build wise, it is not great at all, it is made of plastic for the most part, so you wouldn't get the ThinkPad ruggedness you'd expect.Honestly it shouldn't have the ThinkPad name because it is a consumer laptop with a better warranty/part availability.But you're probably seeing it in decent spec/price wise, which is totally OK, but its best to compare it to other consumer laptops its basically a consumer laptop with a business look onto it and a trackpoint to see if its actually worth it.Say... its like taking a Porsche 914 or 924 to a aircooled 911 meet.As long as you can get an IPS T series at or under $800 I think that is a good dealX1 Carbon is nice but I ended up getting a Chromebook Pixel for dat WQXGA IPS display, the gloss sucksHelix is way too fucking pricey and the Yoga isn't up to par build wise and then there's the ghosting issues.
There are rare T60s out there with 2048x1536 screens. I doubt they'll be cheap though.Chinks have also successfully put a 1080p screen into the X220, but we don't know much more than that they did it.
Is there a reason doesn't explicitly list the T440p model I should know about?
Too recent, maybe? T440p doesn't even have an entry on ThinkWiki.
Wait, it does, but it's not listed with the rest of the T-series. Odd.
The T60p never came with it as a factory config so it's user installedRare is understating it. You also have to add quite a bit of luck on topIt was the R50p which had it as a factory config and that's really not useful on its ownIf you were so inclined, you could buy an IAQX10N from somewhere hoping it's a real one and installing itAnything SATA won't have a problem with SSDs. But you'd probably want a SATA II or newer which does mean the T/X61x if you're so inclined to flash a bios too. Otherwise, the T/W500 is cheap nowadays anyway
"This Buyers guide covers ThinkPads new enough to fully support Windows Hardware Acceleration and costs under $500."What do you think?
Hardware requirements aren't advancing.A computer from 1094 won't run software from 2004, but a computer from 2004 can run software from 2015.Surely you're not suggesting that daily tasks like email and shitposting on forums is going to take more processing power tham an X220 can provide.If you're talking about things like gaymen, then you shouldn't even be using a Thinkpad in the first place; /v/
That explains it.
I'm a ThinkPad noob. Does the X220 have a hotswap DVD drive?
X220 doesn't even have a DVD drive.However, its Ultrabase docking station has an ultrabay that does what you wnant.
What's better for coding? A T400 or a X220?
X220 is considerably faster and more portable, but T400 has a 16:10 screen.
T61 with 4:3
I've had this on my watch list for a while now. Thoughts ? 
glossy screenMaybe if that's your thing.
That's the only thing about it. Price is OK I think. It's probably between this and a T400
So, did they improve the trackpoint in newer thinkpads compared to the T60? It takes a bit too much force IMO.
hasn't changed in years. Wouldn't put it past lelnovo to fuck it up in the future, though.
tfw I'd love to get an F9 but no-one in my country seems to be selling a model with mobile broadbandgonna wait a bit more and if nothing show's up, I'll prolly buy the T410 chinkpad.
I wish trackpoints were more sensitive.

X users, how does it feel being on a 12.5 inch laptop? I'm using currently a 15.6 HP laptop and I went to the local store to have an idea of the size difference and damn those 13 inch machines are fucking small. So how's your experience on websites and developing programs such as Unity Engine for example
Can you explain Libreroot? What does it do?
So convenient to constantly have on me wherever I go. Small size and light weight makes it easy to whip out if I need to do something fast.Low screenres may be a problem, byt my X220's pixel density is pretty much as high as I'd like, any higher pixel density and I won't be able to see text from normal viewing distances.freetard bios

Ran into some money and bought a 4k TV from Samsung coming soon.Did I make an good investment for the future or did I fuck up? Is there a lot of content out right now?
Luxury productgood investment for the futureYou should have saved it.
There's zero 4K content right now.You'll be waiting many years before everything is streamed, broadcast and released in 4K as a matter of standard.By then, you'll be able to buy a much better 4K TV for a fraction of what you currently paid for yours, and it will have much better color processing than your current TV.
You surely fucked up.There's content for fullHD, not so much in the qHD compartment and you will wait long time till you see 4K content available for cheap. Before that happens technology will improve and your TV will be quite shite, especially for the money.Never buy novelty tech.
How could I get a better tv in the future? If it's 4k today won't it still be 4k in a few years? What makes it better?Forgot to mention I upgraded from 720p.
You can buy a 1080p TV right now that comes with a really good panel, faithful color reproduction, and refresh rates that tread into placebo territory.They're also razor thin if you care enough.A 4K tv is much more expensive, sacrifices a lot of those features for the 4K display, wastes more power, and you'll be stuck looking at upscaled 1080p content for the forseeable future, because literally NOBODY is broadcasting 4K content.When 4K anime rips become standard, then you can buy a 4K tv, but until then, it's basically wasted money.
Current TV broadcasts are in 720p if you're lucky, otherwise 480-576p depending on what country you're in. I wonder how many years before we even get to 1080p broadcast TV, let alone 4k
Hey X I just bought Y. Was this a good idea/investment?Why?
4K anime ripspls noI don't want every episode to eat up 4GB.
you're typing on a luxury product you fucking faggot.
Goyimified consumerist retardation, that's why
I don't think a computer counts as a luxury device these days
Resolution isn't the only factor for picture quality you realize. I mean if you just wanted resolution why not buy one of those Seikis that are a fraction of the price of Samsungs?To answer your question the new 4k standards aren't completely finalized yet but one thing that's coming with it is Rec 2020 color and possibly HDR. TVs atm don't even come near it. They've only demo'd it at conventions so far and the results are stunning. I'd say HDR is probably a far bigger step up than 4k. Not planning on upgrading my Samsung Plasma until they do.
Anime from BDMVs are usually around 5-7GB per episode and fansubbers usually compress it to 1-2GB for 1080p. So it might be 4GB for 4K.But since Anime fansubbers are usually the first to try new video codecs no matter how buggy they are they would quickly release h265 encoded episodes at 1-2GB each.
Not if you live in bangladesh.
I don't want every episode to eat up 4GB.hating qualityMy GoT or BB weigh in at ~5-6GiB per Episode @ 1080p. Are your eyes bad or why don't you like high quality?AnimeAh, of course.
in bangladesh not being swarthy as fuck and having access to toilet paper is considered luxury, we're talking about first world.
But I don't live in Bangladesh. Why would you imply such a thing?
Are TVs still relevant?
Samsung 4k is shit. Their colours are oversaturated.
because you have a very west-centric view of the world.
Weeaboos are usually the ones pretty anal about quality. Thing is anime compresses easily so 6gb an episode is rare for them unless they add fake grain. I welcome it though. Hell I'd want even more bitrate. Those 25gb encodes of Mad Men for the last season were fucking amazing. Better than Blu-ray. Hell, way better than most compressed 4k shit you see too.
Right, we're on a western imageboard talking about western things.Why the fuck would I care about anyone else?
Were you triggered by his priviledge-centric view of the world?
It better be AMOLED.
For how long will they keep making up fancy names for different display resolutions.Can you even tell that much of a difference playing on a 27" inch display at 1080 or 4k from 1 meter away?1440 sounds like the sweet spot for standard size monitors 23~27".4k IPS sounds great on 32" or 42" especially for RTS once a single GPU releases that is powerful enough to play at 60fps.Maybe in 5 or so years it will become viable and the cost reduced to a reasonable point. 400~500 USD would be a great price point for a 32" 4k @ 60Hz refresh rate.
If you are using it as a TV by the time you get 4K content there would be better TVs for the same price.If you use it on your PC for gaming the response time might be too high. Might be useful for added real estate for productive work. Though 4k monitors would have been better suited for that task and cheaper with higher quality.As an investment for the future I'd say its stupid, but if you had too much money and don't care then fuck it.
hey /gee/my dad has ~$3500 and wants to compensate for his small penis assuming, m-mine is... by getting an 80in tvWhat's the best for the price?Not interested in 4k
Who
wanting to fap to cartoon little girls at 4kWhy bother.

all his pirate animu, anon
Give me a single reason why should I have more than 4GB an a fucking cheap build that I'm never gonna do recent gaymes on, fucking retards. I barely use 3/4 of my ram with 200 tabs in Firefox and 20 other windows.chkdsk just freeze at 26%, I ran a benchmark with HDTune few months agoWork, animu, vidya, music, adobe products and other heavy professional software, etc. I don't have a computer just to browse internet.
yeah I had that freezing issue when my drive died. CrystalDiskInfo should be able to check drive status without checkdisk. extra point if you install the anime edition.
Single reasonI'll say this. The cheapest build I have offered since at least last year has included 8 GB of memory because from my experience 4 GB just chokes way too easily from all sorts of shit, including games.I barely use 3/4 of my ram with 200 tabs in Firefox and 20 other windowsBarely using 4 GB of ram with 200 tabs in Firefox and 20 other windows Saved. Might be a new meme.
You shouldn't have your anime/vidya/music on the C drive.Heck, you shouldn't have most things on the C drive. Enjoy loosing everything.
It's an hardware problem, autistssure but i find it hard to believe it would be this bad with a more sane operating system
Only with Firefox and ~150 tabs. What do you say now?I never had problems with 4GB, and I'm a crazy multitasker ADHD lord.I plan on getting an SSD for the OS and programs and a 3TB+ HDD for all the other shitsYou mean a bunch of badly glued package with no real software and drivers? Sure.
Do you have those neatly filed away under trees?
anime is video you fucking artist there's nothing special about it just because you're in love with the little girls.

Don't listen to them I have 4gb RAM and all works fine.I even had 3gb years go because my  RAM was faulty and It works without any freezes, I could play vidya from 2009-2014.Sorry I dont know what problem do you have with your PC but g is not your fixing center.
You should have a minimum of 10% free disk space.  Clear it up and your performance will improve.My advice would be to keep this as a data drive and run the OS off of a cheap SSD.
What is "defrag" for $100?
Recommended cheap SSD for OS?
How the fuck? My Firefox uses 1.5gigs or more after 40 tabs. Nearly all aren't videos. What addons are you using?
You mean a bunch of badly glued package with no real software and driversclass="quote"gcccoreutilsgdbvalgrindterminal emulators urxvtncursesposixWm's like i3anything gnuLike I really don't even know where to begin you're just so wrong.When I hear this it just means you don't program and haven't actually done any real work on your computer
Pic related for the addons. Firefox 38 "classic" 32 bit on W8.1 x64.There are good "software" for programmers that are allergic to GUI, yes. Now find me a good IDE like Visual Studio, or anything that is not programming, like Adobe suite, MS Office, you see what I mean.I spend my entire days on computer when I'm not sleeping or cooking/eating, and I'm not just some NEET with autismbux playing vidya all day, I make money from home, so of course I program daily, even if I'm more specialized in other things.
THISIt even speeds it my SSDs
Stop raging and dont listen to the "install gentoo" maymay shills and all the fucks bitching about your 4GB of RAM.Here is what you'll do:buy 50-60$ 128Gb SSD Kingston is a good value one, just look one up on amazon or w/euse shitty old HDD as secondary drive?????profitIt really is that simple.
Sounds like your HDD is dying, so Windows switched to a much slower read/write algorithm that double checks everything to make sure you dont lose information.
Are you on a fresh install op? Sometimes windows launches the file indexer to quicken file searches and it lags up the hdd a bit. Just open task manager and from the performance tab go to resource monitor. Click the hard disk tab and check what exe is causing that much read/write to your hdd
I can't rely on the shitty old HDD that I'm currently using, it's probably gonna die soon, and it's a pain to browse files with it's damn slowness. I need lot of space, so an SSD can wait as it's just a speed boost for the OS, and it's ridiculously expensive for tiny space.It's an 1 year old install W8.1 Pro x64 running perfectly fine, except that the HDDhandicaps everything .I checked resource monitor, explorer.exe is what's causing most of the read/write. Does file indexing still have bad performances? I used to disable the service back then at the time when I was on W7.
Are you fuckin retarded? Just throw that piece of shit in the bin and get an ssd already. God how can anyone be THAT stupid.
and it's ridiculously expensive for tiny spaceLiterally 60 bucks for 120 Gigs.OK, kill yourself now.
Speaking of HDDs my main HDD only is getting read and write speed of about 120MB, while my second HDD is hitting 180-190MB.What could be the problem? C: is almost filled 92% should I move files to the other HDD or could it be the HDD is dying already to be giving those lower speed, its speed used to be near the 180MB before.
Yea, 60 bucks for 120 gigs. You can't put anything on it but the OS and programs that are not games. For 60 bucks I can get 2 To of HDD.
10 year old HDDAlready tells enough that you should consider replacing it

Old hdd are really shitty and usually work a bit bad with modern OSes. Windows 8.1 is especially bad at this, many of the budget 8.1 laptops i've seen come with shitty 5400rpm hdd and they lag like hell. A friend of mine had an i7 + 850m laptop that took a few seconds only to open an Explorer tab and the disk was always 100% like you.To this day I still have no idea wtf this is. Just put w7 on it or buy a new hdd, i've tried a lot but never found a solution
Anyone?How would I go about troubleshooting this?
Defrag it. Otherwise it's just because its almost full
This is from moving files from my mine HDD to a second HDD.CrysyalDisckMarkAnime edition test also shows speed of 120MB read/write  it's only 2% fragmented..I'm gonna a keep moving more stuff and if see it improves but last time I ran HD Tune the HDD was almost filled like right now but the speed was near 170MBs... that was like two months ago. I can't run HD Tune anymore the trial expired any other software I can use to test it?
10 year old HDDs with nearly 4gb page files will never run well.
I've got 8gb and I top out a lot. But then again I disable page file while you probably use a large one.You can top out pretty quickly from photoshop + blender + chrome, for example. It really adds up if you have a lot of things open in the background like skype, mumble, teamspeak, etcEveryone should buy what they need, people have different needs.

tfw decide to make game on blendertfw worst decision on my lifethe modeling part of it is okay for me, but the blender game engine is sucks compared to another game engine, even unity.
not making your own game engine.Fucking casual.
where do i start?what language?
3D modeling programgame engineu wot m8
C and SDL
implying never tried blenderonly read from wikiu wot m8
wasting time on things that you already have perfectly good tools for
and what tools?
Not being able to spot when a project is serious and when it's just people messing aroundYour fault for using the blender game engine, it's obviously just a toy.
are you telling me all i need to do is to change game engine?the modelling part is okay though.
C++ and SFML.
Anon, any seriously competent game engine can import models via DAE or FBX nowadays so don't even think about using that POS in-built game engine in blender.
Since you're a 3D modeller and not a dev, you probably can't code for shit in any language, so get a game engine like Unity where you just have to use buttons.You can always keep your models or convert them in whatever format your new engine wants.Just stick to well known serious products if you don't know what to use. Not the fucking BGE.
C#, just download Unity and watch their tutorial videos.
i can code a little bit in python, but honestly, even with manual code for everything, blender is not ready yet to be a game engineand considering unity, i already tried it but, well, i don't really tried it for so long, so i don't know how well it is.
If you can't find your way around BGE, you're already fucked.BGE is one of the easiest engines to prototype in... you just link basic input/logic nodes together.
yeah, it's easy to put node after nodelogic is just and or xor etcbut to change behaviour i have to meddle around and no blending animation on the fly.i got it working in any way, but a long way.if it's just a platformer game, or box game, bge is hella easy.but for a more complex game, like combo system, level, tracking, can't make it smooth without meddle with something obscure.any recomendation?unity - checkother?
Unity maybe Godot.Read the Godot wiki, it's a full tutorial.
godot seems promisingunity - checkgodot - checki'll try these two first.
If you can program in python, why don't you use pygame?
never heard of it.mfw read the documentation on the sitenah man.. 2obscure4mebeside i want to make 3d gamemodelling already take so much time
I think the best solution is to find a programmer willing to do a game but don't know shit about modelling... I would do it if it's not a too complicated project and if you're willing to make it open source.
that's the hardest part.
C++ and SDL2
VHDL
Not using Unreal Engine 4TOPPEST KEK, OP
at first i'm thinking about unreal, but at that time it's not free. and i don't have that much money.
Didn't got it, what is the hardest part?
implying unity is a bad game engineMan you are such a faglord.making own game enginemaking a gameTwo different things retarded shitcunt.If you really want to write a game engine you should use C\SDL for low level stuff and C++ for higher level stuff.
Not OP...But what game engine should I use on Linux for 2D?  What game engine should I use for 3D?Coding isn't an issue for me.
looking for a programmer willing to do a game.all the capable men i know, either they're uninterested in game, or already have their own game project.i'm sorry for being a faglord.i take that back. unity is great.
any license?
love for 2d, or flashpunkunreal4, unity in wine, godot, ogre for 3d
assembly
Alright...Which of those 3D engines would you say is the most flexible?
Lua / LÖVE
like the OP said, anything but BGEif youre willing to install wine, unity, or unreal if not.
Another vote for love here. Why?Easy to learn and use, can rapidly get something up and running, Box2D integration, excellent documentation and community, Lua is sexual as fuck.On and one very important thing a lot of people forget about: distributing your game is so easy with love it should be illegal.refreshing to be able to get something that works distributed so easily after spending hours wrestling with distributing games written in C/C++ and SDL.
Not him but obviously ogre
love is not capable for 3d games right?
That's why I offered myself
thanks for the offer, but i consider this game i working on will not leave blender as i got it too far to switch to another engine.i would make another game, in about one month from now, the concept is near ready , but it requires combo system, level and sandboxing. if unity can cover that much, i'll go with it. and if you're still interested, i'd love to receive a helping hand.
Is there a good 2D engine where I can just use my language of choice?  Love looks alright, but I don't really want to have to learn Lua.
And by that I mean C or C++.
stencyl, constructyou don't need language
Well, I still want to program...Just in a language that I'm already familiar and comfortable with.
Allegro is easier than SDL, also Irrlicht have a nice 2D support
if you're not on windows or want to cross platform, oxygine or 
SFML is pretty good.
The Blender Game Engine is like Scratch for 3D games, it is a good way to teach teen age kids how to make games. And even experienced game programmers can make fairly complex games with it. There is nothing wrong with it, its a great way to play around with physics and try out ideas for games
Why not? You'll learn it quickly; it's kind of like a stripped down more minimal python.
Use unity and c# or java like most sane people. Fuck making your own game engine.
C is outdated and deprecated by c++. I want this meme language used by hipsters to stop.
unreal engine is free
use libGDX if you want to like make a gameuse SDL if you want to reinvent half of the wheel and then give up
Blender does more than just modeling. It has a built-in game engine and also a built in NLE Video Editor.
If you don't like to code, UE4 is free now and best for that. Blueprint is easy as fuck if your brain functions properly.
linux version distribution is impossible
It's the easiest of the three you fat shit. You just zip up the game directory and distribute that.Although I have been meaning to see if the windows distribution method works on Linux too, cat'ing the love executable together with the game. In theory there's no reason it shouldn't.
BGE is cool for some prototyping and experiment shit, but it's very outadated. No one works on it anymore
You just zip up the game directory and distribute that.That way they still need to install LOVE to play it
Not writting in straight binary code.
So? This is Linux we're talking about, it's pretty much par for the course at this point. When I get home I'm cat'ing the shit out of love and a .love though, it would be easier to be fair.
If you distributed through a package repo like everyone else then you could just mark love as a dependency, problem solved. Installing love makes .love files runnable via double clicking in a GUI by default.
Don't forget to buy the blender tutorials on Steam!

Can someone help me out? How can I fix this css dropdown menu? So that if you aim at Google, it says Gmail below it.All my attempts to position it properly seem to fail.
To add: my goal is to add top: 50px; to .subdropdown1But the problem is .navbar has overflow:auto which hides all overflow.But if I disable that overflow control, the bar breaks.
What I can use to sort HTML table from the front-end ?I'm using Bootstrap + php for the back-end 
I have no idea what your question is. You can sort html tables with html.
Making mockup sites for local businesses to help myself come up with ideas that I might approach them with.
I'm creating a store app and I'm stuck on authentication, should I just use simple password hashing or should I use a library like oauth or open id?
I applied for this entry level job that I talked about here last friday. Waiting for a reply now. I'm sure the interview process will be hard and probably coupled with a few tests since it's a fairly 'big' company. I should be practicing my ass off and reading up on all kinds of things before I get an actual reply, but I just end up doing nothing.I wish I wasn't such a lazy motivationless piece of shit.
The code is all-round shitty.Use display: inline-block rather than float: left for your nav items.Also you have div  p inside your a/, which is technically valid in HTML5 but again, shitty.Also name your classes better.There's plenty of css-only dropdown menus around the web. Take one of those and learn from it.
You can put all your entries into an array and use array.sort but this will cause your page to freeze with large tabels
It's part my first attempt to make a proper css website. So I've got no clue yet what good or bad practises are. But I appreciate the tips.I searched for drop down menu's online, but I didn't really understand what was going on. So I figured I'd learn more by making one myself. But I still miss something, so I guess I'll have to look again.
Ever heard of pagination?
Lets say you have a list of 1000 entries paginated every 100 entry, and you sort the first 100, is it really sorted? You still have to sort the whole list and then get the firsts 100.And its not like your moving the elements every sort step, you clone the table sort it then replace so its no difference in DOM manipulation.
I don't know the exact scenario, but wouldn't you sort it in your initial query?
Guy who built the c# json server here, got the ip add and port changing without throwing an exception and I didn't seem to sacrifice any speed. Twas a true and honest challenge. Still peaking around 15k, with the odd 18k in there.Now, I'm wondering if it's best to store and handle the actual json with mongodb? As in my server can do all the authentication and shit, then just send it off to mongodb if anything actually needs to be stored long term. I do want to replicate the full crud experience.I do like scalability and I'd like to use a nosql database I guess. Just no sql no exceptions.
but wouldn't you sort it in your initial querybingoif the table is guaranteed to be small and not paginated you can sort it client-side with jquery. for example 
Are amateurs welcome too?
There is no reason to use mongodb unless you are Google or Facebook that do multi-million requests per second. The benefit of nosqls like mongodb is that you get no confirmation if the post has been created or not so you can just mash in the requests. this what I've been told at leastFor small scale to corporation you should just use some form of sql. I use sqlite for all my hobby projects since it requires no extra server you just write to a binary file.If you are on node I highly recommend Sequelize for speaking with your db.

Get avoiding sql out of your head, nosql is just buzzwords.Here is probably what you want 
And I really do want to avoid sqlthen gamedev or embedded programming would be good areas for you to switch to, because the correct way to do applications that depend on persistent data is to embrace sqlthe only valid usecase for nosql is when you really can't avoid having dynamic/unstructured schema

You're right mr basement-dweller, they fucked me over, I am the product. My public information has now been sold. Btw I've never even received any spam in my mail
First thing that came to mind when I first saw these too.
shoah'd tbh
Perhaps it's just that the companies they sell too don't operate in your area. People with money would rather pay a few more bucks if it means not having to throw away a few extra sheets of junk mail every couple of weeks.
I thought you said its $1 only How do I do this anyway? Use your code for gift/purchase?
also do I need a credit card to check out? Because I have none but I am willing to pay them in cash when they deliver the mouse pad with UPS or whatever.
I paid with paypal
no credit cardwilling to pay one fucking dollar at time of deliveryThis is an 18+ website
I live in a 3rd world in Asia and as claimed by OP they deliver this worldwide in just $1. Why would jews do this? Is OP a faggot?
Get a paypal account, send the paypal account money from your bank debit account or pay someone cash to send you money on paypal.No, you don't want to use postal "cash on delivery" services, they're even more of a rip-off than Paypal is.And the Chinese don't want these added costs / difficulties, either.
Outside of america almost no person has a credit card until they finish univeristy
But almost everyone has a bank account. Use that to fund your paypal payment account.[No, direct bank transactions unfortunately aren't accepted on most stores.]
having a credit cardbeing an american unironically.
Gonna make this one.
PS: I remembered that Alipay also is an option in many cases. You could also use that if you don't like Paypal's  money leeching tactics.
Where do I put in the discount code when checking out with paypal?

generating traffic on this cesspool of a websiteIt's like you have nothing else to do with your life.I don't even remember how much I paid for a pass, like $15/year or something. I make more in an hour.

spending more of your time on this cesspool of a website by filling out the captchas.A 4chan pass costs 20 dollars.Let's say a Captcha take, on average, 10 seconds of your time.The American minimum wage is $8.00So, 6 Captchas in take minute, and 360 captchas take an hour.Going by minimum wage, since most states have a higher minimum wage, but then there's tax, most peopel are paid more than it by some degree anyway, blah blah blah....Anyway, working on minumum wage you make $20/$8p/h which means you make it in 2.5 hours.So, at 360 posts-per-hour, you'd have to assuming 10 seconds average per captcha fulfillment and authentication, keyword being average once you post 900 posts, it has become cheaper time-wise to buy a 4chan past.So the question is, do you post 900 times a year? Less if you make more than minimum wage?

ITT: Things other /g/eeks sperge over that you never did.Amiga. I used DOS then Windows 3.x then Win9x then Win2k then WinXP. Apparently people kept their Amiga systems well into the 00s. Why the fuck would you use a 15 yearold computer as your daily driver? Emulating these things to play one game is bullshit, there's all these chipsets and model numbers and CPUs and RAM size and none of it's documented anywhere. DOSBox just fucking works. All the Amiga games look and sound the same anyway, that shiny EuroShmup metallic was cool for about 5 seconds in 1993 before it got old. Seriously fuck the Amiga.
I don't know, my dad was a big fan of them for some reason. I made some shitty music with OctaMED and played Myst a lot. I guess there were tons of trackers/DAWs for DOS too and Myst ran on everything so not a big deal.
amiga emulators are hilariously hard to configure properlyit's because the machine was so far ahead of its time, even modern PCs can't handle it
The Amiga was like a PC from 1997 with a better instruction set Motorola 68000 dropped into 1985.  It blew EVERYBODY's mind at the time.  That sort of shock can create disproportionate levels of loyalty from the long term fans.
I bet there are video toasters still installed some high schools.
Like an Atari ST minus midi.

In the same way a Yugo is like a Ferrari, in that they're both cars and have four wheels, yes.

thoughts about Mr Robot?

I want to hate it, but the fact they are at least trying to use realistic tech makes me want to give it a break. tl;dr: on the fence

It's even worse that this one.
C'mon man, you can't hate on Mr.Robot. It's the first show based around technology that doesn't seem like some SF or Fantasy bullshit.
I know, hence why I'm on the fence. Sure beats CSI zoom and enhance BS.
I fucking love it. I just love the character Elliot

Yes. It irked me in a few places. But overall, it was actually trying to do something, good, something interesting. We can bash them for the spaces in the file directory, or for the fact that the character uses GNOME, not ratpoison or i3, but, really, this is something that seems pretty rare. It might get worse, it might get better. As it stands, I rather thought it was good, certainly better than most depictions of computer geeks.
when's the next episode on kat??
It should be in 4-5 days I think, since the first one was uploaded 3 days ago. also, not OP
America is a communist country.
Yeah that's another thing, i'm glad they didn't make him some stereotypical nerd.

i hope, there is no airing date on imdb or wikipediathe show is god tier. everybody knows that /g/ hates everything. nothing is ever good enough for them :
Exactly, /g/ will never collectively like anything. But if one tech show deserves to be liked, it's this one.
ending left me hanging so bad.SO BADI might have ideas, but I really don't know what will happen next. Fuck.This is tv series, maybe he'll work with these guys?
Economy run by the governmentMassive erosion of civil libertiesPresident in power due to affirmative actionNeed I say more?
You did forget to mention the part where you say America is the most fucking capitalistic country in the world.
yeah, no way US is communist. Communist countries usually have a middle class...
Economy run by the governmentMore like run by corporations and lobbies kek. You're actually living in a fascist state.
You couldn't get past watching him sit on a subway, then say "You're Ron" to an Indian guy?
The scene with him crying alone, it's actually sad. I can't do that, though. Guess I'm not that broken, huh!
You will never do MDMA with, and fuck your hot female drug dealer.Why even live?
I don't know if you are a shill seriously tho if you are part of the production there are other ways to do this or really like the show but there is another thread that hasn't reached bump limit.Also the show is good, I like it.
The USA have always been Fascist.
Read Moldbug, friend.

I SEE YOU'RE USING NOMEthat was the last straw. it's fucking GAHNOMEJESUSFUCK
This. Another reason why I love this show is cause it combines the tech stuff from /g/ and his personality that fits /r9k/
I think it's kinda bad when your corrupt government starts corrupt wars and kills innocent people for fucking oil/money.
I sort of chuckled at that bit actually. I have cried alone in corners like that. it's fucking GAHNOMECitations? I pronounce it like KDE guy did, but then, I went to a Waldorf school, and Gnomes were really the thing.

It's cheesy fun from the USA Network. I don't know some of you are over analyzing and/or expecting so much.I like it.
That was just the pilot, get ready to watch the episode again when the first episode is officially on air

More like coder version of Dexter.  He even has side plots of specific people to "hack" just like Dexter does to kill.  He creates CD's after a hack of someone just like Dexter does with blood slides.  Pretty fucking content stealing if you ask me.
Damn man, never thought of it that way!Let's hope it doesn't end like Dexter did though :
Man the ending was pretty crazy.What do you guys think it is?

Serious question: Is it the only show about this that close to reality?
Am I the only one on /g/ to cringe when he casually how he compromised Tor single-handedly? Or that he has all of Ron's files and emails despite stating in the previous sentence that Ron had over 100TBs of CP?And sure, everyone has access to Google's and Facebook's account management systems to bruteforce peoples' passwords. Are they trying? Yes. Are they trying hard enough to write a show primarily about a top-tier pentester/security engineer? Hell no.
You really fucking suck at listening.He said served 100TB of CP. Which means bandwidth. 100TB of bandwidth. That's not a lot considering they gave no time frame.He compromised Tor by owning the exit nodes, which is a very plausible attack. it's called the Sybil attack, Google it you mongol.
More like coder version of DexterTo make things worse, he called his folder a data graveyard or some shit. You'd have to be a fool not to notice the whole emotionally detached outsiderthing he's got going on, and how it's outrageously dexterish.
500m wide screens when?
You can very easily bruteforce Google and Facebook passwords if you have a big enough botnet.Which isn't that hard to archive, you can even rent it.
it would be more realistic if he made a python keylogger in 4 min and just put it on on the computers of that dude, and his psycho bitch, that IS easy and fast and he would just need to be in the same room as their computers, and he is
And sure, everyone has access to Google's and Facebook's account management systems to bruteforce peoples' passwords.It showed him using a combination of dictionary attacks and personal info to bruteforce passwords.Compared to the utter shite that comes out of programs like 24 or outright nerd blackface like TBBT, it's pretty good so far.
First of all, 3/10 for making me fact-checkWhat he said was I'm directly copypasting the subtitlesPolice? You want them to find outabout the 100 terabytes of child pornographyyou serve to your 400,000 users?Nowhere is he talking about bandwidth. Without context there is no reason to assume he's talking about bandwidth.He compromised Tor by owning the exit nodes, which is a very plausible attack. No it's not, you dumb motherfucker. Our good friend the NSA concluded just last year there is no plausible attack on Tor to commit TARGETED de-anonymization of users. You're so full of shit it pains me.
Is the second episode out? I saw some people post that they saw the first 2 episodes.
no, it's airing sunday , in few hours the torrent will be up
No it wouldn't. Believe me. A keylogger is detectable and why would he log out? Logging him out forcefully would raise suspiciusness.You are just thinking that you know something about it but you don't know shit.
What in the what? You need access to the hashes to bruteforce. You think those services allow you to retry typing your password several thousand times in a few minutes?it's pretty good so farif it's above writing VB GUIs to track IPs, it's all goodI think you're setting the bar too low.
swagThanks buddy. Now I wont be lonely and bored today, just lonely ;
What in the what? You need access to the hashes to bruteforce. You think those services allow you to retry typing your password several thousand times in a few minutes?You can just attack them from all the nodes from your botnet. Each node would try about 10 passwords and it'd be enough.
So psyched about this
I think you're setting the bar too low.Being a fictional television program, they need a little bit of freedom to stretch things. They deserve some small credit for actually bothering to show a unix shell instead of an excrutiatingly obvious MS Surface product placement.
He implied that Ron was hosting a hidden service, so owning exit nodes doesn't actually explain anything.
No it wouldn't. Believe me. A keylogger is detectable and why would he log out? Logging him out forcefully would raise suspiciusness.You are just thinking that you know something about it but you don't know shit.what? are you bloody retarded? you can literally put a usb in someone's computer for 10 sec just to install a python keylogger that will run in the background and send you keystrokes and screenshots over mail you set, it wouldn't show anywhere and unless they were suspicious  to look through the processes on their computers they couldn't see it. He just needs to get the password once you dumb fuck. I did this to my friend, although he went to get me a glass of water for a min or so. The guy that is fucking his waifu is a moron as the protagonist says, and psychologists don't know shit usually about computers, so he could have easily get those facebook acounts that way you dumb fucking cunt. Why is /g/ filled with kids who never even script kiddied let alone hacked anything?
You can just attack them from all the nodes from your botnet. Each node would try about 10 passwords and it'd be enough.In what universe isn't the account automatically locked after 100 cumulative failed tries, especially when they all occur within seconds?
to attract people, screenplay writers add quite flashy stuff that are near impossible most of the time. not just about hacking.it's like anime where high/middle schoolers save the world. many shows can be regarded as live action shonen thing.what if they went with full realism? no one would watch it and it would be boring.
He would leave himself recorded on the security cameras.Fair point, I'm also retarded.
what if they went with full realism? no one would watch it and it would be boring.Not really. I've seen real-life people make ATMs empty themselves and people single-handedly expose CIA flights, prisons and fronts.
Yes, and those presentations are already available on the internet.
I don't know how I feel about this.
I'm running Linux too
Hence there's no need to make stretch the truth. Crazy shit is possible as it is, no need to take the short bus and say he can crack Tor.
the end results are interesting but you have to tell a story, otherwise it would be a documentary. a nice documentary it might be but it's a different format than tv series.
But the people who want to watch those videos already will. It has to appeal to the general public too.The show is shit, I don't disagree. Its just not meant to service people like you.
Seeing that screen scratched that part of my mind that doesn't allow anything good to exist. Full stop.
I hope you all realize that this shot alone will bring a flood of newfags and redditors.
Meh, I'm not sure I agree they have to go full potato to appeal to the masses, but I have to go to bed. I have a meeting in 7 hours.
They renamed the boards so they won't know it's us.

if you worry about "newfags" or "redditors" coming to your sekrit hacking club, you are either one or both of those.personally I would appreciate new blood. /g/ is already "help me pick parts for my PeeCee" board so maybe they would help with actual discussion.
Fuck off.

are you trying to prove my point?
So what's shopping an global issues from?
nothing is going to compete with their catalog and sales.They'd have to fuck up far worse than anything they've ever done for it to matter at all.
Global issues could be /pol/, I have no clue what shopping could be.
as people have said, I'm on the fence toodon't get me wrong, from a /tv/ standpoint the acting is fucking atrocious, but they're trying hard to make it as real as possible when it comes to technology and I respect that, I'll watch one or two more episodesit will probably turn to shit eventually, I still haven't recovered from the strain
/fa/ maybe.
I can see that. It could also be /t/. Torrenting is kind of like shopping.
Shopping is clearly /g/.Every other thread here is "HELP ME PICK EXPENSIVE THING TO BUY"
it's very hard to like the main character, but the first episode pays a lot of fan service to shut-in tech kids who recognize terms like "ssh" and "wget" and they don't trip over themselves using these terms incorrectly, which is kind of pleasing. My intuition is that they'll eventually fuck it up, though, and when it has this awkwardly crazy, gimpy character and it comes off as a tech version of Dexter with no technical consistency and a meh story punched up by suits.
That actually exists though
The website is intereting. It says it is Debian, and logs the user in as root showing password dots, but I cannot get apt to work. Or uname, or man....
KDE tricked him into doing corporate dirty work.  Now he'll blackmail his buddy into doing even worse shit.
Those who keep saying "he's us" have to remember... He said he DIDN'T beat off to kids.   Nice try.
you get like five options, it's a faux terminal with dumbed down inputs for casuals.
you implement a complete shell for people to interact with over the web.
Quality post.
why not just make an ssh server?
well other than the leftist bullshit, it was not too bad. doubt that htey can keep up the production value of the first ep for every following ep though.
KDE confirmed choice of champions
Damn, the shills are in full force today. They arent even trying to hide it
I actually like the show, the first five minutes hooked me instantly
giving people unrestricted access to even a restricted user account? have you literally never worked in security?
Top kek
restricted access to a server used solely for marketing a show. there are plenty of wargames that do almost exactly this.
Yeah, like anyone's ever going to say that.
so someone will find an exploit and take the server over to operate as a Command and Control server, or to mine bitcoin, or to inject malware into the computers of anyone who happens upon the site.This is all insanely dangerous for no good reason. 90% of people who recognize a shell will be marginally disappointed that the shell is gimped. Maybe 10% will be seriously upset. On the flip side, exposing the server so dangerously would have only earned them the approval of maybe a handful of autists, and endangered every visitor.
so why hasn't the very same thing happened to sites like smash the stack? honestly dude i have to agree with the amount of people that would appreciate it but look who the show is marketed to, a handful of autists is their demographic. and now i'm getting captcha's and i cant be fucked clicking on bread for the sake of argument. have a nice day.
wait is that snafu
imploring 4chan isn't 99% newfags and redditors already
i'll watch this show solely because of my love for snafu
sorry, the europeans in their small pastural villages with quad gigabit fiber optic connections don't see this type of fancy digital electronic signage very much I'm guessing.
So if this motherfucker has debilitating social anxiety, how can he hook up with a qt grill drug dealer and fuck her?The show is still pretty cool, I'm excited to see where it goes. "Bon soir" guy seems like a fag.
IT'S GNU/LINUXNOT "LINUX"GODFUCKINGDAMNIT
Drugs help social anxiety. Fact.
hurr i'm so lonely I have social anxietyfucks a girl effortlessly then proceeds telling her to gtfoDropped.
Drugs help with social anxiety a lot.
It's not actually out yet. The first episode was thrown out there to gain interest. It starts up for real sometime in  June/July.
Why would the girl be even interested in the first place? That was totally unnecessary, why would you show the protagonist as a social loser and dramatize it to the point of showing him crying in corners then JUST AFTER it makes him have sex with 0 effort? Yes i mad
She's a massive slut.She even tried to give him the drugs for free in exchange for sex.It was cheap impersonal sex, it's certainly not going to make him feel any less lonely.
Why would she try that much to have sex with a loser instead of fucking the chad down the street? Again, unnecessary, just an attempt to normiefy the show.
Social anxiety stems from fear. Of course any drug that suppresses a flight response helps against social anxiety.
Fuck off back to your containment board, you incel.Most people don't take benign plot elements as an attack on their person.

also mike judge is too high-brow for most normies.tonights SV thread: /tv/57091023
It's a cyberpunk show.The setting is much more dystopian than real life.In this setting, literally one company owns everything and student loans of over $200,000 are commonplace.
that sounds a lot like oh wait...
That's funny.
This IS real life, except Google hasn't gotten to that point yet, but everything else is spot on.
It's been 4 years since that fucking movie released and people are still posting bane and cia.what a mess
it's actually 'Stuff We Says', think inner city ebonics. Check the screenshots if you don't believe me.

kek.
seems interesting so I start to watch non-technobabbleok*nixoksocially retardedokTAKE DOWN DEM CONGLOMERATES oh.. so this is just fight club with a 'hacker'Neat.
Fight Club + Hackers + Dexter.
I will only give it that it tries to be somewhat relate-able to modern computer society, but it tailors to much to stuff that is irrelevant. Faggots, drugs, relationships, that's all meaningless. Hate this simple society, so much.
I just like how they are scared to call the problem capitalism and instead just refer to it as a money problem.
I like it. I'm going to watch it. I like the character, I like the general vibe, and I like that they are at least making some effort at being realistic. I don't quite understand why they go as far as they do with the technological realistic-ness and don't go all the way, though. Like telling the guy that he was using "Tor networking" instead of just "using Tor", as any technologically literate person would have, and talking about an exit node in the context of what must have been a hidden service. They clearly have some kind of technology consultant maybe even a /g/entooman?, so how and why are these small things still allowed to happen? It was full of inaccuracies like that, but correcting them wouldn't have affected the story. So, why didn't they?They also said he was using Gnome, and then showed a desktop environment that clearly wasn't Gnome. I thought that the reason that media normally shows fake as hell looking computer interfaces was that there's some copyright problem involved with showing proprietary software interfaces. But that's not a problem with free software, right? Couldn't they have actually showed Gnome on the screen?
i want a show about a guy who never leaves his mom's basementYeah ok no thanks.
Does anybody else get the feeling that the KDE thing was intentionally cringey? Sort of a little inside joke to make elitists like /g/ cringe and hate the character?
Wasnt even promoting it, hate television and fictitious programming.
They're not that genius and don't have the time to do that kind of research.
Welcome to television, where are facts are flawed and add shit tons of meaningless bullshit.
 guy looks like a typical /g/ robot has sex to appeal to normie audienceInto the trash it goes.I kek'd at that.
they only skim the info before making a script, and DEs are apparently a big thing for the linux user base so they added this in. you don't expect the script authors to be experts in everything they write about, do you?
It's pretty good. They sure know how to pander to the paranoid anarchists.Respect for getting most of the tech details right while keeping it interesting, though.Solid 8/10, would pay to watch more.
Your autism is so bad that you didn't even realize I was making fun of you.
oh mon Dieu they literally made a show to appeal to the unadulterated asperger stereotypewhat is wrong with this worldthis. it's so unbelievable and unrealistic. this turbosperg motherfucker apparently has some cute normiefag girl that cares about him, yet he's some corporate cyber security edgelord...maybe moderately feasible lower down on the hierarchy, like in a sales position. I can't take shit like this seriously it just kills the whole show for me.
ITT: shills and autistsThis is the first time I've used the word shill and actually meant it in the literal sense.Good show though. Bad in a cringey way, but cringey in a can't not watch it way.
this. it's so unbelievable and unrealistic. this turbosperg motherfucker apparently has some cute normiefag girl that cares about him, yet he's some corporate cyber security edgelord...You're projecting, nerd.People can have childhood friends and work in security at the same time. Just because you're too much of an autist doesn't mean it's not realistic.Stop sperging out, it's of a fucking show. Entertainment.
he has friendshe has a jobSorry you can't relate.
i-is that 4chans?
I'm ashamed to say that show taught me something I didn't know. I didn't know what R U Dead Yet? was, turns out it's just slowloris with multipart form data.
That he is as autistic as he clearly is but somehow ended up befriending a girl who's supposed to be attractive is the problem. There is obviously a line of realism which can be crossed in entertainment but once it goes over and stays over towards a certain level then it just becomes fucking cheesy and unwatchable.
There was a 15s shot with 4chan on the screen, couldn't have been less subtle if they had tried to.The name of the threads on the homepage are fun too.
/wsg/647544what company is ecorp based on?
I know some attractive girls that take pity on autists like you. It disgusts me a little, but it's not all that uncommon, especially if they are childhood friends working at the same place.
None, or maybe a weird mix of MSFT and GOOG.They aren't afraid to take shots at big companies like Apple, but I think they just wanted to go with a stereotipical Evil World Company.
/g/ absolutely love gentoo
Get out with your forced "lol gen2" maymay, faggot.
You're fucking funny dude just keep hammering away at that little meme projection of yours it's really hurting my feelings not to mention making you seem like the powerful chad T. alphacock we all know you truly are
Sure, keep fighting the good fight, anon. I'm sure you'll get the show cancelled for having an attractive girl friend with a security guy, or whatever it is you're sperging about now.
lol k fag
This.It is more Dextery than fight club. May be he's just seeing Mr. Robot guy but he could be a real person working for that KED goy who's plan is to take Evil Corp by framing the old goy who got arrested by the FBI.I see no connection with fight club.
How can I buy the episodes directly from the creators, without giving money to a distribution platform?Also, when is episode 2 coming out?
le implying maymayNo one said capitalism was bad, but the USA is the most capitalist country in the world. You're an ignorant shitstain with no debate capabilities.hurr le america is communist"No, it's not fucktard"y u hate capitalism anyway
More like run by corporations and lobbies kek. You're actually living in a fascist state.economy ran by private entitiesfascismEnd yourself.
Maybe if I say something retarded they'll reply to me finally
taking the bait
You make something better.Also having all Ron's emails and sebt files is imo different than mirroring the CP collection
Snafu stop
fuck off cyrus
Or he could just take a hammer and beat the passwords out of them
All these 15 year olds calling themselves oldfags and whining about newfags...
I happen to be an expert on this subject. Lemme play devil's advocate for a moment.Am I the only one on /g/ to cringe when he casually how he compromised Tor single-handedly?From what I understood, he was serving CP from his cafe's gigabit connection. If he had his onion service on that LAN and the guy was capturing the traffic it's not very hard to spot the only computer serving 100TB worth of encrypted traffic and realise that's an onion service.The explanation about the exit node was sketchy at best, but it roughly makes sense. Or that he has all of Ron's files and emails despite stating in the previous sentence that Ron had over 100TBs of CP?Obviously, he had access to everything and only made a copy of the incriminating stuff. You see him burn CDs 700MB for every person he's incriminating, he obviously doesn't copy everything.And sure, everyone has access to Google's and Facebook's account management systems to bruteforce peoples' passwords.And that's where it falls appart a little, but it could make sense that he's slowly trying dict-generated passwords against the FB/Google API, you see him do some social engineering and the 10/s try rate is consistent.Are they trying? Yes. Are they trying hard enough to write a show primarily about a top-tier pentester/security engineer? Hell no.They are doing fairly well. Actually, they are the best attempt we've had ever, so fuck you.
I'm actually more excited to watch this shit show than any anime airing this season.
I like the show so far.Those who find scenes like "DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT" and other ill-fitting things such as the blasphemy of a hardcore hacker not using a mechanical keyboard need to understand something -- Every TV show revolving a certain profession has certain realism flaws. Detective shows, ER shows, shows about politics -- none of them are an exact 100% replica of real life.So take a chill pill and enjoy the story. It seems promising so far.
Same, the whole nouveau anonymous direction of occupy wall st/anti-capitalism annoys me, yet i'm still quite happy to sit through it.
Anarchists? Are you kidding? This show is anti-corporate and statist...
The common meaning of anarchist is "angry teenager that hates society".
i liked it.i was a little disappointed by the software / abstract money against hardware / gold standard analogy.  he swallowed that too easily.i liked that he was so clearly hacked by mr robot, but maybe that was too easy.
That's because uneducated anarchists are usually just teenagers looking for something to break.The show disappointed me on that sense, I was hoping for an anarchist story, but then, I get this commie bullshit.
There are no educated anarchists.Anyone educated that isn't just kidding around would realize that the name is forever tainted and call themselves something else.
It's how much of an arrogant moron blackberry guy was that made him do the deed. The MC always hated Evil corp so it's not like he needed much reasoning from MR robot.
Like Liberterian?Because they're basically the same thing.
That's just false.more about anarchism, it's a lot more than you think. Chomsky for example is an anarquist syndicalist
you're right, i was nitpicking.but we don't know yet which side is mr robot really on...
noam chomsky is an anarchist that means you can be not stupid and anarchist at the same time please believe me guysAnarchism is devolved thinking. The world needs order to function. People only ever deny that fact because they take it for granted. Hence.. are idiots.
Fuck you, shill. Go on /v/ to boast how big of a haxxx0r you are.
I don't like something therefore everyone must agree with meThis isn't a fucking hugbox.If you don't realize how retarded you are right now, you're hopeless.
Dude's just saying that the show is close enough for a TV show, how is he "shilling" anything? You want real hacking, go hack for real, don't watch TV shows. What the fuck do you expect and more importantly, why do you expect it?
Not that anon but it's just really lame that hollywood or whoever the fuck is exploiting this role and set of ideas to make some half-assed show.The whole thing has a stilted vibe to it. Some things just aren't right. For instance the deadness in the therapist's eyes. That's the actor herself. You're never supposed to break the 4th wall like that passively, because that's exactly what being objectively bad is.And why the fuck did they literally repeat dialogue? Like the 'come on, come on come on' when he's staving off the server attack, and the 'it's happening it's happening it's happening' at the end.It reminds me of lecturers who put laugh tracks on the recordings of their lectures. It's just fucking off and downright creepy. That uncanny valley type of vibe.
anarchism = identifying organizations having authority, ask them to justify their actions and if they are unable to do so try to supersede them. That doesn't sound silly to me. The whole fight club let's crash the banks and go back to the gold standard is pretty silly though.
I saw a thread on reddit about how inacurate the show was and how the MC was "everything that people from 4chan wanted to be."I liked the show and I hope these pretentious liberal little shits wouldl shut the fuck up.
redditGet the fuck out.

How do I make it go away?!
install gentoo
Is there a way to make it go away other than installing Gentoo?
this tbh
Stop shitting /g/ up with this gash, Jesus Christ the same thread has been made like seven times this morning you fat shit.
ther is an application for that i think its start begone or something like this. just use googel

how do I cure autism
install arch
just uninstall the KB3035583 update
This. Literally as simple as that. Just done it myself.
install Gentoothis was a lieGentoo is for pervertsinstall Ubuntu/Xubuntu/whatever
tfw I never install Windows updates and don't have this
not hard
install templeOS
That doesn't uninstall it dumbshit.
Why would you uninstall it you dumbshit, it preloads W10 and you'll get it at the end of July
did you get 10 cents for this post or 5?
Do you understand the concept of system security and deprecation?W7 doesn't get updated anymore after July 29th.asks for help on a GNU/Linux boardcan't even configure his shitty system properlyDo whatever you want anyway, fucking wintard.
Go to control panel, search notifications, and disable it.

turn down your resolution, that icon looks horrendous. means your resolution is too high.

You either embrace it or install gentoo.
asks for help on a GNU/Linux boardWhy is it so typical of freetards to change definitions and renaming shit that's not theirs ?
Android MApparently you get to choose to activate permissions when the app requests it, instead of approving all permissions when you first install.  Also supposed improvements in battery life.Thoughts?  Pic related, picture taken from Anandtech's Android M preview.  Apparently the writer is a weaboo like /g/entoomen

Wow, that's something that iOS has been doig for ages already.
 inb4 some people are still waiting to get the lollipop update.
Are there any design changes?
You mean what iOS, CyanogenMod and every custom ROM that respects itself have been doing for ages?How else are stock ROMs lagging behind the rest of the world?
I was looking into this because of botnet implications etc, I don't have M installed so I don't have any experience but from what I could gather it goes something like this: you allow or deny permission groups, but the groups are pretty open ended, so lowest level permissions covers stuff like internet access, so no luck stopping phone home apps. Also any apps installed with the system take all the permissions listed in the manifest, so google still has free reign over your device.
Because Google doesn't give a shit about your privacy.
No, this year is about refining and improving the experience.
If you're that worried, get a cheap phone, put CM without Google apps. Problem solved.
Privacy is not yours anymore. Having a private life is a vestigial artifact that will be severed from our consciousness in one generation's time.
Privacy is not yours anymore.severed from our consciousness in one generation's timeSo is it gone now or in one generation's time? Dumbass.
You can allow it deny specific things
implying CyanogenMod isn't Samsung botnet There's no place to run
It's gone now. All you have is the notion of it.
wat
It is already gone. When I asked my mother about this she said she wouldn't even care if drones were to search through the house since she has nothing to hide.It's really scary.
It's gone now. All you have is the notion of it.If it's gone now,  how can I have the notion of it?
Because the generation previous had it and you think you still do. Like the gold standard and happy marriages.
happy marriagesnever have existed, not at scale.

No
Will M still have lollipops disgustingly huge icons and solid white backgrounds?That was my only gripe.What's the coolest nova theme?
Well, there's this at least.
permissionsBut I've been soing this since about 3 years on androidAlso supposed improvements in battery life.This is how they get you to beta test their horseshit. it was the only reason I upgraded to lollipop currently on kitkat. Don't do it unless you have a widespread and popular concensus regarding this.
What does "automatic" do?
It will change at a set time, night mode
pretty neat tbh
TRDS does it like that currently, but TRDS is nowhere near good enoughOnly a few menus themed, it's not fully system wide
i hope that i will be able to make apps unable to check the app store for licenses so pirating apps will get easier
Fucking this.It's open source, you can read the fucking code yourself before you install it, so anyone who thinks it's a botnet is proper tin foil hat wearing clinically insane.
FARIS TAN!!!!!
look up lucky patcherthe newest version allows you to patch your google play to not check for licenses.
How good is it compared to Freedom?
This is lollipop and not M
What exactly does this mean? Every time an app tries to do something with permissions it will prompt you about it? It's there an option to just give the app the permissions it needs right away?Seems horribly inconvenient for apps that you trust. If I download an app that I'm fairly certain isn't doing anything shady, then I have to manually allow it to do certain things, that just seems silly. Or am I misunderstanding what this does or the significance of it?
*tips fedora*
download App XApp X has a camera function you want to use"Is App X allowed to use the camera?"yes pleasepress "allow"it will never ask you about using the camera againyou try another feature and App X wants to use your location for stuff"Can App X use your location data?"no thanks, I don't want the botnet knowing my locationpress "do not allow"it will never ask you for your location againThis, instead of going to App Ops/Security and manually going through every app and disabling the permissions you don't want.

friendly reminder that you missed the bitcoin boat
But I caught the Dogecoin one.Made a good $500.
tfw lost a wallet with 7BTC in it that wasn't even worth $50 at the time
at least i got dogerich
I recall the moment I decided not to buy at 12 cents because I thought they were over valued...
I mined buttcoins and used mtgox but didn't cash out before they get "hacked" aka stole all our moneymtgox owes me around $10kbut then again, I mined them all with my mind-range graphics card back before bitcoin became popular, so I can't really complainpeople who actually "invested" in it buying rather than mining were fucking idiots though
having a botnet around that time could have been the biggest risk:reward of all time in that period
tfw I could have cashed out my PND for £500tfw I held on to it
I didn't miss it, I misused it.I sold 1000 bitcoins at $5 and use it to buy a $5000 motorcycle, crashed it 2 months later losing my virginity to a 16yo 4channer.Meanwhile my boss I showed at $0.40 went all-in and became a millionaire, then sold the business I worked at and the business died so I lost my job.
tfw ur brand new gtx560i architecture didn't efficiently mine btcwasn't cost effective at the current price, so didn't botherprice goes up by multiple factorsnvidia fuck off
i warned u about 4chan bro
I still have like 15 bitcoins from ancient time is this a lot?
Is ~$3500 a lot to you?
i even missed the dogecoin boat.
The "people" on this website are fucking inbred retards.You should know this by now.
Mining btc around 560 era was a dead end unless you had an amd card and very cheap electric, mining was only worth it before FPGAs came out, then with FPGAs for a while, then for a while again with ASICSSure, you could mine at other times but the time:profit ratio and the investment for the initial mining rig in btc directly was a a lot better
tfw I purchased and spent hundreds of bitcoins at under 10 dollars each
what the fuck is a "bitcoin" anywayhow do you "mine" digital moneylike how does it just generate out of nothing
Bought at $30. Sold at $750. New MBA and car. I did good for my self.
Ahorita no joven.
missedMined 4, used to buy $1800 worth of PC hardwarehardly missed, just late, still made coin
I missed the Bitcoin boat but I was able to snag a Radeon 7950 for $150 before they jacked up the price to $300+ after the Bitcoin craze.
You trick a lot of people into thinking your magical computer numbers are very valuable, then they spend real money buying your numbers and you get rich.
its somethink to do about compuiters lolzhow cares i herd you cant plat viudya gaems if you are a miner rofel

I missed it because it was my stupid decision. I could have bought 20 bitcoins when they were $50 and sell them for a fuckhueg profit, but I was a faggot and didn't believe bitcoin would ever become popular.
tfw you will never set up a deep web drug market and get sentenced to life in prison for it

Why don't people go for the 295x2 over the 980 TI ? The 295x2 is 15-30% more powerful than 98 ti and its usually a little bit cheaper these days. Is dual gpu really that bad? Do a lot of games not support dual gpu ?
Because of the failure rates. There's a massive amount of people with the R9 garbage that have issues. Artifacts. Blackscreens. BSoD's.
AMD HOUSEFIRES 500Wany year
I wondered the exact same thing, and I'm not even some AMD fanboy or anything.I think it has to do with marketing and the AMD cards being a tad old while the 980TI is brand new.I mean I was at some gaymer who lives in his parents shack last weeknot a direct friend of mine and it surprised me he exclusively has the newest Intel, Nvidia and Razr shit.
AMD, good for burning your house down
Because it's a two card GPU. Look at the frame times.If you don't know what a frame time is kill yourself.
It Cant be 700 watts now
-500W-Xfire/SLI profiles have to come out before you can take advantage of the power-Still only has 4GB so for 4k the ram usage is already at limit-Some will find having to find space for the AIO cooler awkwardPlus if the new HBM card lands with only 4GB they've shot themselves in the foot with that.
Most people don't want the drawbacks of having 2 GPUs inside of their system.Increased power consumptionIncreased heat outputOptimization issues in applications that don't support dual GPUsI would rather choose the 980Ti than the 295x2 unless I'm doing something like 4k gaming in non Nvidia optimized titles.
Dual GPU. I prefer single GPU cards. The 295x2 has to use crossfire profiles I think. It's not that I specifically don't want Crossfire over SLI or something, I don't want to deal with either.
You're a fucking retard
295x2 is better on paper but not better in real world scenarios.
Dual gpu cards have never sold as well as single gpu cards
no driver
While I'd definitely are the case for AMD single cards and even some GPUs, their dual card GPUs are just a disaster and not a good idea, what with the ridiculous power draw, huge space requirement and the frankly unimpressive gains and difficulties caused.Go with the standard R9 280-295, they're all you need.
hello /g/, which smartphone would you recommend that is the best bang for the buck? I dont want anything overkill, i was thinking galaxy note 3, htc one m8, lg g3.
How are those not overkill they are hundreds of dollars
Best bang for the buck is LG L40, beautiful little kitkat gem of a phone at a cost of approx 0.1 flagship phone.
How's the new ASUS phone?
LG G2
It's actually really nice, I'm impressed with it so far.  Definitely the best bang for your buck.
Really thinking about pulling the trigger. Dunno if I should just save the $20 and get the Moto G though.
Z3C, god-teir battery life If you're not on Lollipop.
Bump
Yeah, the Xperia Z3C would be really nice, but the Z3 is cheaper at most places and he doesn't seem bothered by larger sizes.
LG G3 with zero lemon 9k battery and 128gb sd card. Win. I charge my phone once every 3 days.
Zenfone 2 4gb ram is the best bang for your buck.
Not really, the 2gb version seems like a better deal for the average user
OK you're probably right.4GB is more for power users.
LG G2/thread
Oneplus one. Their profit margin is like 5 percent if even that. /thread
any case suggestions for the g2?
smoking
If you value your human rights, Blackphone.
LG G2.  Great phone, extremely active rom development, and most places it's $140
I've had my G3 for a month now and I'm very happy with it, runs smoothly, the original battery lasts long enough compared to my old HTC One X, and with the SD slot it's got plenty of storage space. Was totally worth the $50 I paid for it.
what ROM are you running? I need to change mine cos it keeps crashing but i have entire archives of work/personal messages and i can't be bothered. felt the G4 yesterday and it was glorious.However, I think I'm going for the Nexus line from now on for best software
Alcatel Idol 3. Best bang for the buck, and best looking new phone.
tfw just preordered an LGG4tfw Im getting it round June 5th instead of waiting half a month for my contract to endtfw I also get a free $100 gift card to best buyBASED BEST BUY
Spigen SlimArmor. You can find them on eBay for cheap nowadays, damned fine case overall just that niggling issue of the antenna cutout on one corner, however.
i'll check that out, thanks.
$23 a good price?
A bit steep in price, if that's USD. Also be aware that Spigen cases get counterfeited with extreme frequency so, there's always a chance it'll be a fake. Most times it won't matter but some fakes just don't fit the phone properly. Also, if you have a Verizon variant of the G2 it's thicker front to back because of the wireless charging hardware in the back cover and the other cases won't fit it, and vice versa.The Verizon model is the only one with wireless charging support by default, as well. But it's factory unlocked for GSM operation anywhere so just toss a SIM card in it and go, no unlock code needed.But $10-18 USD is better for the SlimArmor pricing, can't speak for other currency exchange rates.
mines an unlocked at&t.the only ones i see on ebay are from either the uk for $24 or $9 from israel.
would you recommend that is the best bang for the buck?I told this to your mom and she said 'she is the best BANG for my buck'
nex 5. Mine is one and a half years and still perfectly good
I'd get the G2.I have a G3 and I replaced it with the Moto X. The G3 is a great phone, but unless you root it, the software is a little autistic. It's not as bad as touchjizz, but LG's skin is just bad. If you root you, then you'll have no regrets. Great display, very fast, great specs, great camera. If you don't, then you'll probably still like it, but you'll have occasional problems here and there. Aside from the software, the battery is also not that great either, especially with the screen on the G3. I could only use my G3 for 3-4 hours of use before it needed charging.
spending hundreds of dollars on a shiny new phonegood goy
im looking to get the s6I dont give a shit abou tnot being able to replace my battery or add additional storage. Im coming from a nexus 5 so it never bothered me anyway.Why shouldnt I get the s6?
Where would it be $140?
fuck, can't find a spigen at a decent price. guess i'll just go for the incipio or something.
Do all wireless chargers charge at the same speed or are some more powerful than others?
Seriously this if you can find one its what I have its an awesome phone.The trouble with LG lately is that they have gone too "innovative" The lg3/4 have half the battery life of the g2 because of their ridiculous resolution.
Zenfone 2 beats OPO in  basically every way.
Buying quality doesnt make you a goy,it makes you smart.fucking /g/
Im getting a Galaxy Note 4, just about the best phone possible with verizon.
I definitely recommend the G3. Best phone I've ever owned. I'd go with the G2 if I were on a budget though.
moto G has no lte. and you can get the 16gb version on b&h for 199 tax free. and free shipping.
I really dig the Note 4, but the speaker on the back instead of the bottom like the Note 3 was a fucking stupid move. I don't like white phones too prone to stains, dirt and wear and the black version of the Note 4 looks like a retro 80's VCR on the front. Should've stuck with the brushed metal/graphite texture from the 3.
LG G3 is free and comes with a free tablet if you get it with a 2 year contract at Verizon
Sony Z2Superior to g3, and z3.Cheaperit was half year ago
xperia Z3v
$140
dont listen op buying a phone older than 2 years is dumbmoto g was and is an awful phonethe g3 is good but for the current price/competitor range it would be a bad decisionnot when the 1p2 is so close. the screen is shit alsoS gel case. 3 dollars with postage, stylish and the most protective case I've ever seenbecause its boring and for the same price you can get much better phonestechnically yes. youd be hard pressed noticing the difference. if you do notice, it is brokenhave had the white one for ages. Back looks as good as the day I bought it
expensive, shit screen
Huawei g620sCheaper and perhaps negligibly better than the moto g 4g 2nd Ed.
Tldr fag
Agreed, ROMs are great, phone is great, battery is great, screen is great, camera is great, cases are great, everything is fucking great and it's cheap as fuck.
I just bought an Xperia Z3 Compact. I used the phone for a moment before noticing that the instructions booklet actually said that it needs a first charge, 30 minutes minimum. lelSo i charged it to 100. Probably didn't have much effect, or what do ya think? Just used 5% of battery after a while of fidgeting around

class="quote" Returns a list that is the concatenation of lists. If no lists are supplied, nconc returns nil. nconc is defined using the following recursive relationship: nconc =  nconc nil . lists == nconc . lists nconc list = list nconc list-1 list-2 == progn rplacd last list-1 list-2 list-1 nconc list-1 list-2 . lists == nconc nconc list-1 list-2 . lists
class="quote" append returns a new list that is the concatenation of the copies. lists are left unchanged; the list structure of each of lists except the last is copied. The last argument is not copied; it becomes the cdr of the final dotted pair of the concatenation of the preceding lists, or is returned directly if there are no preceding non-empty lists. append 'a b c 'd e f ' 'g = A B C D E F G append 'a b c 'd = A B C .

Out of curiosity, why not Racket? I'm a beginning Common Lisper with little experience in either
Racket forces you to use classes to do anything serious, and it does it in the worst possible way, by introducing new syntax punctuation [ and ] which thows the entire concept of homoiconicity out the window.Chicken just gives me functions from C libraries and lets me do what I want with them.
Not that classes and oop can't be great in small doses when done well I just don't like being forced to use them to do simple things like opening graphicsIf I was ok with oop being forced everywhere, I'd use Kawa
by introducing new syntax punctuation [ and ] which thows the entire concept of homoiconicity out the window.What are you talking about? [ and ] are synonyms for  and  and even { and }. You can use them interchangeably throughout you program so long as they properly match.
you can use them interchangeablydisgustingThat makes me like racket even less
I thought that  interchangeability was part of the Scheme standard.
this.And where does it states that you're forced to use classes?or give examples
that completely takes away the homoiconicity of lisp, I would never use anything but parens in any lisp codeThe gui module is completely dependent on oopgtk is not
No. It doesn't. Do you even know what homoiconicity means?
The homoiconicity is one syntax for everythingparens and s-expressions for functions, conditions, lists, everything
homoiconicity in this context means the same list structure for code and data. Even though you have [] and {} in the language it all means the same, you can still treat the source code as a list
Homoiconicity is not dependent on parentheses. You can have homoiconicity with curly brackets, brackets, or even angle brackets, etc.
Still looks ugly as fuck if they're intermixed
see
I would never use anything but parens in any lisp codeThen don't, but people are going to call you out on your shit if there's a style guide that says to use brackets.
I disagree.  It provides visual distinction to certain areas of code, and makes things more readable.
I agree with this. There's nothing philosophically wrong with a Lisp that behaves this way.
Going out the way of the thread a little bit to address the title.What's going on mister? Are you tired of Lisp or just the /g/ space dedicated to it?
I think they've gotten tired of making new threads. They've been really slow and dying quickly lately. : Let's get some action in here guys.
I can't believe that you are ditching a well documented language with one of the best communities just because a syntax issue that's completely optional. Who gives a damn if people call you out for not using brackets?
I was actually tired when I made the thread.   is also right, however.I'm getting sick of /g/.  I've largely stopped browsing many threads here asides from this one.  I'm glad the general on Lainchan has started picking up some.Just look at the catalog here.  It's saddening for anyone actually interested in technology to see good threads with so little replies, yet see that bait, consumerism, opinion-listing, and shitposting threads are usually successful and hit the bump limit.
It's not just that, I don't like that they force you to use classes to use a lot of their modules
Yeah I've been browsing lainchan a lot more lately as well. I wish they had a bit more traffic overall but then again it is a good way of keeping out the "muh gpu" morons. Thanks for keeping up the generals here : Your work is duly appreciated.
yeah thanks for making these threads, I've been posting on the lainchan thread too.It's been a few months since I last posted here, but I remember back then the lisp threads used to have a lot more people.I don't know if those people have gone away, the fact that may is a horrible month because a lot of students have finals me included or both.
As I said one or two threads before, we should casually mention the lainchan thread here and there or even in the pastebin so people can gradually move towards that.
incf this
There should be better ways out there to help the Lisp community. Maybe 4chan is just not the place to do this.There should be a good balance between a well-sized group and still be underdogs, because everything that grows enough tends to get bastardized.
the main problem with the /g/ lisp threads is they keep dropping off the board after about 10 or 15 posts so there is no way to carry on serious discussians. I am going to start spending more time on the lainchan lisp threadIm not sure if you are aware, but this clojurians thing is a private live chat for clojure

Forgot the quote.
Is Racket GUI Documentation gtk, qt4 or independent?
Best scheme/lisp to use?Looking for something with lots of batteries that respects my freedoms.
that respects my freedoms.by your freedoms you are of course referring to the the freedom that Richard Stallman gives you. I think we should be clear, there are many kinds of freedoms, but the freedom you enjoy is that of Richard Stallman
The API they provide is platform independent. The implementations try to use native widgets. On *nix, I think they're using GTK.
Racket sounds like it fits the bill.
 lots of batteriesRacket.
The only time I've had to use classes in Racket was when I had to do GUI programming. I'm not even sure what a class-free GUI lib would look like.
Be extremely careful when Jews try to define your morals. They've done so much damage to humanity this way. They take your natural desire to do right and twist it.
Although GTK is implemented in C, it has an object system. 
 go to lainchan no nsfw boards drugs boardI simply can't take that site seriously.
And you can take 4chan seriously? Any other *chan is better.
4chan did something right. This is one of the few places on the Internet where jews and their lies get btfo frequently and repeatedly every single day.

where jews and their lies get btfojewsbtfoOh look, an actual child.
I hate jews as much as the next person, but you really do sound like a child.This entire site is shit and it feels like it's moving towards its last leg.
that's cool, Clojurescript and Om are pretty nice.Here's a pixel editor with full redo also written in Clojurescript + Om
/l/ and /cl/ are both super secret boards.
I thought /cl/ meant common-lisp, I was pleasantly surprised
Why don't you leave?
This isn't the place for that.  I know.  I shouldn't have said anything.
M-x bump
how childish not to respect the freedoms given to you by the jew Richard Stallman. thank god we have a sticky on /g/ of rms as jesus christ, Im so glad that the majority of /g/ protects the freedom giving jew Richard Stallman
John McCarthy was also jewish.I'm  and meant religious jews.I shouldn't have said anything.  I'm sorry.  Let's just stop talking about this.

what editor are you guys using?I'm currently using sublime + sublimeREPL but I feel that I'm not using lisp to it's fullest potential - mainly I have a lot of functions that I can't evaluate on the repl because they depend on external libraries this is clojure btw.I tried LightTable and the Cursive plugin for Intellij but found them a bit clunkyI know that Emacs is certainly the way to go, but I haven't used it before so it's a bit intimidating to learn
I know that Emacs is certainly the way to go, but I haven't used it before so it's a bit intimidating to learnWell, the thing about Emacs is that it has a different paradigm from most editors... But it actually teaches you how to use it if you ask it.It has a built-in tutorial to get started, and after going through that, "C-h ?" [Control] + [H], [?] gives you a list of all of this things you can get help about.For example, at any point you can type "C-h m" to get a description of all of the modes enabled, including the keybindings to use the functionality."C-h k" followed by any key sequence will show the documentation for any key combo that does something.Another fun one is "C-h i", which pulls up the Info pages for your system... In there, there are entire books about how to use Emacs, all nicely organized if you want to learn about Emacs and ELISP. There are the "Emacs Manual", "Emacs FAQ", "ELISP" reference, and "ELIPS Intro".If you aren't sure what you are looking for, you can type "C-h a" and search the documentation for something in specific.If you want to search the manuals, "M-x info-apropos" [Alt] + [X], "info-apropos" allows you to do that.On top of that, pretty much everything has tab completion.
I'm using Emacs with SLIME for CL. I've been using it for around a year now, but I've not really read many tutorials and my .emacs is mostly a mashing-together of various things from the wiki. install emacs; spend a week dicking around with your setup; then enjoy the productivity increases. It's also a lot of fun. I've heard Clojure support is pretty dank/10.
I know that Emacs is certainly the way to go, but I haven't used it before so it's a bit intimidating to learnthe rule of thumb in programming is never memorize anything, just start using emacs like a regular editor with the toolbar and menubar. Trying to use cursor movement shortcuts will actually slow you down as a beginner as they dont have a speed increasing effect until you are moving through very large projectsthis is a really good emacs preset for clojureinstructions for installing it are part of a free online book on clojure programming

I just saw that post.That is pretty cute.
What post?
Wouldn't it repeatedly print "Not 420 yet" at the terminal? That seems kind of annoying.
Yeah it was mostly for diagnostics when writing it, you can just rip out that entire  print "Not 420 yet". sexp

my fedora has been exposed
Sounds good, thanks for sharing. I didn't know about chirp either.
that tweets 420 in bases 2-36 every day at 4:20It was exposed all along.
Yeah, it's surprisingly well designed. Most of the libraries I found at first were poorly documented if at all and really dated in their API support.
*cough*feel your pain.
Cool.  Are you the guy I helped in the Lainchan thread?
Yeah. Thank you again. Oddly enough this wasn't my intended application when I asked that.
You're welcome.  I'm glad to see you doing something interesting so early.Here's a better format form that you can use:format nil "~d: ~:*~vr" base 420* lets you skip or return to previous Format arguments or even go to absolute arguments from the first.I should really start working on some things I have planned.  There are a few website APIs that I want to make accessible from Common Lisp.As it stands, most Common Lisp I work with is helping people in these threads when they have questions.
Crazy. How long have you been writing Lisp?
I've only been writing Lisp for a few years.I don't have too much to show for it.  I usually just read about Lisp and help people here or participate in the little challenges thrown around in various threads.
I'm not even sure what a class-free GUI lib would look like.Any C GUI library
I've heard Clojure support is pretty dank/10Yeah, I've been reading pretty cool things, that's why I was looking into itThanks for the links! - and yeah agree on the not memorizing anything - that's how I got started with vim, just start to use it and learn new things out of necessity.I've saved that tutorial and will read it as soon as I have some free time - btw anyone have any experience with spacemacs?

What kind of environment do you use in your computers?
I use GNU Emacs with Slime.  StumpWM is my window manager.  I'm going to read the GNU GSD handbook and switch all of my systems over to that soon.I've been curious about Climacs, but I haven't gotten around to checking it out yet. Emacs Lisp doesn't compare to Common Lisp and reimplementing things like EMMS would give me something to do.
for those of you with Lisp Machine's keyboard fetish 
Where can I get my hands on one of these
when you install climacs with quicklisp, is it possible to startup climacs on its own without going using a lisp repl? where would the climacs executable be located?
Nice. We have similar environments.
Why is it that when I reach with the cursor any of the edges it show that ugly X that indicates there's no window there? How could I fix it?
I guess that is neat.Elaborate please.
I always work fullscreen and without a mode-line, whenever I go to the edges it turns the cursor into a big X that shows there's no Xorg elements there. Also, whenever I show the window info, it always shows a size of 1022x598 on a 1024x600 screen. I don't know if both issues are related.
I usually use fullscreen and I haven't added a modeline yet either.I'm not seeing this X, but I think I remember it.Also, whenever I show the window info, it always shows a size of 1022x598 on a 1024x600 screen. I don't know if both issues are related.I don't think I've ever had this happen.Try reading the manual if you haven't already.  I've been meaning to do that and dig through the source, but I haven't started yet.
Try reading the manual if you haven't already. I've been meaning to do that and dig through the source, but I haven't started yet.I'll check on that, thanks. Running fullscreen does eliminate the problem.Is there a way to make everything start automatically on fullscreen?
so I'm trying to go through realm of racket and I can't compile the first game. help
Is there a way to make everything start automatically on fullscreen?A window always takes up the entire space in a new group.
Yes, but that's when the 1022x598 problem comes up.
When you say the window info comes up at that resolution, which command are you running?  Which keypresses?
prefix + i
Huh.  Here's how it comes up for me.How did you install your StumpWM?  I compiled mine myself with SBCL.You're saying that window takes up the entire screen?
Yup, they take the whole screen but they leave a one pixel of separation. That's why it's always the resolution minus 2, emacs shows to be even smaller at 1017x594. Xfce terminal shows 1018x594. It's different each application. That's not much of a problem but I don't get why the X.
That's weird.  I can't really help you out here.  I think there may be a StumpWM IRC.  You may want to check there.

Do you use Emacs or a different lisp-based editor?THERE ARE DIFFERENT LISP-BASED EDITORS?If yes I need to know!
There's Guilemacs and Climacs, to name two.
Don't compile it, just interpret it. $ racket guess.rkt
i wonder does GuileEmacs removes all the C code from emacs?
I don'd know Racket, but in Clojure you have to define a function before using it - you are calling guess on start before you define it - try putting it on top of start
I wouldn't think there's much C, if any, in Guilemacs that isn't just a part of Guile itself.
In Racket you can something function that's defined later in the file so long as it isn't called in the code before it's actually been defined.
there are a bajillion emacs-like editors out there
To expand on what  said in case anyone is curious:In Racket, all top-level names are in scope at any point in the file. Since function bodies aren't evaluated until they are called e.g. You can test for exceptions by giving Rackunit a no-argument thunk function which does something which throws one, one can reference a function anywhere in the file, defined before or after the current function. When one evaluates a function, however, each non-local binding in the function body must reference a function definition which has been evaluated i.e. The name is bound to either a function or a top-level variable. This distinction may seem confusing in terms of function definitions, but it makes much more sense if one also considers a sequence such as ;; Purposely choosing an identifier from racket/basedefine - 2define foo + - bdefine b + - 1Now, when foo is defined, it is given bindings to the top-level - and b, but b has yet to be defined. If, conversely, all top-level bindings were done in parallel, then we would have a shaky logic: should b's - binding reference the default value or its shadowed one? There's argument for or against it. By making the definition forms sequentially evaluated, though, it leads to a much more reasonable program. In case anyone was wondering.
If you find out how to solve your problem, please report back with the solution. I'm going to go through all of the threads and compile a guide from it at some point.I think it has yo do with the application rendering but I think I'll dig deeper.
How do you define mutually recursive functions then? This sounds like a pain in general.

The difference is that Racket isn't a pile of shit.
Some applications only resize in steps of the width of a character column e.g. terminals, EmacsIf the application can't totally fill the width of your screen minus two pixels, it'll fill as many as it can, then fill in the surrounding region with the border.
VimSeparate terminal window for manual evaluationThis is suffering.

It replaces the previous Elisp compiler/interpreter written in C with a front end to Guile's compiler/VM, which is written in C.

SBCL 1.2.12 released:

Hello /lisp/The metasploit framework has a little tool called pattern_create.rb that generates a string of a specified number of bytes out of upper-case, lower-case, and numeral characters that can help you pinpoint the exact offset for overwriting the EIP or really any register in a buffer overflow exploit. How would you implement this in Lisp?
How would you implement this in Lisp?Are you asking how you would implement a buffer overflow attack in Lisp?You would have to find a flaw in the implementation you're targeting.  Common Lisp programs check buffer boundaries, unlike C, so this may be practically impossible, unless you optimize safety checks out with an implementation that will let you.One of the best ways to eliminate vulnerabilities is to make them impossible.  The only reason C is plagued by these problems is because of how little the standard actually specifies, making it ridiculously easy to invoke undefined behavior.
No. I was wondering how you'd recreate this little tool. Where pattern_create.rb 100 would return: "Aa0AAa1Aa2A" and so on couldn't paste it here; 4chan thought it was spam
does using emacs change anything?
Oh okay.In that case, I don't know enough to help you.  Sorry about that.
No problem :
Yes. Use Geiser. 
do people use emacs outside the terminal?
I use GUI emacs but I'm on OS X so it makes a bit more sense.
The gui is a bit more useful, but you don't have to.
I use Emacs with X because it's much more useful and featureful.  I can display images and pdfs, resize text, the border in the margins is much nicer to look at, among other things.I also don't feel like configuring st to work correctly with backspace right now.  It always registers as C-h in some programs, like Emacs and ed, but GNU Readline handles it correctly.
w8 you actually use st?why?
I do, because I'm always reading a PDF of some sort along Emacs.
I found it while looking through cliki.I've tried terminator, urxvt, xterm, and some others.  They're not at all pleasant to use.  My terminal emulator doesn't need a scrollbar, complex dropdown configuration menus, or any of that crap.Surprisingly, st is nice to use, asides from the backspace issue, which doesn't affect me all that much.  It's not at all complicated and the source is also pleasant to read.  I usually don't use Suckless software, but st is the best terminal emulator I've found.  I don't really need to do too much with a terminal nowadays though.The only other terminals I use are eshell and StumpWM's exec.What's your experience with that?  It's always usually too slow for me.  A majority of pdfs I read are hundreds of pages and I haven't found a way to get it usable yet.
I'm reading Land of Lisp in Emacs right now with doc-view-mode just discovered through this thread I can do that and the speed is no problem. The PDF is ~500 pages long.
What's your experience with that? It's always usually too slow for me. A majority of pdfs I read are hundreds of pages and I haven't found a way to get it usable yet.No problems just yet, I'm using an Atom and 2GB of RAM so, that says something.
I just opened a ~300 page pdf and it's frozen my Emacs right now.I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
i just looked at the atom github. it's written in coffee? and commit messages contain emoji's?I'm skeptical
he's talking about the atom cpu
oI use mupdf btw. I don't know anything about emacs though
While we're on it though, you're right to be skeptical. It's easily one of the worst editors I've ever used. I had a really big disassembly file that it just straight up refused to open because the file size was "over the limit." Hipster garbage goes into the trash where it belongs.
I left to go do something and it was still frozen when I came back.  Eventually it unfroze and worked fine.  I think I'll just look into some different pdf readers and avoid using Emacs for this right now.
So if I want to start using emacs without my vim handicap should i use spacemacs or evil?
Definitely evil.
ok thanks
Spacemacs is actually pretty incredible. I just installed it. Though it may be a bit overwhelming at first if you're new to emacs. Just go with Evil for now.
Speaking of ide's, can I just use eclipse+dandelion so I don't have to fuck around with emacs? Tried setting up emacs today, seems like a pain in the dick to install and more-so to use.
not wanting to fuck around with emacswanting to fuck around with eclipseIf you really want an IDE use something designed for it like LispWorks, etc.
Would I just be better off writing lisp files in notepad++? I ain't so smart and getting slime working with emacs hasn't been working.
Why does Lisp have its own general?
If you're having trouble, use this: Download the personal edition. There's a time/stack size limit but I doubt you'll be lisping 5 hours straight or doing anything too intricate.
Initialization files are not loaded.I-I'll just get slime working
Good luck!
I'm sorry.  I forgot about this.  What exactly do you want to do?Would you like to see my slime setup from my .emacs?
Sure. I'm using quicklisp, got slime through it, pasted the code it spits out into an emacs file, but then emacs bitches about not being able to find the file, which it's apparently looking in roaming? Not sure why. I might just follow a tutorial to the letter instead of trying to set it up how I'd like it.
Reverse a string recursively. I worked on it a bit, but the method I tried blows the stack:labels f str     coerce cons f coerce cdr coerce str 'list 'string car coerce str 'list 'stringf "whatever"I'm not sure if this is exactly what I did but it's close—I no longer have my original code
Add this to your .emacs:;; Enable MELPArequire 'packageadd-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/elpa"setq package-archives '"gnu". ""melpa" . "M-x install-package and install SLIME that way.Finally add this to your .emacs don't forget to change the path:;; SLIMErequire 'slimesetq slime-contribs 'slime-fancysetq inferior-lisp-program "path-to-your-sbcl"slime-setup 'slime-fancythen do M-x slime and you'll have a fancy repl at your disposal. Happy lisping!
Would you like help?
Absolutely.
I have this currently in my emacs, why doesn't it work this way?load expand-file-name "~/quicklisp/slime-helper.el";; Replace "sbcl" with the path to your implementationsetq inferior-lisp-program "sbcl"
I was going to give you mine, before  posted.That's exactly what I have in mine, except I have the actual path to the sbcl binary as the inferior-lisp-program.
are you on windows? You just need to swap out sbcl with the path to your sbcl executable as the comment says. But in all honesty I've never known anyone who uses slime through quicklisp like that.
Well I changed the pathname, but this error still remains File error: Cannot open load file, no such file or directory, c:/Users/Default/AppData/Roaming/quicklisp/slime-helper.el
Oh. You may need to change the ~/quicklisp/slime-helper.el to whatever the actual path is. Did you just copy and paste this config because I think it may differ for Windows but I have very little knowledge of Windows at all
I don't even know where/what slime-helper.el is or why it's a problem. I'm not sure why it's looking in roaming and not where quicklisp is actually installed. It doesn't help I'm sick and can't remember half the things I've done today.
Wipe your .emacs clean and just use what I told you in It's a lot simpler than what you're trying to do.
How do I even do the m-x install package? I hit esc, hit x, then what? type in install-package slime?
type install-package, hit enter, type slime, hit enter.
when I type install-package and enter, it says "no match"
Did you put the first code block into your .emacs? Close emacs, reopen and then do the package install
Here's an easy to understand version:defun reversotron string  labels helper string index reversed-string             cond  index length string                    setf char reversed-string index char string - length string index 1                    helper string 1+ index reversed-string                   t return-from reversotron reversed-string    helper string 0 make-string length string
Yeah I did, are you sure it's not a linux only function?
Certain.
Actually, this one is better:defun reversotron string  labels helper string index reversed-string             if = index length string                 return-from reversotron reversed-string             setf char reversed-string index char string - length string index 1             helper string 1+ index reversed-string    helper string 0 make-string length string
Ooh. Thank you! I think I got hung up on dealing with the problem with lists.
You're very welcome.  It would be rude to not help people in my own thread.I think I got hung up on dealing with the problem with lists.That's understandable.  If you plan on continuing with Common Lisp, which I would recommend, I suggest you remember that.One tip that you may find useful if you love format as much as me: It's easier to deal with sequences in format if you coerce them to a list first.That's just something to keep in mind.
M-x package-install
I certainly plan to. Now one quick question: is char better for strings than aref, or is it just a clarity thing?
Alright, thats working
My experience with Emacs on Windows is that I could never get it to work properly without setting a HOME environment variable. Based on the output you're getting, I think you should try doing so. You'll need to move your .emacs, or make a fresh one in your home directory afterwards. You can check if it's been set properly from Emacs with getenv "HOME"
So I was playing with format and made something horrendous:format t "~~~{~a~~~}" coerce "dankmemes" 'list
Well now when I append ;; SLIMErequire 'slimesetq slime-contribs 'slime-fancysetq inferior-lisp-program "C:\Program Files x86\Steel Bank Common Lisp\1.2.12\sbcl.exe"slime-setup 'slime-fancy to the .emacs file it gets another error doing with roaming and what not. Do I need to get rid of the;; Enable MELPArequire 'packageadd-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/elpa"setq package-archives '"gnu". ""melpa" . "or leave it?
is char better for strings than aref, or is it just a clarity thing?The hyperspec gives us this:char s j ==  aref the string s jChar is more efficient.  In every case I can currently think of, a more specific function will be optimized.  It's like the difference between = and equal.Always choose the more specific function if you know you will only be dealing with the type of arguments it accepts.
all the slime code you added is redundant to doing a M-x package-install. You might want to check if slime-fancy can be installed with package-install alsothe only part you might want to keep is where you set your inferior-lisp-program
You might want to check if slime-fancy can be installed with package-install alsoto answer my own question, slime-fancy does not get installed on its own, it is part of slime and so to get it to work the following is what your code should look like:setq inferior-lisp-program "sbcl"require 'slime-autoloadsslime-setup 'slime-fancy
But wouldn't it be slower in that case due to the extra computation needed by running the string through the "the" special form first? Not sure if I have the right idea here.
All the does is guarantee that a form will return a number of values of the specified types, lest undefined behavior is invoked.It is usually used for optimizations, but an implementation is not required to optimize anything.
format t "~a~%~{~a~%~}" "DANKMEMES" cdr coerce "DANKMEMES" 'listI need to put DANKMEMES there twice. Anyone know a way on how to put it there only once?
The reason I do not use Lisp is because I cannot decide between CL, Scheme and Clojure and if I pick Scheme I cannot pick an implementation. Other than that, I really fancy it.
Just go ahead and pick one - the Racket docs are excellent
0 - clojure1 - scheme2 - common lispnow just do my post number modulus 3 and go with that one
Well I finally got it, followed what the guy did in this videoit works finally. Had some problems that were caused by not having sbcl/emacs running as admin but I finally got that down pat.
Has anyone tried as a replacement for slime?
I'm years late to the party, but today I discovered that MIT Scheme has 64-bit packages now, including in Debian Jessie.Just for all you SICPers out there looking for a good REPL.
Except that the ride never endsWhen I try to do "ctrl+c-c" to compile my little function here it gives me this error.. why is this?
forgot image
Pretty sure that even if you have a fancy format directive that made this easier you'd still have to type it twice as a parameter. Probably best to just use let to assign your string to a variable and evaluate your format form in the body. Btw, I like this anon, nice.
You're trying to use GNU Emacs on Windows.  Spin up a small Debian VM and use that instead.
Which book should I read if my mind's too stupid to get the functional way?
welcome to emacs
What are you having trouble wrapping your head around?
The general idea of a program, I can only see the final result, I don't see how lisp would ever be interactive
That's not really a functional thing at all IMO. Load up a REPL and try it out. It's hard to explain interactivity; you just have to see it.People rarely compile i.e. to a binary file their Lisp programs for this reason.
Well that's what I mean, you write code, give it data to process and it gives a result and that's it.It's impossible to create any form of daemon with that, I think.
It's impossible to create any form of daemon with that, I think.u wat?
Lisp still has loops. Really powerful ones at that.
Well, can you point me to a program that is able to do so?
is just one example I found.
but why
I have no idea, I had the same problems you do to configure plugins when I gave emacs a try.That's why I stay with vim. I know slime is better but if I can't get it to work then it's useless to me

What plugin do you use, because I don't like emacs in the first place.
I use jpalardy/vim-slime to send the pieces of code to a repl running on tmux. And it's just that, it doesn't offer anything lisp related like a debugger or something similar.is also interesting if you want to achieve the same.if you really want something like slime try 
format t "~{~a~}~%~:*~{~a~%~}" coerce "DANKMEMES" 'list
princ you are truly a wizard. How long have you been Lisping if you don't mind my asking? Also, how did you learn?
Just trying to install Guile. Terrible, terrible experience. Installed all the dependencies, but now I'm getting 'ice-9' errors with no information to rectify them.
is there anything like cl-async for scheme?
Don't call me a wizard just yet.  I've realized an error with this.  I'm not going to stop until I solve this though. I still have many more angles to come at this problem.How long have you been Lisping if you don't mind my asking?I'd like to keep that a secret.Also, how did you learn?I read books about it.  I don't do much in my free time asides from reading books.
Plot twist: you're actually McCarthy's ghost.
That's a plot twist.
I'm actually Erik Naggum's ghost.It feels like this format form would be placed in a function definition.  Do you consider this an acceptable answer?eval `format t "~@{~a~}~%~1@*~@{~a~%~}" ,.coerce "DANKMEMES" 'listHere's what I imagined the function that uses this would look like:defun dank string eval `format t "~@{~a~}~%~1@*~@{~a~%~}" ,.coerce string 'listFormat is probably one of my favorite parts of Common Lisp.
WORKS BUT HOWORKSBUTHOW
This:`format t "~@{~a~}~%~1@*~@{~a~%~}" ,.coerce "DANKMEMES" 'listrenders this:FORMAT T "~@{~a~}~%~1@*~@{~a~%~}" #\D #\A #\N #\K #\M #\E #\M #\E #\SI couldn't just use the list as is, because I needed to skip the first character in the string on the second iteration.
maybe it doesn't have all the futures but checkjust google "your scheme implementation your desired feature" and you might find it, cl-async has lots of features that might be separatted in different libraries for schemes
you should avoid eval.apply formatter "~@{~a~}~%~1@*~@{~a~%~}" cons t coerce "DANKMEMES" 'list
clojure is shitit combines the functionality/practicality of scheme with the purity of common lisp
Common LispPureSchemePracticalI think you mixed these up here.
I don't have the le fahnny point over head picture, so ill just say that you entirely missed the point
Sorry I'm not perfectly attuned to the subtleties of your autism.

Which version of SBCL are you using? 1.2.12 changed the specification of sb-c:policy
I'm running 1.2.12If something changed is the case, what should I do to solve the problem? Use an older sbcl?
Why isn't null called nullp, eq called eqp, etc?
So I managed to get the REPL to work on vim, but mit-scheme seems to go nuts about a variable not being "unbound" when I'm trying to 'define' it. What did I do wrong?define a * 5 5
Is this the only thing you entered? The same definition works on my mit-scheme.
on the cli trough my terminal it works, but it doesn't work on my slimv it seems....
my mistake, the swank interpretter was stuck on sbcl
thinking about sbcl being the problem gives me an ideaswitch sbcl to clispworks just fineGuess I'll just be using clisp now
I've thought about it and I don't see the particular danger in using it how I did.The only thing my function doesn't do is check its argument's type before using it, because I didn't add that.
Can I make mit-scheme print out a sort of stack trace like lisp can?
Someone could pass a dangerous command to the function that deletes the user's home directory. Which would then be evaluated without any questions asked.For showing off eval is perfectly fine, for production code one should avoid it if at all possible. If not possible or if the workaround is too much work then the stuffed passed to it should at least be checked.But yes, for a post on /g/ eval is fine.
For showing off eval is perfectly fine, for production code one should avoid it if at all possible. If not possible or if the workaround is too much work then the stuffed passed to it should at least be checked.I agree.  If I had put a type check in my function, I don't currently see anything that could go wrong that couldn't already occur.Anyways, I rarely get to use this feature of format, so I went ahead and wrote a version that doesn't require coercing the string:defun dank stream string colon at  declare ignore colon at  loop with first = t        for char across string        if first          do setq first nil        else          do princ char stream             terpri streamformat t "~a~%~:*~/dank/" "DANKMEME"Make sure this is evaluated in the cl-user package, unless you want to add a package prefix to the dank call in format.
Doesn't work at all with org-babel.
Grabing an older version 1.2.11 should fix itJust wait for SLIME to catch up before uprgading.
Lisper looking into Elixir for fun. Anyone have any experience with it and want to share?
Anybody has experience with mcclim?I have window that has one pane that inherits application-pane but I create it with default-initargs :scroll-bars nilWhy does it still displays the scroll-bars?
Guile is generally installed by default in Loonixes, so I've never had to do it manually.
At what point does a "trivial" program become "non-trivial"? Is it the program's usefulness? Is it how complicated or long it is?
Generally it's more about how complicated it is in a particular language. However it's a flexible definition. The word "trivial" also describes basic, uninteresting cases in an algorithm e.g. sorting a list with length = 1.
Guile has a straightforward installation process.  ./configure && make && make install.  What command are you trying to run and what is its backtrace?  Have you considered asking about the error in #guile on freenode or writing to guile-user@gnu.org about it?

what's the best way to learn lisp?I've been going through realm of racket and I'm unsure about it
I honestly think one of the best paths is the one I took: The Little Schemer to the Scheme Programming Language, in the meantime developing useful programs for myself with the aid of official documentation via Racket's guide and docs in my and apparently your case. The Little Schemer teaches very little practical things but gets to the heart of Lisp philosophy faster and more accessibly than many books. It's also the most fun book on programming in my opinion. The Scheme Programming Language will teach you Scheme completely. The Scheme programming language and the guide/docs are free, and though the Little Schemer isn't free legally it can be found easily enough.Perhaps most important: don't rely on any one book or resource.
cool i have a bundle of books downloading really slowly and the little schemer is one.I would like to find something kind of like a workbook
It depends on what you are looking for. Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation gives you a good foundation for Lisp if you already know about other common languages. It doesn't really matter with which Lisp you start, the important thing is you learn the syntax.
I have a pretty good understanding of C and I did really well my last 2 java classes. I kind of want something thatll show me programs and not show me a bunch of snippets in the interactive prompt
If your only background is Java and C you might as well start from scratch honestly.
what's the best way to learn lisp?By practicing it!
This → Still, with that background you can at least grasp some context and vocabulary. But it's true, Lisp is a whole different thing.
of like a workbookSICP and HtDP have a lot of exercises in it.

This thread is dieing dying? but there is no color involved.Why is this thread dieing/dying?Why is moot so shit. Oh wait, moot is gone. Why is the current administration so shit?Where is /gg/?
The Little SchemerThe Little Schemer is fucking great.Looks simple at first, but is actually very deep.
mfw I know Common Lisp & Racketmfw I'm about to try and write some simple Clojure program in order to better understand the languagemfw I find out that you can't cast a string to integer without using JavaIs... is this serious? Did I missed something? Where is Clojure's equivalent of string-int?
What is it about this phone, /g/?I realize I'm not looking at anything THAT special in terms of raw hardware and software functionality. Seriously, I get that. But goddamn, there's just something about holding one in my hand and looking at the simple yet elegant interface that tells me I'm dealing with something more than just another piece of consumer electronics. I can't really explain it I guess, it's like I'm holding something special. Like a rare jewel or an Olympic medal. Some kind of prize or treasure.  Like if I was a character in a fantasy game, this would be something I looted from one of the main bosses and will carry with me for the rest of my days. That's the actual vibe I'm getting. Come on, anyone know what I'm talking about?  I can't be the only one who feels this way.
I can get a asus ux305 for about 500 bucks. It bas a 4k display though, will i have any scaling problems with windows or linux?

Pls respond

Im pretty sure resolution scaling on windows is neither tech support nor consumer review shit
I'm pretty sure you're asking about technical problems with the piece of consumer technology you plan to purchase.Literally learn to read lad and get gud.
Stop being an autistic piece of shit. Im not asking something related to a specific piece of consumer electronic but something that applies to literallt every 4k screen. If i didnt say i was planning to buy it youd have said nothing and it would still be the same question.

why are pictures that plack people post on the internet in such poor quality?they did not made these themselves, but copied them, i know But what process exactly makes the pics so blurry?I couldn´t do that even if i wanted
I always wondered. Maybe to make it more "real", idk man. If I would post stupid shit like this I'd at least retype the text so it's clear and sharp again.
they're black.poor quality is their second name.

I'm thinking of setting up a small home server, just for file hosting within my LANHow far would a shitty HP desktop with a Pentium E5200 and 2GB of DDR2 RAM  get me?
Fuck you monkey boy
Get a raspberry pi on it and install samba on it. You don't have to worry about power consumption
Max of 512MB of ramiunno, seems a bit weak
You're only going to use it as a file server.
Hows the performance? I might be pulling some fairly large file off of it
Entirely depends on your network speed.
Would you recommend the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B or Banana Pi?
I'd go with the Raspberry Pi, there's a lot of support and documentation for it, so there's good help if you fuck something up.
I'll give it a shot, cheers for the help
The year is 2015.The month, June.The day, Monday.The date, the 1st.The status of thumbnails in the most popular Linux distros' file selectors: Nonexistent.
There are thumbails everywhere, they are just not present in GTK's selector, but they are there if you use KDE's one. Now go away and try to do something better with your like.
There have been GTK file chooser thumbnail patches for quite awhile now.I'm not sure if they were accepted upstream.

Really ugly. Do you actually use this?
I'm not a fuccboi, so, yes.

No thumbnails when browsing using the command line.That can't be classified as an issue since a command line isn't a GUI.This is not a file selector, it's a file browser.

The year is 2015.The month, June.The day, Monday.The date, the 1stThe statement that there are no thumbnails in GTK file picker is still wrong.Your issue probably is that there is no grid view.
Those aren't thumbnails. They're icons. Please stop shitposting, unintentionally or not.

Those aren't thumbnails. They're icons.maximum shitpost
Thumbnails are not expected in a command line. Please stop being silly. This is my last reply to you.
Thumbnails are reduced-size versions of pictures, used to help in recognizing and organizing themThe second part is key here. You cannot tell differences between similar images with those tiny icons.You're both clearly new to this topic, so I suggest searching about it on the archive.
Thumbnails are not expected in a command line.Neither in the GTK file picker. That was a deliberate decision.Also I can get image previews in Terminology.what are magnifying glasses

openSUSE is not a mainstream desktop distro.
The second part is key here. You cannot tell differences between similar images with those tiny icons.True scotsman fallacy. A thumbnail is just a reduced-size version of a bigger image, the fact that it may be too small to differentiate between some images does not make it not a thumbnail.
In this case, it does. The reason thumbnails exist is to identify images without needing to open them. Tiny icons are useless for that.
nice windows 95

I can clearly identify them. Not that guy you were talking to by the way. It may be small but it is a thumbnail. It shows the preview of the image file. That's it. You retards are talking about icon view. So if you are going to post these retarded threads still just say icon view. GTK file picker has thumbnails but doesn't have icon view
Those are indeed thumbnails.If they were 2 very similar images with different text, you wouldn't be able to identify them, as you can't even read the text.
But why? You can't use two of them to see whats on the picture, which means that according to your definition they aren't thumbnails.

The status of native gif image support in the most popular Windows OSes: Nonexistantphotos app opens gifs. not animated ones, but it's still something, i guessThe status of instant plug and play instead of 'searching for drivers' for common USB devices in the most popular Windows OSes: Nonexistantit's instant enough unless you're using a toaster, plus 'searching for drives' is so windows xpThe status of being a shot at relatively virus free ecosystem in the most popular Windows OSes: Nonexistantirrelevant to the actual OS; related to market share, huge market share - lots of potential targets - more virusesThe chances of being using in embedded systems which require high perfomance spacecrafts satellites, etc in the most popular Windows OSes: Nonexistantthose require high reliability, not performance. also they use custom OSes.The ability to update without shuting down in the most popular Windows OSes: Nonexistantin some cases, yeah, i guessThe existance of an efficient packagw manager in the most popular Windows OSes: Nonexistantidk, chocolatey? if you really want one? or use ninite to install your crap?The ability to read any filesystem other than FAT or NTFS without showing 'format to use this drive' option in the most popular Windows OSes: Nonexistantit reads ReFS too, and there are 3rd party apps to read other filesystemsThe ability to use hardware resources more efficiently in the most popular Windows OSes: Nonexistantdepends. still better gaymin perfomance than anything else, so there's that
Winfags grasping at straws
I use chocolatey for a while and to be honest it's not that good, the pakages are often outdated or even abandoned, number of package is not that many, you can't resolve dependecies, and obviously you can't update your system alongside with all those packages

Is this an acceptable way to update graphics drivers finally? Or will it fuck up my installation to the point where I have to use third party driver-cleaning software, like the last time I used it?
windows experience
Games Ready DriverThere are nvidia drivers which aren't game readyOh I am laffin
I never get it works seriously it just keep force closedUsually i just go the their website and download from thereWhat a shit updater
Why is updating graphics drivers still so complicated in 2015? Not like it's hard, but everything else has gotten so easy in comparison.
niveano driversenjoy your 3.5 no drivers ;
Really?The "Game Ready" drivers are specifically set up for performance in specific titles.  In other words, optimization.  How is that a bad thing?I've used it for about a year now, no problems at all.
GeForce Experience is a great prorgram.They're game optimizing thing isn't that good, but the drivers/updating shit is.
it just sits there on "preparing for installation"it seems like this is an extremely common problem.what the fuck?
manually install the driver then
i never had problems with it
what is package management
way to do it OP. If on a winOS.
ALWAYS do a clean uninstall and install when getting new drivers. Always.
I've never run into a problem updating the drivers through that software. Don't know what you're talking about.
thats the way I upgrade drivers, never had a problem
Yeah, if you're a fucking retard who somehow fucks up the install every god damn time.
Nvidias GeForce Experience program is fucking bloatware filled with ads. The only reason to use it is for Shadowplay.At least with AMD you can use their Shadowplay feature with third party recording programs with their own VCE codec, meanwhile you're stuck using Nvidias proprietary program and codec in their bloatware/spyware program.
My sound drivers get raped with every update nVidia is rolling in. I need to fiddle with the settings for a while. Otherwise it's okay.
Better to be safe than sorry.
This is why I jumped ship. NVIDIA's starting to limit you any way they can.
Shadowplay used to bsod me every time.
Can you please uninstall that shitty nvidia GeForce experience program? It does nothing but bloat your system. Also make sure you uninstall/don't install 3D vision controller drivers, 3D Vision drivers and HJD Audio Drivers. Unless you use them of course.
no problems here, i have a gtx570
How hard is it to get a job at IBM? Is it possible without a meme paper? i.e. college degree
you need contacts and show great skill
well my friend in Scotland knows some guy in London who's worked for them for the past 20 years and is fairly high up the ladder, guy's fucking loaded according to him, London penthouse, etcAnd what kind of skill?
a friend of a friend will get me a job at IBMLet us know how that turns out for you.
lmao, yeah, I know anyway, is there anything I could go into there just doing like basic shit that a high school grad could do and work my way up?
Not only do they want the meme paper, they want a 3.0 GPA
work my way upNo such thing
Really? So how did that friend work his way up?
God damnit, just show them your FizzBuzz skills and you are in
you could maybe janitor. might be able to work your way up to tp storeroom supervisor, given 20 years hard work.

Post, rate and compare vimrcs, + general vim discussion.nvimrc:seem to fit together really awkwardly. Anyone have any configuration tips for them?
Unitenot FZF
That's funny, I actually have fzf installed and use it all the time, but I never bothered reading the readme, so I had no idea it was a vim plugin!
The only non-vanilla things I use are gtags-cscope, Solarized, and plasticboy's Markdown. Does everything I need.
I'll give you guys a bump and rant a bit.I really don't know what Vim's purpose is at this point in time.  For sysadmins, it's just a really heavy-weight replacement for vi.  For programmers, it's just a poorly designed Emacs the progress of the Neovim project is proof of that; people really want what Emacs offers.All this effort spent jury-rigging Vim and Neovim could be better spent on improving the Emacs ecosystem and code.  That is, instead of spending years of man-hours trying to implement Emacs in Vim Neovim, one month of those man-hours could be spent perfecting Vim emulation in Emacs for all those Vim apologists, and the rest of those years of man-hours improving the speed of the Emacs Lisp core and Emacs documentation.  Everyone wins.
the progress of the Neovim project is proof of thatWhat kind of logic is that?Aren't Vim emulators for Emacs also the proof that Vim is what people want?
I see what you're saying to an extent, but just because people who are interested in neovim want better extensibility support, doesn't mean we want emacs style "everything and the kitchen sink".We want *some* extensibility, but a balance between vanilla vim and emacs.I don't want an email client and all these other things in my text editor.To be clear though, better extension support is only one of neovims goals. As I understand it, the other two primary ones are- Refactoring/Cleaning up the codebase/removing legacy codeBasically removing a bloat to make it easier to read and maintain- decoupling the logic from the interface to form a client/server model. This would allow any editor to access an nvim server to edit text. Theoretically, you could make emacs use an nvim server.- Also, perfect Vim emulation in emacs would mean implementing vim in elisp. Which would obviously be idiotic.
Hurrdurr Photoshop is so much better than GIMP because I said so!GIMP sucks because I don't know how to use it!I wonder how many of you faggots even know how to use an image editor. Pic related, something I made in GIMP. Show me what you can do.
I am learning inkscape through the tutorial, I really like that is keyboard centric. I never thought I could feel like in a text editor on a vector graphics program
I don't really use Inkscape. I'm more into making GIFs rather than vectors.Do you make animu wallpaper vectors? That seems to be the most common use of Inkscape among people on 4chan.
Aaaaaand saved.
You've created a masterpiece.
This, the little black line above the anime guy to trigger people's autism combined with the fact that it was made in GIMP is beautiful.
Why should I use a program that has a horrible UI?I don't care how good it is, if it is a pain in the ass to use.
horrible UIIn case you weren't aware, you can customize it. It's only as bad as you make it.Additionally, a lot of people don't know that you can change it from the multi-window setup to a single window. It's now like the bad old days.Honestly, you sound like you've never even used GIMP.
That's cool. I'll just open Photoshop
As a newb GIMP user, the UI is godawful but have you got any tutes?
How many hours did you spent on this masterpiece?
gonna leave this here to people who are interested in trying GIMP and there's something they miss. Definitely try G'MIC though, that is the absolutely essential, it has everything
I want to build my next PC as quiet as possible.Older fans seem to get louder every year, even if they were originally pretty silent.What's the best setup to achieve this, aside from the obvious?I've been looking at water cooling since it seems to be comparatively easy today, so I'm guessing that will take care of the huge fan over the CPU.Then there's the case fans and GPU which can make a lot of noise. I'd really like really quiet ones, even if I have to give up some power as a tradeoff. I don't need a top of the line GPU since most games run just fine even with older 7850 cards.Tl;dr silent computing thread?
Waterloop it!
Waterloop it!Watercooling isn't even quieter most of the time, unless you're talking about passive radiators.
Custom water loop gives you the holy grail of cool and quiet. Maximise radiator capacity and use low rpm quiet fans optimised for static pressure.  Run your fans at 5v or 7v for even more silence, or hook them up to a pwm controlled hub and let your motherboard regulate your fan speed based on system temperatures. Mount your pump on noise absorbing materials. Choose a PSU that is 50% overspecced for the wattage you need, and ideally one that operates in passive mode under low load.
I'm not op, but i think the game is not worth
Everything you think you know is wrong.
English motherfucker do you speak it
Yes!!!!! Yes!!!!
I have a custom watercooling loop though.
Is waterlooping worth it, then?As much as I like cool and quiet, I don't want it to be a nuisance if I have to open the case and do something.I'll be getting a new case too, but I suspect water cooling has it's space requirements? that may or may not fit everywhere.
Just get a good case with noise dampening foam./thread
Is waterlooping worth it, then?"Proper" Not closed loop shit watercooling is very expensive. Only get it if you have a lot of money to spend.If you want it to be seriously quiet, get a passive radiator no fans. They are very large and have to sit outside of your case, and their cooling performance isn't very good compared to a radiator with fans, but they make virtually zero noise.I don't want it to be a nuisance if I have to open the case and do somethingInstalling it is a massive pain in the ass at first, especially if you're dealing with GPU waterblocks. As long as you put anti-bacterial shit in the water, you shouldn't even need to do anything else to the loop.I suspect water cooling has it's space requirementsPretty much every modern case has enough space for watercooling. Even most Mini-ITX cases have room for a 240 radiator.

No doubt dude, the best thing about the tech industry is the lack of dickheads. People are usually brogrammers. But you should look towards San Francisco if you want job security; I heard startups hire like crazy out there. New York has great tech jobs for people with your level of expertise, you could easily land a job with a very generous salary. Boston is just the best though. We're a small town, everyone knows everyone. Networking is so easy, and Boston always has that 'yeah man lets be cool man!' vibe to it. And yes, monster is a great platform imo. Not super professional ofcourse, but it gets what you need done. Good luck bro, hope you make it! Russian remote coders are the fucking best btw.

Anyone in the Computer Security area have any advice on how to transition from Web Development into Computer Security?My background is mainly object oriented methodologies, so I hopefully won't have to re-learn alot
There are so many different disciplines within computer security, you're going to need to be a little more specfic about what you want to do.
You count experience from full time work, not from designing a website here and there.8 years experience means literally 8 years on the job. If you worked weekends for 8 years then it's only around 1 year actual experience.I know a few guys who went into security private and gov't and all they did was apply for entry level jobs. You don't need to be a hacker who gets recruited or anything crazy, security is like any other job.
Lol I seriously doubt he has 8 years of experience on programmingAs a brazilian, you'd take classes on programming only if you got money, and that's not the case since he said himself that he needed money to buy stuff and brazilian rich parents just give shit to their kids
Not CompSec, although it is part of my job: there are only really two ways, knowing the right people and getting certified. Preferably both. You also have to be pretty good. If you don't know what CSRF or a NOP slide is or how to get around NX you're not going to stand a hope in hell.
Thanks man. Nothing comes close to getting knowledge from a guy firsthand. I will try to look on the Boston and San Francisco market. This seems so surreal, four years back I was struggling to pay our house rent and now going to america is as real as anything else. Life sure is good.Btw. I am not russian, I come from Poland. It's just that my accent feels just russian. Also you made me laugh with "little town Boston". I am living in a city called Gdansk, which is one of the biggest cities in Poland.. little over 400k lol.
It depends greatly on where you live. People think tech jobs make good money because the jobs in NY and SF throw the average way, way off. I live in Kansas City. My first programming job was $9/hr. My second job was $10/hr. Those were small companies though. I'm now working at a pretty big place pseudo-government and making $23/hr. That's considered really good here.

Yeah of course my nigga. I suggest you start off with some object oriented language: It'll be hard but it'll make everything else sooo much fucking easier. C++ is the best language of all time, especially from a learning point of view.  O'Reilly Publishes great programming material, I've never come across a book from them that isn't quality. Practical C++ Programming literally changed my life. Join IRC's MAKE A GITHUB AS EARLY AS YOU CAN. EVEN IF ITS JUST 2 LINES OF CODE, JUST DO IT. Make a LinkedinGet on meetup, and go to meetups.

You won't pay 100k for a cs degree.It's not indentured slavery, I never put in more than an hour work a week on average including exam period. You get to network a lot, and fuck around in real life with people who also like computers.If you want to fuck around in a NEET-like fashion that is socially acceptable then well, it's not NET...Not that I value the actual degree though. Sure you get exposed to a lot of things, but if you've worked for a year already then you probably know more than a PHD will teach you.If you just want to make bank, then yeah, work.
I suggest you start off with some object oriented languagenoooooo

I mean even as a super duper NSA hacker, it all boils down toWhat is my problem?How can I solve this problem?Craft the logic to solve problemProblem solvedProblem not solved? Ask a senior / git guud/ stackoverflowsavemeplswelcome to programming? Or maybe I am just a babby web developer.
wow you clearly know nothing about problem solving or how it relates to CS
All sufficiently interesting problems are no longer defined over the domain of “inputs and outputs” and require more than just “crafting logic” to solve.“Crafting logic to solve problems” is how to get through algorithms 101. Won't help you design a good type system.
1. Find something you want to do eg .NET seems popular in this thread, so ".NET webapp dev"2. find a website that has job listings and see what kinds of skills they are looking for eg WAMP familiarity, sql, asp.net, c#, agile methodologies, etc.3. Do the thing that you want to get the job for eg build an actual web app that is real and works.4. While building it just google "how to do X" whenever you have a problem, it's not rocket science. Try learn all the skills.5. You now have the skills and experience needed to do the job, so go apply for the job, show off that you can actually do the job.It's not that hard.
I mean I did exaggerate on a few points but still my point is I don't believe anyone should have to pay for the college experience... simply because It's only an experience. You could gain a much stronger network by joining a tech bootcamp for under 5k, going to meetups, and being active in your startup community. What really makes me hate college is the fact that we're brainwashed into thinking it's necessary to have a good life. I already get the 'OHMYGODHESBLACK AND NOT SHOOTING US' reaction when I tell people I'm working for a good company, but it HURTS when people are surprised I'm 19 and a drop out...

Any programming program can be brought down to a set of test inputs and outputs plus constraints eg invariants, time, space.You mean all algorithms 101 exercises, yes.Or was there some other point you are trying to make?Sufficiently interesting problems are *not* about programming - that's what code monkeys are for.

No dude this is definitely the hard part, and where the difficulty can vary from field to field... But my point is that everything we do as developers boil down to these 3 pointsIdentify problemIdentify potential solutionmagic
No. North Texas
By stream I meant work flow, not classes.. If that's what your sides just took off for. And I guess I'm a code monkey. But I'm a well paid one, and all of my free time is dedicated to becoming a master. So yeah. I'll be a 19 year old code monkey. But my 29, I will be Neo from the fucking matrix.

By stream I meant work flow, not classes.. If that's what your sides just took off for.Holy shit, this is getting more and more hilarious.Troll or genuine? If former, I applaud you
No one ever said the problems were about programming, but if your just is a dev job then you are going to be solving problems by programming eventually.Can you give an example of something that can't be solved with test driven development? I've only ever worked in TDD/agile paradigm, and I don't think I've seen anything written that can't be tested.Also I think any job that is a 'programming' job involves coding.Unless you are a sysarch or maybe lead dev you are probably going to be writing code every day.

Boston. We're cool. It's a small city, not very crowded.
its a little more complex than that most times.  There are a lot of problems which you have to solve yourself. Something is wrong figure out what is actually wrong figure out how its supposed to work step through in a debugger and/or do a ton of RE read a shitload of specifications and manuals run a ton of testsI'm a capabilities development specialist at the NSA, and I guarantee you that the steps necessary to solve problems are far more complex that what you've laid out.  If you're encountering real problems, rather than just lacking understanding of a common problem, you can't just ask someone, you need to come up with the solution yourself.

I'm looking for some advice and this thread seems like a decent spot to do that.I'm looking to either get a degree in Computer Science or Software Engineering. I'm not sure which one to choose and I'm having trouble deciding because I've already taken a bunch of courses on the path for CS and I would have to take a bunch of first year SENG courses if I went that path. Is going backwards worth it for SENG or should I continue on towards CS? Any advice is appreciated.
Yeah, I disqualified Boston and started looking @ Lafayette. Do wonder how it's gonna go. I will pick a few imigrant-friendly companies, or just goo offers, and apply for them today.

Whats a good salary in the bay area then? I'm interviewing with companies out there and would like to know what I should be negotiating for...
Well, it wasn't so tough, since I started learning Norwegian already in Poland we actually moved because my stepfather is Norwegian and wanted to move back from Warsaw.The worst things were probably that I'm used to big cities and now I'm living in a place under 10k and I didn't really have friends here before uni, since everyone here knew everyone else from their childhood, so I was mostly talking with my friends from Poland on the net.You can always try talking with some Norwegian companies too, you could get by with just English in tech companies.

moving to Faglifornia when Boston has plenty of tech jobs, lower cost of living, and driving distance to NH
Ah sorry, driving and didn't read context.Just loom at average rent and quadruple it. You shouldn't pay 25% of your gross income for housing

Most companies HQs are out there sadly. Boston isn't nearly as big as Silicon Valley. For instance the Google office in Boston is like half sales / non engineers.Also who the fuck would want to commute to Boston every day from NH? Even living in Nashua on the border that's a 2 hour commute in rush hour. And if you work in MA but live in NH you still have to pay MA state income tax.Anyways my plan is if I get an awesome offer I'll move out there for a few years then try to move back to New England. Maybe Seattle.

Other than Boston, SV, and NY what are some good cities for developers that offer close to the same salaries?
You can live with roommates but because you aren't already living in the area it's hit or miss trying to find cool people who aren't sociopaths.But as a whole the bay area populous is more "high-tech" than most areas.I'm in Florida right now and my company is trying to get me to move to the home office in San Mateo.Florida is a shithole, but no federal income tax and cheap leaving is king.
Don't just look at the salary,  you need to factor in cost of living.  Theres a reason why salaries in thise areas are so high.

but no federal income taxWhat? How does Florida avoid FEDERAL income tax?
Sorry, state.Nice catch, I'm off this morning
There's no real answer for that, it's really subjective. All I can say is keep doing digging
We do pay federal, I'm sure he meant state. North florida here. Bunch of rednecks but man it's cheap.
implying I meant to commute from NH every dayTrue but whats the point of having NH close by if you don't live there? Or was your point "why move 3000 miles"?
Ah so its like a cheaper New Hampshire then. New Hampshire isn't that cheap as far as rent goes. Better than Boston obviously but worse than Western MA.
Point was that you could still easily go back to NH regularly to visit people and places you know.

True, the key to making it in programming is to literally be a hipster and work on the most underground programming jobs you've never heard of.

Looking for some advice, hopefully someone here can help.Just graduated last week with a degree in physics from a decent UK university. Achieved first class honours, so I know physics and maths to a pretty high level. I have no interest in getting a PhD and working in academia. Decided my dream job would be some kind of developer at a games company, maybe a physics or audio programmer, something along those lines.Problem is I have next to no programming experience. Is it even possible to get hired as a junior or trainee programmer where you can learn on the job? Or am I going to have to get some random shit job and teach myself how to program in a few languages before I have any chance of landing a developer job somewhere?I'm 28 now so I don't really want to put off getting a career any longer. Most of you here seem to have what I would consider great careers, or at least great prospects. What should I do?

Why is Floens the most laziest app creator and why should you all support him by using clover?
Heonly updates once every half yeartook him around 2 months to fix a broken captchabarely listens to your ideasdoesnt know what material design isis a retard because the old captcha still springs up sometimes
Dashchan is where it's at until that material 4chan app that only exists as a webm and 4 pics actually happens.
am I the only one that had the ink blots shit recently?no webm support, no dice
why don't you make a better app or enjoy the fact that Clover is FOSS and compile yourself a new version?
because you're app isn't perfect Floens, and we like to start threads to bitch about it
Don't care about Floens right now. The question is when the fuck will the Chanobol dev update his app and implement the reply function? It's been over a month now.
Why is Floens the most laziest app creatorHe is working on Material Update dude... Google just finally release a Design support library... i hope that library speed up work
Florens is based. He does it For Free so go fuck yourself. Sorry he can't magically do just what you want him to do all the time instantly. Literally fork it up or shut your mouth.
Anyone else using Overchan? The captcha stopped appearing for me, not sure if it's a problem on my end.
Why do people always shit on developers that browse /g/?
buttmad because they can't develop for shit and gotta criticize people that the board like in order to feel better
What do you mean by that?
As in the captcha just won't appear at all, ink blots or the new one.
Mimi4ChanReader and Dashchan still master race
does anyone else use chanu? it's the best I've used
did Mimi ever get captcha fixed?
Floens pls go
What the fuck are you talking about? Clover is the best 4chan app I've ever used.I dunno about recently, but a couple months ago when Google kept fucking up the captcha, Floens had updates to fix it the very next day. Hardly what I would consider lazy...
This. The app doesn't need an update every week, it just werks.Also, please no material design. I like it as it is.
Just use Dashchan already..
Where the hell did Miko Dev go?

no native webm support
F-Droid, not GPlay
Those poor dogs. Pedigree breeding has really fucked them up.
I think it has webm support. Or my phone does natively, because I can open them.
It just werks
Clover has native webm support, so that's what I use
Is that an app? Screen/link please.
Because mimi is buggy as shit Chanu is slow to update unless you like compiling from sourceAnd the others ones last i checked dont post
 that DPI
Oh fuck I'm using that theme now, that is sexyyy
Because Mimi went from the best 4chan app of all time to ABSOLUTE FUCKING SHIT literally overnight when he "overhauled it" into the piece of fucking shit it is today.After that the next best thing is Clover, granted you  have a 4chan pass.I don't understand why every single app developer went from the insanely functional ChanExplorer layout that allowed extremely easy left/right swiping to watch multiple threads at once, to the god-awful party van style of SINGLE THREAD LOADED AT A TIME, WITH STUPID BOOKMARKS, HURR SO BEAUTIFUL
something is wrong with your screen m8
Something is wrong with your sleep patterns
He's updated things that I told him about in threads, Floens is gud nigger
He is using some stupid screen changer shit like flux for PC  placebo is his favorite word
I can't find it on F-droid either
Then tell him to start supporting image captcha
Why is everyone brainwashed by material design?People nowdays seem to believe material design is an absolute MUST for any app that exists. Why the fuck do you give two shits if the app changes the color of your notification bar to match? Fuck off. Apps looked just fine for eons before anyone gave a shit about material design.
It's on f-droid and Google Play. Doesn't win in the design department but I don't care about that, it's functional.
Flux is good, granted you don't go overboard with it. It is in absolutely no way a placebo.
then google it for fucks sake, I have no clue I told you already I use Clover, fuck off
miko when?
Post more screenshots. I can't decide if I like that design or not...
It will never happen.
This is why I never released my own personal 4chan app to the public. I only made it for myself, and if others used it I would have to spend time dealing with their whining.
caring about people whining on 4chan
This, keep it as it is don't mess with something that has been working just fine
I don't know. He doesn't update captcha enough. I always have to reset the app after each post or it won't working. Gives me "LOADING CAPTCHA".
To anybody who wants chanu:search Chanu GPLv3 - F-Droiddownload apkOr dashchan:anybody who wants overchan, clover, mimireader, chanobol, leaf, it's all on the google play storeIt's the least I can do since I got this all from you guys
Floens, pls
CONSISTENCYIf we're going to be shoved Material design in almost every app, I want at least most other apps to be consistent.plus black status bars are lame. tinted is a nice change
For the hundredth time, can someone explain to me why the latest version won't load captchas at all, and the version before this only had the trolling inkblot captchas.
I don't know what the fuck's wrong with you bro, but mine has been working fine
Mine's working just fine buddy. What phone have you got?
I've got an old Motorola xt912. The older versions worked just fine minus the inkblot bullshit, and then I upgraded a month ago to the new captchas. At that point it would intermittently fail to load the captchas, so I went back to the old version with inkblot. I decided to try the new version again last week and I haven't been able to get a single captcha to load. I'm not sure what the issue is. I've cleared my cache and I have a few geebees of space left on my internal memory.
tfw Party Van is forever kill
How did you switch to the new version?
I installed it from the google play. IIRC f-droid still has the inkblot version. I just cleared my cache, move the app into internal store, then back to SD card and it seems to work. Not sure why the fixed it, but it did for now. Thank for, based Floens.
I've been using overchan
never ever, you have to do it by yourself
Oh I thought you were the poster asking about overchanThoughts?
I like it.  Supports webm, got it from F-Droid, and it doesn't make my eyes bleed.
It's a pretty sick 4chan app tbh, very underrated if you look at the big picture of it
Is there a setting to have 4chan as your starting image board on Dashchan? Tired of seeing commie text every time I open the app
This faggot killed Chanu which is the best 4chan browser because they're similar enough to make him sue them
Blatantly false
Sorry but the dev reps russia
This shit still happensfucking annoying as fuck, I don't know how everyone else puts up with it.
It already exists under the name 'Clover."Miko is just a Clover fork with material design and ricey transitions
Been using clover for months and that's never happened to me
I was going to post this.That problems probably phone related
floen bb
Flux makes my computer lag :O
Why don't you just fork the app?
The captcha issue is very unfortunate, because I cannot reproduce the problem on any of my devices. The code is exactly the same as say Chanu and that's why I struggle to fix it. if any of you could let me debug your device, be it through teamviewer with you having android studio open, I'll be glad to do it.Clover v2 is a huge overhaul code-wise, more than 75% has been changed. I decided against hacking a material version together, instead I restructured the app completely to make it easier for me to add new features later on. v2 is almost complete feature wise versus v1. Soon I will be uploading v2 beta's to the google+ testing group.I programmed most of the material elements myself, mainly because Google has not given developers any official support for Lollipop elements on pre Lollipop devices. A few days ago Google released the design support library with the FAB, navdrawer, text with floating labels and more so I will be using that now.
Not coming up on F-Droid or Startpage/DDG searches. Where can I find this?
miko is a alin? i cant find it for andriod.
Just Want to let you know that your app is the best in it's niche. Tried all the other apps but always came back to Clover. Great job man, looking forward to v2.
Thanks for everything floens, I will be happy to wait for this update.Look at
Soon I will be uploading v2 beta's to the google+ testing group.Can you also upload them to F-Droid? I constantly forget about the G+ group, and even then, don't like using G+.
Leaf is awful
Agree
How about the Overchan captcha code? It has the same feature as Dashcan.
This please
Does anyone else's Clover not produce thumbnails when looking for/uploading webms?
What the fuck do you mean, it works perfectly.

What is this cyka shit?
DashChan is the android client for Russian 2ch
Oh, I figured it out. Damn this looks nice.
I think clover is pretty good. But i have an issue with clover on my tablet where it just won't play webms in the app. I have to open webms in external player which is quite annoying
Chanobol also has this problem that it doesn't sharpen the image from it's thumbnail size,you can't even read images that have text in them.When that'll be fixed, it'll actually be useable at least as a read-only.
Definitely a better solution, why not just make it a little more public? The G+ group isn't hard to get into, it just seems really messy tho
Are you using a custom ROM? I had this problem too and I had to change from OmniRom to Cyanogenmod.
Meant for 
Did you pay for it, faggot?
clover could have been the best chan app out there.But it still lacks a hide/filter option for threads and  posts.And that pretty much ruins it
using placeboReport and move on, man.
why should you all support him by using clover?nobody care if you use it or not, how do you thinks it works?Anyway I think clover is fine, the only real problem is 
Yea I'm using slimkat
Wasn't there a russian FOSS Clover alternative?



Howd you change the top of the app to match your status bar?
Isn't that an android L feature?It's rather the status bar that matches the app.
Instructions pls
Well, I'm still stuck on gingerbread, but if the app doesn't automatically change the colour, you have to get xposed and install the module "Lolistat".There's a way to get this effect in kitkat, but that's a different module.
Who is this goddess?

are you a pirate? how would you feel if people stole what you put years of your life into?
Yes, and I use adblock too.
if you don't want people to have certain  information, you should keep it secret
Woo! The daily copyright shill thread! Hi copyright shill! Hiiiiiiii!
I put years of my life into pirating media. Why won't the content cartel pay me in cash for my efforts? I'm not a charity.
I simply license everything under the GPL 2.
I am. Everything i created was always provided free to use. Which includes music and little programs.
Oh boo hoo the poor Hollywood jews./thread
All information and media should be free.
I pretty much give away everything I do.  So, don't care much.  I take back less than I give.Also, copies are not "theft."
what is the evolution of words and vocabulary
If piracy is a concern of yours then you shouldn't be making the product to begin with.
Added :^ to all alphabet agencies watch lists
I try not to, unless there's a program I absolutely need with no free alternative. I'm too lazy to pirate, honeslty
pirateMind your words: class="quote"stoleCopying is not theft:download warez, block ads and use free software whenever I can. No regrets.

years of my life went into education.can someone steal my debt.
how would you feel if people stole what you put years of your life into?Better than if nobody ever saw it.
10/10
Why would they steal it? I already give away all of my software for free.
This.I'd be honored to have someone like anything I made so much that they had to pirate it
goddamn pirates;_;
why does this guy keep posting pics of himselfsome hermit
I put an app on google play once, I wouldn't mind if folks pirate it at all, but fucking buying it and charging back is soul destroying.ooh I made a sale!oh wait, no I didn't - fuck
If people aren't pirating it,it's shit OP
When i was a boy, we bought albums pressed on vinyl and copied them to cassette tapes. We gave them to friends. we made mix taoes for parties. We traded them or gave them away. Dual cassette recorders started showing up on store shelves. Now record comoaies have to compete with iTunes. And record companies are still promoting music aimed at 14 year olds because baby boomers bought a billion Elvis and Beatles records. Well those baby boomers are in their 60s and 70s now. The only people who want Miley Cyrus records are 14 year olds and their aren't as many as there used to be. Stop blaming your outdated business model on illegal sharing, it's been around forever.
tfw learning assembly to bypass any restrictions in OP's software
If people stoleI'd be pretty pissed.If people made a replica of, keeping the originals in tact.I don't know, I wouldn't give too much of a fuck.
In 8 hours and 8 minutes the FBI is going to raid your house for pirating. What do you do anon?
people do steal from me every day through taxation.  They also do it through corruption of the government.
Niceme.me
40keks
I hope you're not saying all taxation is stealing, because it does often provide benefits for the public good.However, you're right that in the hands of a corrupt government, a lot of times it just lines the pockets of government officials and the corporations they're in bed with.Ideally, taxation would be used to better our society by providing social services like education and healthcare that everyone benefits from, but in a corrupt government, you'll get "hey, let's half-ass everything and make mad dosh!" See: the US.
Wake up, because I'm obviously dreaming, for the FBI would never raid a home for downloading TV shows.
They would if Hollywood would pay enough officials.
In 8 seconds, pirate the FBI for housing
The things I put years of my life into cannot be trivially reproduced.
They day that comes, I'm moving to an abandoned oil rig.
I make porn. Literally - seriously - TENS OF MILLIONS have pirated content I've produced mostly tube site views.I'm never going to pay for a movie/music ever again outside of Netflix/Spotify/going to the movie theater, and I'll sleep like a baby thinking about it.
make great paintingmuseum buys it for 2mil, plus you get an extra 10 cents for every museum guest that looks at itsomeone takes a photo of it and shares it onlineOH NO I LOST 20$. MY ENTIRE WORK IS RUIIIIINED!
Most piratefags are kiddies and poorfags, so it doesn't matter to me.Shit woukd suck if you were a startup and your only oriducts were being primarily pirated. That's when I would start seeding adware.
I know you're lying or fucking retarded if yiu aren't prifiting from major tubesites.
I profit off them too. But "users" still continue to upload my content that doesn't get tracked/I don't get paid for, have to DMCA, etc.
Must ask, is your content on efukt?
It actually did save one video game from obscurity, The Red Star. It was going to be published by Acclaim, but they went bankrupt. The new owners of the IP weren't going to do anything with the completed game until they saw how popular it was on the torrents, so they published it on the PS2, and later on other platforms. The only way to get the best version on the Xbox is to pirate it.
Well, think of the children, they don't have paypal or CCs.m-mom.. can I borrow dad's cc?no dear, why would you need that?I only wanted.. you know.. hot.. kinky..what did you say, dear?I wanted to download hotkinky vid-*slap*
Kek. No.
how would you feel if people stole what you put years of your life into?I'd feel great because I want my work to be shared with everyone freely without restrictions.
If you have no problem with people 'pirating' then you should have no problem with companies 'pirating' GPL or simular licensed software. What I mean by that is that these companies should be able to ignore the license and do whatever they want.
It means my work wasn't that good and I could if done better. The worse off something is sometimes more piracy
stoleright, right. Next thing people usually say about it is something about the number of downloads being equal to the number of copies unsold, and for some reason all those people have something to do with copyright organizations and not the production itself.
i wouldn't care because i would never go into it so naive
Didn't say piracy was bad. But the*coughcough*, piracy is actually no worse than sending pictures *sniff* and piracy was invented by the NSA to imprison americans...stuff is dumb
tried copying and pasting this into a post, but 4chan says its spam. All the words and phrases seem pretty innocuous, what triggered the filter?
Maybe because was already posted in the thread: 
I mean the actual text itself.
But I'd still have whatever they pirate from me. That's not stealing and I think you should take a class in English.
trying to mislead and marginalize file sharing by calling it piracy is right? maybe i should start calling litterers rapists and it would be okay. imagine when someone see you littering and says "Hey! Stop raping you rapist"maybe we start calling studios and publishers thiefswell it would be only word evolution.
its not stealing, im just making a copy of ityes but you invested time and energy into making a product that you were going to sell and all that time and energy is now wasted
if we are being ambiguousdo you know those faggots that have their files encrypted and it asks for money to allow him to access them again? drm is pratically the same shitso by that logic drm is malwarepirates are removing fucking malware from filesthose and those assholes that hate pirates are distributing malware
Music I am totally fine with. Also if I were a famous musician I would not mind if people pirated my music, but when it comes to software and games especially independent developers is where I would draw the line.
Depends how reasonable my business practices were.
If I made something that was worthy/popular enough to be pirated I would be glad people would see/hear/use it and if it was that popular I would probably still be making money off of it anyway.
The entertainment industry makes about 15% of the U.S economy, with this being said no one care's.
For their personal use? Sure, no problem.
But drm *is* malware. That should have been blindingly obvious from the start.Not disagreeing, but you can't really pirate GPL software.
people use porn pay-to-watch sites because there are no ads and you can get all the shit you like in one placetubes will never be able to compete with that unless somebody decides to finance porn sites himself
You're making the assumption that you own the software. You're licensing it.
Yep, and I wouldn't like it. Just like I'm not a cucumber farmer but don't give a shit that I stick perfectly made cucumbers up my ass hole and throw them away without eating them.
How would feel spending years working on something to sell, then realizing that you're so retarded that you forgot copying exist
I'd never sell software to begin with, free as in free. I'm not going to make anything else anyway  so I'd feel pretty good.
he fell for the licensing meme
good look when theh start to do "licensing"  to cars
I give away my own efforts of years time. Information is an over saturated commodity. It is worthless.
It was love at first sight. Googled for 30 minutes straight to find the original picture. It's Ririka Katou from Bodacious Space Pirates. I'm off to fap now.
I wouldn't feel very good about it.
How did you even know where to start looking
Who is this guy .
The sysadmin
the Anime Character database. I put in some info about her, such as hair color and eye color, but I didn't get anything. So I just googled the line in the subtitle, and got the name of the anime.I'm like a weeaboo NEET sleuth.
You sound like a soccer mom
As long as they don't make money off of it, I couldn't give a fuck.
Because I believe putting a patent on sound waves is stupid. It's like trying to copyright pictures anyone can take of nature and shit. It's stupid and if they want to make money, they should do another career. Most people make music nowadays free.

I'd feel like anyone else.

If the art you are making doesn't give you enough intrinsic value then you should stop making art, I am sorry you can't afford that gold plated toilet because I am not going to buy your album from 1993.
I only pirate pornography because I don't want to fund exploitation.
Are you a pirate?Yep, I live in Somalia and take international vessels hostage. Perhaps one day Seal Team Six will kill me and make a movie about it.
I pirate what is not available to legally buy in my country.
I think I would base my reaction on how well the content was liked.Like if my shit was Pirated, but people loved it and it became popular, Id be ok. Might even encourage me to continue the project/future projects.If they hated it, then fuck em, it's not like they paid for it.
The guy with all the machines named after 2hus right? Or is there another one.

1. yes2. I have written software that a bunch of people buy already, it is my job to make it hard or difficult to pirate, or to otherwise incentivize purchasing, but I don't want people put in jail for it. I really don't give a shit.
Man, I always pirate games, but they were usually old games I didn't feel guilty about.I just recently upgraded my computer and pirated GTAV immediately. Now that I'm playing a modern triple A title I kinda feel bad about myself.
I hope you're not saying all taxation is stealing, because it does often provide benefits for the public good.Saying taxes are one thing, does not mean it isn't another thing."I hope you aren't saying that ice cream causes diabetes, because it tastes like fruit"
I release what I create on to websites for publicity I don't give a fuck shitposter
Pretty fine. If they care enough to check it out then that's pretty cool. Maybe someone will like it enough to purchase legally or donate or something. That's assuming I'm even selling it. Everything I've ever worked on, I've distributed for free under various free licenses. For most of my own projects I use the WTFPL because it fits nicely into my purposes. If I really cared about the work I put into something, I could see myself licensing things under GPL
Answer me OP, do you actually get paid to make this shit thread or do you do it for free?Im just curious.If first is yes then is it your only job or do you do it like while working in mcdonalds over your phone or something?else if second is yes then are you butthurt artist or programmer or worse are you a complete retard with no profit in this anyhow.Please answer these I need to know.
It's stealing if I take it and they don't have it. It's copying if I have it and they also have it. The notion of piracy is simply idiots struggling with the notion of a digital infinitely reproducible commodity.
All property is theft, you can't own digital property
It's still theft. It's an involuntary removal of money you earn made legal due to legislation.But yes, what it provides only it can do.
people steal ideas all the timepeople take these ideas and try to make money off of them. I mean shit, all the fucking movies looks like they've been sources straight from reddit or 4chan. its the nature of businessI can only blame myself for not keeping piracy in mind when I am making my product
have you met writers? they literally do nothing but 'research' things on the internet all day the only reason they don't make entire movies about memes is that it would be too obvious and some people don't use the internet so it would be alienating
Fellow owners of these kinds of stacked fin heatsinks, share your sad stories and regrets.How many times have you cut yourself on the edges?Who thought wedging rubber stoppers between the fins was a good way to mount the fan?How bad was the dust buildup the last time you cleaned?Today I took mine apart to clean, thick cake of dust between the fan and the fins, layers of dust between the fins, dust around the pipes. It was horrifying. After I reinstalled my load temps dropped by 8C.
Water-cooled and never looking back.  Fuck heatsinks.
 he isn't using the best cooler ever:^
Custom or AIO?i've bought three different AIOs and each were faulty on arrivalsaid fuck it and slapped a hyper 212 evo on my cpu, never have looked backcustom seems like way too much effort/risk/cost
Not him, but u sure about those faulty AIOs? u didn't plug the pump into the cpu fan header, right?
Guy you responded to here.  I have a Kraken X40 from NZXT.  Only have it because I won it in a website giveaway.  But I love it.  I'm gonna do a custom one next time around.
I'm thinking of getting a Hyper 212X Turbo for $35.35USD, but the Seidon 120V sells for $51.89USD here and has vastly superior temps according to tests, 2 of my friends have it and they seem pretty silent even with the shitty stock fan.Wut do? I don't feel like paying near $100 for a Noctua or some other huge abomination with 14cm fans as those are expensive and hard to obtain.
my fins are thick enough to not cut memy case have air filters, almost no dust therei guess i don't have any sad stories to tellisn't wc basically an heatsink with extension cord to put it in place with better airflow/colder air?
So what is the best cooler for around 50 bucks?I don't really know how to choose.
What kind of autistic fuck cuts him self on a heatsinc. I have been using them for ages and haven't cut my self.
Off the top of my head the be quiet! dark rock 3 sells for around 49.99as the name may or may not suggest it's quiet and keeps your shit cool.
Got one of these for free, cant wait to use it in a build. Was also using a hyper 212 on my current rig but swapped for a cheap h100i I found. That hyper kept my 2500k @ 4.5ghz under 65c, damn impressive
Tried shipping my computer with the heatsink still attached.Horrible idea, retention mechanism was so weak the thing snapped off the motherboard due to the rough handling.It's a miracle only the heatsink was damaged.
shilling
that looks really nice
I've been using the cryorig h7 and it not only looks really good but performs decently for the price. I've also moved my pc around recently and had no issues with the mounting
honestly, any thing that isn't way over the top xbox hueg and weighing a couple pounds will be fine, heck anything with a proper backplate should be fine too.
I had a 212 Evo. Was fine, no problems. Then I decided to do a mini-ITX build and apparently MSI can't into 120mm fans with their PCI and cpu placement. So, I got a h90 and it's doing maybe 5 degrees cooler.
How many times have you cut yourself on the edges?NeverWho thought wedging rubber stoppers between the fins was a good way to mount the fan?What?How bad was the dust buildup the last time you cleaned?Not that bad because i dont live outside
One time I installed one and it kept my cpu cool no regrets0 timeswhat?a few months worthyou should maintain your pc before it gets that bad
Hyper 212 installactual heatsink installation goes finego to slide fans back oncut the ever living fuck out of myself trying to hold the heatsink while I slid the first fan into placeliteral blood drops all over my VRM heatsinkleft them there as a testament to the horrors that took place that day
Bought a PH-TC14PE for $54Best purchase ever. It'll last forever and gives temps just as good as the $99 top tier noctua fan without blocking a PCIe. Dead quiet, too. Based Phanteks.
the Be Quiet! Dark Rock Pro 3?
I think I know why AMD can't compete.Their CEO is a woman.
Really? That explains everythang.
Sarcasm, Anon?
Ugh...
At least this time they're only going to stick the tip in instead of the whole thing, right?
So this is actually a good thing, which is weird considering that any act with "freedom" or "liberty" or something like that in the name is usually bad.
This is awful, it renews and reforms the patriot act section 215 instead of letting it expire at midnight like our freedom demands
No, this is terrible. It extends the provisions of the Patriot Act.
It's a bad thing, there's very little good that will come from this.
Can't stand these people.
What exactly does it do? Do you have a link where I can read up about it?

I'm not reading all of that, I'm not a lawyer. I mean is there a link or several that summarize it?
The other "smarter" bush came out in support of the patriot act apparently as well.
fantasy
This guy goes through the text and points out some of the problems with it.
Fall in line, slaves. You wouldn't want us to find child porn on your computers, now would you?
They extended it.There's nothing to stop the endless and increasing flow of bad legislation which speeds our decent into some Orwellian nightmare. It will continue regardless of our effort.They can work around all the rules and are many times more educated than your average citizen, they seek only self interest and power.It's hopeless.
What is the Patriot Act and why is it bad/good?
which is weird considering that any act with "freedom" or "liberty" or something like that in the name is usually bad.This blatantly unconstitutional bill is no exception.
The freedom act is basically a privatized version of the patriot act. The bulk collection will continue like before the only difference is they wont bother with phones anymore. All the other data will be collected by private agencies and up for grabs as long as they have a nod and a wink from a secretive court no one oversees.
the patriot act allows the nsa to collect everything without a warrant and store itno part of it is good or helpful
Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both.
Paul currently speaking to block itas of 7:41pm eastern
is this one of those filibuster things?
I hope he takes a few copies of it, tears them to pieces and shoves the paper scraps down those authoritarians' throats.
Technically it DOESN'T allow that according to a federal circuit court. The NSA went beyond the intended scope of the bill because no one was paying attention to what they were doing. That goes to show you how well these secret courts work.
He is the hero America needs.
Reminder that /pol/ shitlords actually support conservative politicians like these. They're so butthurt about faggots and trannies having equal rights that they're willing to drag everybody's privacy through the mud just to be spiteful.
Fuck you, Mitt.
/pol/ is full of edgy teens.  I once went in there, just to see what the fuss is about, first thread was "times you went full /pol/ in public" AKA "those times you actually let slip you were a wannabe nazi"It was fairly pathetic, at least stand by your politics.
"Conservatards are the answer!"Sure, let's just shit all over other civil liberties in the process of trying to repeal the Patriot Act.
Better than the other option
Implying they didn't just give a gorillian dollars to Australia to spy on us and give them the info or they're going to blatantly do whatever the fuck they want anyways. This is theater and faggot posturing.
vote libertarian, shitheads
Wow, why is America such a shithole?
the other optiontheThis is exactly where your problem lies. Vote green, communist, Tea Party, anything other than your usual choices of right wing conservatives.
freedom of speech is objectively the most important human freedom that exists. If you have freedom of speech, you can campaign for more rights.fuggin consebatives, id much rather be able to freely gargle cocks than share free softwareYou're an idiot.
It is mostly a symbolic gesture but it does at least mean it's harder for them to make use of anything they find. It also means the NSA wouldn't have all the funding they've come to expect so it could possibly be harder for them to maintain their giant data center.
wrong, it's the right to bear arms
It would be better if we just voted hamburgers into office instead of eating them.
freedom of speech is objectively the most important human freedom that exists.You are literally using objectively wrong, and you're actually wrong yourself as well. Freedom of speech is not even in the top 3 most important freedoms.
Can someone explain what this is going to do/change? I've read some of the links posted and still don't get it.
PATRIOT ActUSA Freedom ActHopefully when an asteroid finally wipes out 90% of the life on this planet, it hits the United States first and is aptly called "1776 Liberation".
Enlighten me, what are the most important freedoms? Sure, the freedom to be alive is nice, but without speech you can't complain that maybe other liberties might be nice too.
funny thing is every other country does all this shit worse than murica doesat least we bitch about it
1. right to bear arms
This is actually wrong and a classic American propaganda talking point."Everyone else does it as well!" The thing is, no they don't you fucking retard. Some countries like the UK are doing it. Most of them in fact aren't.
1  All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.2 Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.3 No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.Now that I think of it, I don't think freedom of speech ranks even in the top 5.
Shit nigger, as opposed to figuratively using it wrong? "Objectively" is a common buzzword, and is used as hyperbole in that case.
You're listing the definition for the word freedom.
naw it's trueI'm not american.
Except that's not true, we're allowed to be very critical of our governments without fear of a gagging order.  The US is a farce, you have no press freedoms, it's the most agenda driven reporting in the first world.  Your police have killed 2 people every day for the last 5 months.  Religious idiots blame everything on homosexuals, which while being amusing in a "le ebin maymay" sense, it's factually incorrect.  The NRA is enabling idiots who can't pour themselves a drink without soiling themselves to own rifles, and you wonder why the rest of the world thinks the US is fucked?You yanks should be terrified, your government is out to get you.- READ THIS.
There is literally nothing wrong with both nationalism and socialism.  It's all in how you phrase it.
sure is nice living in glorious yuropian utopia where my government doesn't spy on me and i have more than two practically identical choices in each electionstay irrelevant murica
Patriot Act: Program Set to Expire at Midnight Despite Senate Voting to Advance Surveillance ProgramsThe Senate approved the legislation Sunday, but it will not reach President Obama's desk until after the midnight deadline, The Hill reports. Senate objections hindered the program's extension.
YuropCCTV on every street cornerMuslim immigrants out the assSharia zones
Nationalisation = NazisSocialism = CommiesSeriously, it only kinda works in moderation, but those ideologies attract idiots who cannot into moderation, thus, /pol/ is a shitpit of wannabe nazis who are terrified of the world, keyboard warriors in their own little fucked up version of tumblr style hugboxery.
So you're saying as long as they let you be alive and they don't torture you, you're free? Sounds like Brave New World to me, bud.
yurop equals UKamerican education
Sharia zonesWhere are these?  I know they've tried to set them up, but they're not recognized legally anywhere but their own sandy shitcunt countries.
That's not Yurop dumbfuck.
f-franklin?
Oh sorry forgot about swedensocial justice out the ass
your government lets you ramble about muh freedoms while you living in total shit as a wageslave for the global elitethis is the pinnacle of TRUE freedomYou're fucked in the head pal
UK and Germany are the only countries in Yurop that matter. Both of those countries are worse than the US. Hell, whatever shithole you're from  is as well, which is why you don't even want to reveal it.
Accepting bets on how long it takes for crypto researchers to start getting arrested/export restrictions on crypto to start being taken seriously/mandated backdoors in crypto schemes.I hate the fact that seriously considering the possibility of any of the above despite having happened in the past/have been pushed by a variety of officials makes you sound like a tinfoil to most people.
There is plenty wrong with both.Socialism is the amazing idea that the political elite know what you want and need better than you do.Nationalism is the act of worshiping and taking pride in something that does not exist. Nationalization is a core part of socialism.Yes, Franklin.
everyone else does it!Maybe if you keep repeating it enough it will come true = ^ 
France also has their own patriot act thing too now.
mfw murrika is full of jewish ghettosmost cities also have a chinatown and a japantownvast swathes of cities are pretty much no go zones for white peoplecops more likely to shoot you than help youyeah, murrika is full of PROUD PATRIOTIC mexic... no, puerto ric... no, chines... no, ah fuck it, you're a mutt of a nation, and you call out other nations for immigration?

just the tip
you're a mutt of a nationthat's the point
Atleast in Murrica I can shoot those faggots.
implying there wouldn't be a revolution at some pointPeople are retarded, but they're not that stupid. If you have free speech, you can organize, inspire, and overthrow corrupt governments. It just takes a scandal and a rallying cry.
disgustingthe difference between America and yogurt is that if you leave yogurt alone for 200 years it'll grow a culturewith America you get a freakshow of muh irish-scottish-fenno-swede-russian ancestry
But you don't have a freedom to organize
with America you get a freakshow of muh irish-scottish-fenno-swede-russian ancestrythat's literally how the country started
Corruption is a separate issue and socialism doesn't have a monopoly on that.I don't understand why people insist either nationalism or socialism or both is inherently authoritarian and unduly restricts freedom.Unduly being the operative word.  Government by its nature restricts freedom to some extent.
with America you get a freakshow of muh irish-scottish-fenno-swede-russian ancestryI don't see the problem with that, sounds pretty cool.
Without any context, it would almost seem as if this is a good thing, coming from the EFF
I once went in thereWow you are such a hero, dumb rebbitor.
So a tl;dr for a dirty foreign terrorist that wants to take your life and liberty. Is the mass collection shit death or not?
Well EFF likes it
I've been told by an american that St. Patricks Day, the day dedicated to the patron saint of Ireland, is an American thing.  Not Irish, it's American.  The level of stupidity, is outstanding.
That was probably intended.
Did you have a point to make?
Voting against these "anti-terror" bills is political suicide.  If you vote against them, you will get slaughtered on the next election cycle.  Your political opponents would make TV commercials like "Candidate X supports TERROR.  He voted AGAINST the anti-terror act of 2015.  He doesn't care about the safety and liberty of your CHILDREN."So you have career politicians, politicians who vote things in because of bribes, riders, etc.  Nobody could even begin to tackle how broken the system in because it's too far gone.  There's nothing any of us can do about it.
this is exactly the attitude that causes this shit to keep happening
Most places are gerrymandered so hard it really doesn't matter what these people vote for anymore. Look at Dianne Frankenstein she's extremely unpopular but she's been in congress consecutively for like 20 years or something.
Who said anything about corruption?Do you know what socialism is? You can't have socialism without authoritarianism as long as the state exists. The more socialism you implement, the more power and authority the state has. You can't nationalize something without giving more authority to the government. It's not a binary switch where you have either full blown authoritarian socialism like Nazi Germany or a complete anarchy. It's a spectrum. Every time you go toward socialism, you also go toward authoritarianism. The only way to have socialism without authoritarianism is to have socialism without the state. Eg communism or red anarchy.And stop using vague terms like unduly. What are you, some kind of a moral arbiter? Who the fuck defines what unduly is? You?
It has a provision called "sneak and peak" where cops can brake into your home, install listening devices, and never tell you. Indefinitely. They can do this if they get the permission from a secret court whose judges are not known and whose decisions are automatically classified. This court has only once said no to a warrant request.The NSA can collect any and all phone metadata or internet transmissions for any American "person" as long as they have "reasonable suspicion" that "person" is up to no good or may know someone who is up to no good. "Person" is in quotes because it actually means individual or corporation. They have already used this to name "Verizon" as a person and collect metadata and data for all of Verizon's customers not like it was just Verizon, the did this with all the other internet/phone providers too.Email communication is not defined as being protected by the 4th amendment and after 6 months the NSA has blanket permission to read the contents of any emails they collect.I wish I was making any of this up.This is what is going to be extended tonight.
Reminder that you don't know what you're talking about./pol/ is against the patriot and freedom act/pol/45908296/pol/45910142/pol/45910401
Nationalization is a core part of socialism.No it isn't.This is also untrue. You don't have to put the state in charge of the means of production AKA nationalization. A libertarian socialist state is perfectly possible.
And what does the new Act does?
Exact same thing. Now they store it at the telcos instead of their own servers
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO GET THEIR LEGS BLOWN OFF BEFORE YOU START TO BELIEVE THE SAND MONKEYS HATE US
It's not totally wrong.  It's not celebrated in Ireland the same way it's celebrated in the US.
where I live there are dozens of arabs that look like they were drugged and beat into accepting islam, who openly say shit like 'death to america' in front of their friends. the FBI really needs to investigate people like this
muh freedumbmuh siva liburteesI think /g/ really only cares because they're afraid their weirdo loli pictures will one day count as illegal porn. Honestly, can you name any significant harm caused by the NSA program? Not one example is ever provided of it being abused to harm an innocent citizen, but 50+ terrorist attacks have been prevented due to the program. You assholes really sicken me. You rather LET PEOPLE DIE than have the government know you like to jerk it to Chinese cartoons, but then you come on here and BRAG ABOUT IT ANYWAY.I used to think people against the program were just trolls, but after seeing Reddit praise Snowden as some kind of hero and not just the celebrity seeking attention whore that he is, I realized that perhaps some of these people are serious. This 20-something asshole wants to prop himself up like some kind of Thomas Jefferson and the liberals are more than willing to contribute to his delusional fantasies.
but 50+ terrorist attacks have been prevented due to the program[Citation needed]
It's a sad day when the dumbasss rep from my dumbass state is doing a better job than anything the other 49 can muster.This is like a Pinto winning Nascar.  This fucking state, the best and worst.
I knew someone was going to ask for a citation and act like a smart-ass in doing so. I had them ready. I bet you feel like a real idiot now.
It's needed to defend our country.What makes you think it isn't you NEET weeaboo. Not everyone hoards illegal content on their thinkpads, fucking loser.Seriously.I want the full act back, makes me feel more secure knowing osama aint doing shit to my beautiful country.
Not the same anon, but I was going to ask the same question, and feel happy to have the information.
Hahah, you stupid nigger. A few months after that it came out that those were misleading claims. again NSA shill.
That seems slightly contradictory to the www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/21/fbi-admits-patriot-act-snooping-powers-didnt-crack/ I saw a few days ago.
People here say it's bad.But isn't the EFF saying it's good? The EFF are the good guys, right?So is it good or bad? I'm not American, I don't know shit about your news.
they said they didn't catch shit
EFF thinks it's a step in the right direction but they still don't really like it.
You should try switching to a new IP before samefagging.
nice tryI'm not samefagging. I honestly believe that the only reason /g/ cares is because 90% of you idiots are anime watching pedos.
Because any government tasked with ruling over an area and a population of that scale is bound to fall into dysfunction and corruption.
bin Ladin laughs at the entire Western world from beyond the grave.The terrorists have won.
Is it bad I want the government to start black bagging people just because I didn't get laid enough in school?
Get fucked, fascist.

Fucking politiciansthem and their fallaciesad hominem is not how to justify your shit actions
retards.
jews are behind all of this. 9/11 was Mossad and they own all of the TSA security contracts. The end goal is to treat Americans like they do Palestinians in a security police state
muh juice conspiracy
Daily reminder that all of the data NSA scoops up about you is shared in the raw with Israel
Hi /pol/
It's amazing that you're so stupid that you don't understand the point they were making. They were saying that Americans care about it more. See also: Cinco de Mayo.
prove it...they haven't, they won't, they can't.
this is blatantly false. most of /pol/ cares about freedom and privacy.

anyone who doesn't like the government fucking you in the ass is a pedo!unironically supporting the Patriot actJust end your life.
wait what the fuck actually happened
What does that mean?advanced USA FreedomDeclared war on China? Russia?
trying this hard to be clever
Politics happened. You're welcome.
What use is privacy if the terrorists win? If they smuggle a nuke into a port, what use is not being spied on to those people who were obliterated?Liberty is not worth more than death. The founding fathers did not believe that liberty is worth dying for, especially in a world where having it is a real threat to your safety.
He's right. /pol/ is hella libertarian
The founding fathers did not believe that liberty is worth dying forExcept that's exactly what they believed.
One piece of vitally missing context is that the people getting their legs blown off are in the sand monkey's neighborhoods shooting people.Osama Bin Laden's plan to defeat america was not to scare it into surrendering, it was to scare america into destroying itself. The idea was to get america to be so scared of some ooga boogas in caves that it would spend so much money on a military to try and root them out that the country will collapse.Why is this his plan? Because it's what he did to the soviet union.
When they said "Liberty or death" they meant "Liberty to prevent death".If you need to give up liberty to prevent death because technology forces that change, then it should be done.
The fuck just happened. I'm seeing some reports that it died and others that a reform passed, both from reputable sources. I wish I was home so I could just be watching this shit on Cspan.
ad hominem is not how to justify your shit actionsthank you, 4chan user :^
My view of it is that nothing really changed. You're aware that the NSA hires out contractors to do a lot of their work, right?Well these contractors pay lobbyists to make sure that these NSA programs stay running. And these lobbyists pay politicians- and this pay goes to them keeping their jobs. The politician who doesn't collect money gets to find a new job.
That's not what the history textbooks will say.
implying i give a fuck about privacy, liberty, etc.
It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!
So are any other countries more lenient when it comes to privacy? Doesn't seem like it except maybe Canada. I want to wake up from this Orwellian nightmare, it's becoming too real.
well you're not arguing with me, you're arguing with a generation raised to think that liberty is not important.
This is because their parents never forced them to eat their vegetables, right?
My approach is to link liberty with the stability of a nation. All the illusions of safety in the world won't save you when you run out of money to pay for the safety. I consider garbage collection to be more important than national spying.Why not take the money and spend it on education?One thing that's glossed over is how much it costs to spy on americans. It costs a huge amount.
implying that people actually have any of these three in the US generally anyway kek
Se7en came out so long ago.
LolololBait thread.215 expired. So did lone wolf and roving wiretaps.The 77-17 vote was a cloture vote to end the democrat filibuster.

not so fast
All human beings are born freeEveryone has the right to libertyYou can't possibly be free if you can't even speak your mind freely.To say that "freedom" and "liberty" are paramount, but freedom of speech is unimportant is asinine. You're just using words with a positive sound, and meaning nothing by them.
/pol/ is a bunch of edgy teenagers who want to pretend they are superior in intellect to their peers by taking contrarian stances, Not to mention the board has literally been co-opted by Stormfront. Still never understood why Moot never deleted /pol/ after several months when it was obvious it was turning the rest of 4chan into a political shit fight especially /int/ and /v/ and was swarmed almost instantly by Stormfront users and bots.
Nationalization is a core part of socialism.Only Marxist Leninism which is State-Capitalism by their own admission.Most Socialist strains of thought advocate federations of Worker Cooperatives.
Hey, at least it's on hold until Senate reconvenes Monday.
Against what? Your neighbor? The drug dealer down the street?What kind of delusion makes you think you could actually fight for change with violence? Where did this fantasy come from? Who told you these lies? Big Brother shows up on your doorstep and you're going to blow him away with your silly little semi-auto rifles? He's got more men than you do, and each of them has more guns than you do, and those guns are a lot better than anything you could afford, let alone get access to.The only people one could reasonably bear arms against are such a small blip on the radar that the cost of owning and maintaining guns outweighs their benefits unless you're hunting your own food, even then it's suspect. Most people get through their whole lives without being robbed, burgled, assaulted, held up, or otherwise engaged in a confrontation where lethal force is necessary to protect themselves.
Nationalization is a core part of socialism.Only to Statists, and those guys are morons.
1/3 of american households have gunsgovernment has more peoplewhatever you say buddy
this is what people who watch tv news actually believe
Did you really think it would be so easy?
You're going to collect a disorganized militia and convince them to hole up in some shitheap to resist the government, when the government can just have some nerds in the Pentagon's basement fly a half-dozen drones over your compound and slaughter every one of your "rebel fighters"? Really?Even if you could rally a single percent a million men, if your statistic is correct of gun owners behind your cause, they're scattered across the entire US, and at least half of them would be poorly trained or otherwise a liability. How are you going to get them and all their guns together? It's rebel power fantasy.

Interesting. Feels like I'm living in the future for a change.

KB3035583 installs an agent that automatically collects a list of your installed apps and devices.  It also nags you to register for windows 10.In short, MS is now pushing spyware through windows updates.
They should have left this closer to the release time.
installing optional updatesYou asked for this, retard
abloobloo muh privacyNobody cares.
MS makes a non-botnet browsermakes a botnet OS insteadTh-thanks based Microsoft
You're already using Windows, Google and and other bullshit. Like it makes a difference.
I recently found that my hard drive was running at 100% all the time and that the rundll32.exe process was eating a lot of memory. Found out Windows installed an update that does exactly what is mentioned in OP's post. Deactivated it because I never accepted anything to do this, M$ should at least show a notification for that shit.
post more ISIS-chan
what are you doin installing optional updates? are you retarded?
Nah, they made it a recommended update.implying you don't generally want the security updates
im looking at it right fucking now its in the optional updates list only
Thanks for the warning. Not like it was ever going to be installed anyway though, I haven't done any updates since I reinstalled Windows over a year and a half ago.Update comes up under Important and Recommended for me.
not doing ANY updatetrusting a fresh windows installationI really hope for you that this PC isn't connected to the internet buddy.
For Windows 7. On 8.1 it's a recommended update.
SpywareLiterally just letting their base target audience, dumb people, know what's upYou're all always do extremist in your paranoia.
its not, i post using a fax
You obviously haven't used Win8.1, they pinned the fucking shop automatically on the taskbar.I have not seen a more desperate company in a long time. They're drowning and it's fun as hell to watch.
Hi. Please post address, credit card details, blood type and semen sample.
Why wouldn't I want to register for Windows 10?
What happens for my boxed copy ? Can I "reserve" windows 10 and install it on my next PC this summer ? Or should I wait until I got my PC before reserving it ? I really hope MS doesn't fuck up on OEM and boxed copies, I'd be pissed if my w10 was tied to a single machine.
You think that's new?  They have been doing that shit since at least windows 98, son.
strong
comes out next month...
Nope Basically doing their best since 1999
Windows 7 to 10Is it worth it ? Because I actually have no reasons to change my OS as it does everything I need already.
Then don't do it. Unless you want some performance boost.
I'll be switching to W10.Had this installation running since I bought the laptop so I would've re-installed regardless, and since W10 is a thing, I might as well.
7 is shit OS move already to 8.1
Yea, i've been wanting to get a new SSD for a while. May as well do it when 10 comes out. Old SSD to the laptop and reformat that too. THe battery life on the 10 tech preview is insanely better than 7 was
don't do it
Don't listen to Katsura.
 this triggers the digital pirate
not buying CDs
The only thing triggering me is baby boomers making political cartoons about things they don't understand, like net neutrality.
implying live performance don't produce more money than album sales
This.Except where cases of DRM in CDs are concerned, I support the artist.I rarely buy dvds anymore and just pirate a good movie if I see it on tv or in the theater.Fuck DRM
Literally every song ever is on youtube
I prefer physical media to take with and even rip to FLAC for archiving and listening.
buying CDsgood goy
I met one of my favourite musicians on a cruise once, and she said that she didn't mind piracy."I don't get paid per copy, and [label] already makes a lot of money."
This cartoonis Bullshit.If you want to support the artist go to a concert and buy merch99% of the time CD sales only mostly just put money in the pockets of the label, not the artist.
but that's not really the same. the violinist is asking for donations, not selling a CD. even that would be flawed, but it would be less flawed.
I bet that violinist didn't get permission to use that song for public performances, so he's a pirate too.
buying cdsnot buying superior vinylsplebcore
not true btw
This comic somehow represents real life problems
buying CDssupporting a dead formatNigga if you aren't going to use spotify and you insist on being a buyfag at least use itunes
I like to rip my youtube music to FLAC too but that is not the point.the point is that pirating and stealing from the legit owner of the art is not really fair.Would you like that somebody steal your car?
itunesok, now I'm triggered
if they magically made a copy of my car I wouldn't give a fuck.
Deal with it nerd, it has the best selection
vinylsTriggered.
CD is still way betteruncompressed audiotons of physical shit like booklets and art on the casecan listen on any digital player made in the last 30 yearsAll for the same price of an iTunes album.
Not liking the unique sound of vinyl.fucking 2000 kids dont know the good stuff anymore
uncompressed audiotons of physical shit like booklets and art on the casenot pirating FLAC ripsnot downloading booklet scans
I would buy CDs if they weren't ridiculously overpriced inb4 poorfag
I wait for the day you guys will mature and see that if everybody would pirate there would be nothing to pirate because ppl couldnt live of it.Welp but I talk to a 12yr old kid which doesnt understand the market
I rip youtube music to FLACYou enjoy creating larger files for no reason?
falling for obvious b8, welcome newfriend take a look at everything and learn.
thinking that there's a "market"not taking what you want when you wantbeing a buyfag
I buy music. It just happens to immediately get ripped and uploaded to what.cd for delicious upload credit
nice b8 m8 I r8 it 8/8
i tried itunes.... and it sucked.I don't want to buy songs that can't be shared on other devices. That's why I support cd's.I bought music from google play and I hate it that I can't share my songs.
Love the sound of vinyl records. Hate when people call them "vinyls." Might as well post a picture of you listening to some shitty tumblrcore on a shitty crosley.
I dont even understand what you talking about.
rip my CDs to 128 Kbpsconvert to FLACupload onto public trackerpeople leave comments thanking me for uploading in FLAC and how much better they soundThe placebo is real.
this triggers the digital pirateIt's a caricature. It's sole purpose is to appeal to people whose thought process does not adhere to conventional reason.
lol placebo memeThere is an audible difference between lossy and lossless, but there is a point where lossy becomes transparent. 128 kbps MP3s are very audible, but 192+ kbps is arguably transparent to most listeners. 128 kbps sounds completely washed out.Regardless, I rip all of my CDs to lossless backups so I can burn 1:1 copies in the event the original disc is damaged. The only time I bother to downcode music to lossy formats is if I'm putting files on devices with space constraints, like maybe a portable MP3 player.As for downloading music, ideally I'd like to have it in lossless format so I can burn a 1:1 reproduction of the disc. There's no point in downcoding it to lossy, then having to upcode it back to Redbook standard. Each time you do that, there's going to be an accumulating data loss that will become quite audible somewhere down the line.This is why there are applications like CUEtools and AccurateRip. You can verify the checksums against AccurateRip's database to make sure the files match those on the physical disc. If you downcode something to a lossy format, then turn around and upcode it to FLAC, the CRCs will no longer match.
The autism is real.
uwotm8
Are you kidding me! What the fuck! Apple engages in price fixing. ITunes is bloated crap. I can't get my songs in FLAC for archival and long term storage. And Apple has been known to delete songs they lose the rights to. Same for spotify. Fuck that shit. I refuse to suck the cooperate cock no matter how appealing their mp3 covered member may appear I will own my media or will not partake. The only cock I will suck is that of the great RMS. For freedom and rights are the only future worth sacrificing for. I will not compromise to be had on the terms of another. If I am to be had it will be on my terms. Fuck off you cooperate shill.
best post so far
This tbh. For my pleb ears i consider everything beyond 256kbps to be fine. I only bother with flacs if there's no other high quality encoding available.
you can make money and still have a job on the sideyou seem to think people should treat art like a job. so fuck you
By that logic playing a song from youtube which doesn't go to the artist's affiliations is stealing. Walk past the bum and play the same song through your phone, using youtube, and you've stolen his lunch.Nobody complains about all the free music you can listen to and get from Youtube, but for some reason torrenting is a big no-no.Logically either Youtube needs to remove the material, as they are facilitating piracy, or piracy is already accepted as a victimless crime to some extent.
I buy LPs for the bigger, prettier cover art.Then I download the album digitally to put on my devices.CDs are fucking useless.
tfw both the kid and the violonist are pirates
/thread
what's scary is that there are copyright lawyers/content owners who actually think that.
mfw I buy used CD's on ebay and rip them to mp3and there is nothing you can do to stop me
Daily reminder that you can't support piracy without being a hypocrite if you support private property, the backbone of capitalismI'd also like to point out the difference between a finished product that is for sale and a concept, patent, musical score, etc., before someone brings that up.
yeah you can support private property and piracy anon. the music industry has to switch tactics, which they should. they make money these days off live performances rather than how many CDs they sell and nobody has died as a result. stop believing the bullshit the RIAA and other groups like the MPAA tell you.
Exactly this. If you're not a touring musician then you deserve to starve.If you are a touring musician, then enjoy your Bentley. What's the problem here? Can't pirate an experience.
People in the music industry *do* complain about youtube. But, fair point.Musicians have given in to music piracy. "Well, you can't pirate a live show!" Piracy is now a means of exposure.I know firsthand of a few deliberate leaks with that mindset.
what's scary is that there are copyright lawyers/content owners who actually think that.It is true.
Wasn't there a study that found music pirates to be some of the heaviest consumers of concert tickets and merchandise?
hobo with a violin Way to bend over backward to drive home your point, cartoonist.
The point is what can or should be private property asshole.
I would buy CDs if they weren't ridiculously overpricedBut I need to buy food!
consumers of concert tickets and merchandise?That is where the real money comes from, most money for buying songs/cds goes to the big music labels anyway, not the artist.
So, about a week and a half ago I asked you useless fuckers for mouse suggestions.All you did was berate me for using a Logitech BJ58 for years.  Then there were a trickle of recommendations.I bought a Steelcase Sensei.  $50.  What a pile of shit!  Their drivers are absolutely appalling.  The click resistance was completely inconsistent between the two main buttons, and the click of the wheel was *extremely* hard.  One-way ticket to RSI.I did some more research.  Found old recommendations for the Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical.  I ordered one off eBay for $8, shipping included.$8 fucking dollars and it's a better experience than the $50 "gaming" mouse.  The buttons have excellent click feel, the scrollwheel is nice, and the middle click is barely harder than the main buttons.  Plus, the new Microsoft mouse management software is really slick, and works WAY better than the shitty, HTML-embedded-window Steelcase drivers.So fuck you, you useless fuckers, and if you need a new mouse, check out the classic Wheel Mouse Optical X80 OEM, I think or X08 non-OEM.
Subscribed! Do you have an RSS feed? I would love to sync your blog feed to my phone to read offline!
he bought a laser mousekill yourself
I don't get it though. Why wouldn't you just buy a Logitech G400; cheaper and better than the Steelseries.
Get that cheap etekcity mouse on Amazon. It's great coming from a MX518 whore like myself.And the cord is braided so it's strong enough to hang yourself with
Should have purchased an Intellimouse Optical over the Wheel Mouse Optical.It remains the only mouse that matters.
I have a SteelSeries Sensei and don't have little bitch fingers so I love it.
braided cords are fucking shit no matter what.
Why wouldn't you just buy a Logitech G400Not ambidextrous.Intellimouse OpticalI'll look into it.  Sounds like it's larger good and heavier bad.  I like the side button, though.  Looks like the Wheel Mouse Optical 1.1 and the Intellimouse use the same "Intellieye Engine" sensor.I'm prone to tendinitis.  Good for you, though, I'm glad you paid $50 for a mediocre mouse, terrible software, and top-notch marketing.
Oh, it's right-handed only.  Fuck that noise.
zowie
Dude you've been posting this in every halfway relevant most thread for like two weeks
You figured it out op, dint listen to /mkg/ for keyboard recs either, the ibm rt3200 is the best price/performance you can get, and also trackpoint
Good for him.  None of you useless fuckers suggested the Microsoft optical mice when I needed info.
Anyone tried mionix naos 7000 or 8200?Looks like just what I need, a simple and good mouse with a comfortable shape, the lack of buttons is a turnoff though and who knows about built quality, I'm pretty sick of gaymer mice that doesn't even last half a year.
All you did was berate me for using a Logitech BJ58 for years.I bought a Steelcase Sensei. $50. What a pile of shit!OP does it again
What semi-gaming mice are there for claw grip?
How is the tracking?
Implying that there is anything wrong with the simple Logitech that gave 14 years of great ergonomic service.
the ibm rt3200 is the best price/performance you can getI'm actually very intrigued by this keyboard.  Never heard of it before.  I'm skeptical of the I guess membrane keys, though.
I have that keyboard. I used it as my main for a while, but I went back to my mechanical. I still use it while on my couch, and it works amazingly for that.
What sort of mechanical?  How would you compare the feel?I seem to remember that, back in the day, IBM switched to a membrane style keyboard for the PS/2 computers.  At least, the later models.  I don't recall disliking them, though I'd typed for a few years on the Model M clickety-clack keyboards already.
I use browns, but I want to try blues. The membrane keys on that board are not the worst, but they are definitely mushier than mechanical switches. The rollover also wasn't the best for gaming.
There's buttons on both sides, it's an ambidextrous mouse.
razer top gayman productshonestly what a piece of shit, it developed a problem where it randomly dies and has to be unplugged and plugged in again
the fucks all over your mouse?
This.I use my mouses into oblivion. I had a Sidewinder x5 for 4 years that I took apart to fix, and after seeing picks of teardowns on the internet I was expecting it to be full of dust. Almost nothing.And all the fucking mice covered with gunk...How the fuck does that happen? What are they fucking doing to it?
Dude my autism would rage if I had so much shit on my mouse.clean keyboard every week or twoclean mouse when I see a glimpse of residue on it.clean screens at least once per month.Is it too much autism?
I had a Lachesis I bought after I gave my amazing Diamondback away. It started moving vertically only until I unplug and re-plug it back in. I'm convinced this is either a combination of shitty drivers on their part or sub-par sensors. Either way I spent ~$90 on a piece of shit that broke within a year and a half. I purchased the D'back in fucking 2009 and it still works perfectly.Holy shit has Razer gone downhill since the early Diamonback days. Whatever coating they use is fucking awful and flakes off within a few months of standard use, it also builds up dirt like crazy.In comparison to my Logitech and old D'back it was the worst mouse I've ever bought and the sole reason I'll never spend money on any Razer product ever again.
this mouse would have been suggested sarcastically, if you must have a gaymer mouse, go for the deathadder
I bought a Steelcase Sensei. $50. What a pile of shit!I have a Sensei raw and have had no problems. Considering I just bought a 4K screen I'll probably never be able to go back to something under 1600dpi, let alone a shitty optical
You are fucking disgusting
is a trackball really worth getting? they look quite cool but is it worth buying over a normal mouse?
Tell me what is a good mice to buy, currently using cm xornet and feeling it's not sufficient and inaccurate. I got around 30-35$ to "spend".
If you buy a gaming mouse you are a dumb faggot. If you buy any gaming accessories at all you are a dumb faggot.
I fix computer for people, but obviously mostly PC's because people fuck them up more.  I was looking at this guy's mac for him, and when I hit the little green + I expected the window to maximize to the full screen.  It didn't happen.  I was confused, and even tried to drag the window to fill the whole thing up, and it wouldn't even stretch the width of the screen.I dismissed it thinking it was just an old model or outdated OSx version, but today I'm working on a pretty recent Macbook Pro, and I still can't maximize the windows. I knew macs were shitty but I never actually needed to use them. This really was kinda shocking.I also tried to move some stuff to a flashdrive earlier that was working just fine on my windows machine, and it simply would not let me copy anything to this flash drive, but I could move things to another drive that was the exact same size and model. I truly don't understand why.  I couldn't even rename the fucking flash drive or make a new folder on it.Additionally, the trackpad is fucked as hell.  I thought people were in love with the trackpad on the mac, but this particular computer's trackpad is pretty fucking messed up.  It's likely significantly less sensitive in the middle of the pad, so if you drag something across the pad the cursor hardly moves.  I also don't know what the fuck is going on with that.  I tried booting to safe mode and the same thing happened so I don't think it's a software issue.I usually fix PC's, but I'm not nearly as familiar with macs with what to use.  I go into the applications menu and see all the icons, but I can't tell the difference between a system app and some shitty adware that's installed.  Is there something to scan for unwanted programs or general shitty clutter?  Or some antivirus I should install that will take care of this type of shit? Thanks for any help, and I'm sure I'm just missing something about the things I'm complaining about, if anyone has any explanations that'd be great too.
Uninstalling apps is kinda weird too.  Every site I looked at just said to move things to the trash and then empty the trash bin, but then I saw some application that Also removes related files.... So otherwise they just stay there?  Why is this the recommended action to take?
I don't use macs, but these problems are pretty obvious.I still can't maximize the windowsI think there is a maximize button in one of the corners of the window. I don't know what the green plus is supposed to do. This was the first thing that bugged me when I tried using a Mac for the first time.it simply would not let me copy anything to this flash driveMaybe it uses some filesystem that Mac only supports read-only? Maybe there are permission issues?if you drag something across the pad the cursor hardly movesHave you tried dragging faster? In most modern trackpads you'll get more cursor distance from a quick swipe than you do slowly  sliding your finger across. Have you looked at the system trackpad settings?Uninstalling apps is kinda weird tooEach OS X app is essentially consolidated in its own folder. Deleting that folder is like removing a package in Linux; the program may have left behind user settings and maybe some cache and temporary files.
hahah oh wow, how do mac fags not even know what an apparently major ui button does?
I don't use macsHave you tried reading posts before replying?
How do I get to the trackpad settings?  I don't know where to like search for options or programs or anything.
Apple's machines are designed for very simple minded people, who don't want to / can not  question the stupid design choices and blatant fuck ups in their systems, and obviously are also willingly pay for these overpriced design toys.Do you know how Apple "fixes" their customers broken machines? They replace them with new ones. Literally.You can bet that the guy who owns that piece of crap machine of yours would be totally shocked if you'd say that his lil Mac is full of viruses. Or he could just deny all that and call you stupid, 'cos "Macs don't get malware, and never crash!"
idk, but I used to have a Mac.The green + is more of a "fit window to content" button. If you made the window smaller, it will fit it to the correct size. Also, if you make the window bigger than this size, it will make it smaller again.
mac fagsI don't use macsI've only ever used a Mac for like 10 minutes one day. That's not enough to bother figuring out the subtle purpose of a button that has no equivalent in any other major DE I've ever tried.
Each OS X app is essentially consolidated in its own folder. Deleting that folder is like removing a package in Linux; the program may have left behind user settings and maybe some cache and temporary files.Except for those that come with a .pkg installer, in which case your guess is as good as mine when it comes to what was installed and where.How do I get to the trackpad settings? I don't know where to like search for options or programs or anything.AFAIR you can get to system-wide settings app if you click on the apple logo in the top left corner, and then choose something like "System settings" from the menu that shows up. I may be slightly mistaken, as the last OSX version I used was 10.3.9, and that was ages ago I still have the computer - it's a G5 Powermac, but it runs Linux now.
your guess is as good as mine when it comes to what was installed and whereWhat is a BOM?
What is a BOM?Well, a Byte Order Mark is a sequence of values at the beginnig of a UTF-8, UTF-16 or a UTF-32 encoded text file that identifies the file as encoded with said encodings and identifies whether the values are stored as little-endian or big-endian only important when dealing with UTF-16 and UTF-32.Not sure how it's relevant to .pkg packages installing files wherever they please.
He's referring to a Bill Of Materials, which tracks what files from a kg were installed where
maximize windows Okay that one is a bit weird, I'll give you that, but you get used to it. I knew macs were shitty but I never actually needed to use them"I knew a thing that I knew nothing about and had never used was shitty". You obviously know nothing about tech, you're probably some shitty teenager "fixing" PCs for your old family members by installing Avast and Chrome. If not, then you should quit your job because you shouldn't just have prejudice against something you have no clue what it is, fag.it simply would not let me copy anything to this flash drive. I couldn't even rename the fucking flash drive or make a new folder on it.Permissions. Happen on Linux too, you can make it work easily though if you actually know just ANYTHING about IT.Additionally, the trackpad is fucked as hell.Literally most popular and advanced trackpad in the worldIt's likely significantly less sensitive in the middle of the pad, so if you drag something across the pad the cursor hardly moves.Are you so dense you don't realise that this is a hardware fault caused by the retard owner, not the company?but I can't tell the difference between a system app and some shitty adware that's installedThat was never hard to me even when I went from Linux to OSXIs there something to scan for unwanted programs or general shitty clutter?Just uninstall the unwanted clutter.Or some antivirus I should install that will take care of this type of shit? If you install anti virus programmes on any PC, you're not an IT guy. OSX put apps in their own folder, so that means deleting the app deletes the whole app, just not caches and stuff.
"Macs" are personal computers
Or some antivirus I should install that will take care of this type of shit?Installing antivirus on OSXI hope nobody's paying you for your services
Bill Of MaterialsThat's the most contrived acronym I've heard this month.  BOM has a standard meaning  and using it to mean something else is deliberately and maliciously being confusing for the sake of being confusing.
If you install anti virus programmes on any PC, you're not an IT guy.macfags everyone
Did you just fucking call Windows "PC"?
lol I install acrobat reader and charge them $40.
pretending a Mac is not a PCmaking up FUD about Mac OSXhating the trac-oh wait the trackpad actually is shityou're still a shitposter, op
Wikipedia lists it before Byte Order MarkFeel free to point me to the standards body that has reserved the acronym "BOM" to mean "Byte Order Mark" specifically though.hurr durr acronyms are reserved for whatever I'm most familiar with
If you install anti virus programmes on any PC, you're not an IT guy.Our IT department even uses antivirus on the Macs because OCX viruses have gotten prevalent enough to warrant it.If you aren't installing anti-virus, your IT department must be fucked.
Byte Order Mark was invented in 1991 at the very latest.Bill of Materials because "file listing" or "package listing" or "package index" isn't good enough seems to date from 2006.BOM is standardized by the Unicode Consortium, whereas Bill of Materials is standardized by, umm, Apple.Note that Apple is actually a member of the Unicode Consortium, so there really isn't any excuse for them to say "Oh, we didn't realize that BOM was already being used."
We use Common Sense 2015, Premium Edition.Also, I'm not a "macfag". I use a MacBook with Fedora/OSX dualboot for work
Its a "fit content in window" button, some developers decide to ignore the guidelines and cocoa and then we get shit like the mac version of firefox

Alright /g/, college is a no go for me because I'm a legal liability. No, I do not want to get into why, but just know that more than likely, no college will accept me, or at least not for another 5 or so years.ANYWAY, here we go.I'm 19, white, male, heterosexual, cis scum, etc. I figure if I want /g/ to help, may as well tell a little about myself.I'm pretty good at math, and generally everything. I didn't have a hard time in school but I didn't really give a fuck until the last two years when I was in classes that really, really interested me. theory of knowledge, physics, pre calc, etcAnyway, I would say my skills are: computer software knowledgeable in your standard software suites and hardware  I know how to build PCs, install new hardware, and repair them to an extent. I'm charismatic and very socialable. I'm a pretty good looking guy, one that takes care of himself. I'm pretty intelligent, a wide range of knowledge on a lot of things, and I'm able to adapt and utilize new information very easily. I love science physics, astro and philosophy the most out of just about everything, though I love learning as a whole. Superfluous info here, but my hobbies include vidya, anime, cooking, programming eh, just teaching myself python and webpage design at the moment, still REALLY new to it, science experiments, literature, philosophy, politics, economics, mythology, etc.Anyway, what do you think I should do since college is more than likely a no go? What's a good company to get involved in, or hell, maybe even start my own business? Thanks for any help in advance.

My trigger finger is itchy.  Does /g/ have any insight concerning the new AMD dGPU?  Also Mac-Preesh General
Pull the trigger. It is a good laptop.
Does /g/ have any insight concerning the new AMD dGPU?No. AMD GPUs have always been sold on a Mac. Nvidia stuff has had some hiccups few years back.Just fucking go for it! I bought my first 13" MBP 2 months ago and it was the best computing decision I've made in years. It's fucking silent even when I'm compiling long-ass programs and encoding videos.
AMD GPUs have a poor reputation on Apple hardware, which was why people were excited about the switch to Nvidia a few years back. People seemed pretty depressed about the AMD rMBP, but maybe they've gotten their shit together in the meantime.Also the 13" rMBP doesn't offer the AMD GPU, so there's not much insight there about the AMD GPU rMBP any more than any other rMBP from the past year or so.
Most of what I'm reading is the "muh GT 950m," comments.  The Iris iGPU on Wifey's 13 rMBP is pretty solid, so I'm guessing Iris Pro/R9 M300X should be pretty powerful.  The SSD's on that thing are sick.
Bump from 2.5 to 2.8 worth it?
MacBook justice bump!
I have the integrated video 2015 rMBP the amd card version wasn't available for a few days and I needed a replacement pretty abruptly, and it's great. I've never observed any slowdowns or anything.
about on par with a 950m or a 760m. Not sure how they managed that considering it's rebadged cape verde. Probably runs hot and greedy

Since Prezi has come and gone, what's the go-to presentation software if you want something a little more attention-grabbing than Powerpoint?
LibreOffice Impress
Anon please
hipster shit that focuses on stupid fancy effects to distract the audience from a lack of actual meaningful content
\documentclass{beamer}
post actual meaningful contentaudience doesn't pay attention because this is the age we live inYou need both
hey hey I got a fucking crazy idea, what if we fuse LATEX AND POWERPOINT it will be fucking beautiful
bring everyone down to the dumbest kid in the class, no child left behindAmerican education system.
googled it after posting there are already addons or something like that.
Blender
Platex Presentaton
The irony is that you're trying to bring people down to your level, ignoring the ability to enhance the text and your message.It's a presentation, not a research paper.
If your audience doesn't have ADD, they can follow a presentation without stupid effects placed everywhere.
Are you suggesting that everyone should make their presentations boring as fuck and blame the audience for not being interested enough?Why not also talk in monotone and leave the slides blank because if they don't have ADD they'll still care about your content.
You can eat a meal without spice, but why abstain?
Some concepts are better shown with a bit of accompanying effect. Complicated inferences can be shown to be occupying a parrticular level in the structure through the allocation of the current term or topic. First its in the top pile, then the second, then back to the first. Sometimes, the levels are used concurrently and may require a more colorful approach. Sometimes, the amalglamation of the terms could be said to degrade the importance of one term and aid in the emboldening of another. Sometimes students are just so hypnotized or stupid that they need the novel appeal of a new platform to help it all stick. Those people listen to rap music.
What the hell happened to prezi?
Use cute little HTML pages or a cute little javascript applet that cutely animates your cute presentation.
*ahem*is my butt cute?
It's passé
Also is my butt cute?are you hakim?

I scrap slides presentation whenever I can. Voice only.When I make a presentation, I'm going full Steve Jobs and place at most on epicture + one number on each slide, with 10 slides maximum.
underrated post.Blender + Unity app is best for presentations.
it is called beamer.Or do you mean something with distracting animations as well?
Keynote still dumps all over Powerpoint
just so you know, when you give presentations with all these transitions and shit we laugh at you. anyone who actually uses stupid shit like powerpoint effects or bright vivid backgrounds we see as a teenager fresh out of highschool and rightfully so. stop wasting our time with your meaningless shit, and instead of making your presentation so fucking boring, jot down just enough to remember without making it flashy and save us all some time because fucking NOBODY WANTS TO BE THERE
Hey /g/, I think I'm going to switch to Linux from Windows 8.1..My question is, is there a linux distro where I can do the following efficiently:play some steam gameseasily write word documentsuse software like photoshop and after effectsrun autocad relatively fastAnd if so , what's the best distro?
oh and of course HD stream porn efficiently..
basically I just need the best linux distro
Unbuntu is the most supported distro.Unless you become a hardcore gentoolmen, you have no need of any other distro.
graduate high school then come back.
use software like photoshop and after effectsnot gonna happen with linux sorry
Photoshop CS6 works great with WINE apparently. I wouldn't risk it due to cryptolockers, but it's there.
Ubuntu can do all of that except for the Adobe stuff. There are alternatives, but Adobe doesn't give Linux versions.
why does every Linux thread have people shitting it up recommending Ubuntu? it's the literal worst, meme distros aside fedora /gentoo/arch use cinnamon and run Linux mint 17.1wine can handle your retarded cs5/6choose based on what you need your OS to be capable of, not what sperglords tell you
downstream from ubuntu
choose based on what you need your OS to be capable of, not what sperglords tell youubuntu is the le worsty gaiz!don't use doze mememe distros! xDThe irony is almost palpable.
wine can handle your retarded cs5/6
those requirementsI see you're underage but everyone knows Linux only fitsbeing smug on imageboardswatching Animemaking it look cool
play gaymesnopeeasily write word documentsnopeuse software like photoshopnoperun autocadnopeLiterally all of those either suck dicks or require you to use a freetard clone/SWINE them.
what is the best windows distro to use mpd and mpv do some bash scripting use software like evince and eye of gnome run systemd relatively fast
video games are for childrenand nowporn is for teenagersGoddamn /g/ the autism here is unbelievable
SteamOS is based on Debian so your best bet is the -buntu family, Seeing as Debian is one of the most widespread distributions and -buntu is famous for its easiness of use.

I need to move my PC into a new case for my college dorm.It's currently in a full-size HAF 932, and I'm thinking about moving it into a Thermaltake Core X9 pic related. It's bigger than it looks, think your average PC case but twice as wide. I'm thinking that it's weight may make it a good choice in preventing theft, as nobody is going to steal an extremely heavy PC case.
Forgot to add, I can't keep it in the HAF 932 because of flashy red LEDs, and the case is falling apart. It needs a new case anyway.
bump
If your only problem is theft then just buy some good lock for the door and threaten your roommate that you will rape him to death if anything goes missing
Get an old school beige HP case or some shit and fill the bottom of it with lead weights.The few niggers who would steal a computer worth $20 will give up once they try to lift 100lb of slippery metal.
2015dormsReconsider your choices.nigs will steal anything. OP if I were you, I would invest in a lower-spec microatx sized build that you can hide in a drawer. People will think it's a modem.
Don't just rely on it being heavy. Black people are strong.Get some anti-theft cable and tether it to something solid.
You're better off with a crappy looking beige case that looks old and put some pentium III stickers or something on it.
Old thread: Not sure what private trackers are all about?Check out the wiki and update it yourself you want to add more instead of complaining like a fucking child. to get into private trackers and survive: Interview Notes: as a link to find the /ptg/ threadRemember the following:staff read these generals and have posted here before. staff pretend to be normal users asking for invites and when you invite them, they ban you for inviting strangerspeople report emails and other personal info posted here to staff to get you banned.most of the invite offers here are people trolling you with false hopeDon't be a child. Join officially instead of begging. Almost nobody gets invited to trackers via /ptg/. We're mostly about private tracker bros helping each other out with requests, sharing information from other trackers, adding bounty, etc
Bakabt, what.cd, gazelle games, myanonymous.gazelle is probably the worst of them all in my opinion.hardest to seed on and a lot of downtimes.Might as well just go with public trackers at that point.
is seedboxes.cc any good?
So what do you use your seedbox/vps for?
adding to thisrec me a shitbox, at least 1gbps of upload speed, don't care about anything else besides costs.I just care about uploading stuff, 100gb of storage is enough for me, more than that would be a plus and less could be acceptable.
I have a dedi, use it for webserver, fileserver, mailserver, and OVPN as well as hosting a few other minor things. It's well worth the 15$ a month I pay.
cross seed on GGn
hard to seed on a tracker with everything freeleech for hours after upload
webserverNice. I've been thinking about hosting a personal wiki I can use to write stuff down.Basically just install nginx and put the software on top?file serverDo you know if it's possible to set up a "read only" SFTP account? I'd like to give some away to friends.mailserverWhat's that like? This has always been elusive to me. You have your own domain and you send emails as name@domain.com?$15How much storage do you have?
regarding web/file server, see 
if you only use priv trackers, tal0ne is the best.
yeah, it'd be just for private trackers.
For the webserver, I use nginx and have some pages I host, for both personal and work purposes. You should be able to setup sftp to allow anonymous read only access. Mail server isn't terrible to setup, but not exactly easy. I manage three domains and am able to store/send emails from all of themonly one domain needs to be the actual MX server so long as you have SPF records for all of your virtual domains. I get 2 TBs of storage, plenty for my needs.
I get 2 TBs of storage, plenty for my needs.Holy fucking shit What provider is that? I have 1.8 TB for 28 euros a month.
BakabtIt's not really a private tracker mate.
Still a much healthier environment than places like what.cd and gazelle though.There's an actual incentive to seed things even when no one is leeching because you can get bonus points and such.Wish more places did that.
Since it is a dedi, most likely Kimsufi.
KimSufiOVH .I don't completely trust them, but for 15 eurostyped that a bit quickly prev. a month I'm pretty happy with the CPU/RAM/Storage/Connection100/100.
anyone on pedro's here
OVH is one of the biggest hosting providers in the world, they don't give a shit unless they start receiving complaints about you.
just checked tal0ne, RevivalBOX plan seems good because on the unlimited bandwidth, though I wish the amount of users were 5 intead of 10.
I have a 125GB vps that I use to seed what.cd freeleech torrents and sometimes upload new torrents to trackers because my home connection is slow and will never get a single byte of upload after the initial 100% upload.other than that, ssh tunnel, webserver for me and my friendspic related.tfw everything is back to normal
Hey bros. How long did it take you to get your BTN invite after asking the recruiter?
Sad feels. I wanted that 70 GB upload per day. I'd drop a fuckton of it on requests I want to see filled with perfect FLACs.
How much is that per day? Less than 1GB? What's the speed of your box?
1.2 to 1.6 GB per day. 100 Mbit box.
I'd drop a fuckton of it on requests I want to see filled with perfect FLACs.Good. thanks for helping the community grow.Unfortunately I only use my upload to request ebooks. because I don't really like musicI'm sitting on ratio over 30 because ebooks and programs is all I download and they are really small in sizethe average is somewhere around 1GB/day for me100mbit
mfw uploaded 2TB on BTN in 3 days by grabbing everything
all of it?
well i meant everything uploaded since then obviously
Title feat. Artist
How much does the vps cost you?
The funny thing is that it's the opposite in most cases: normal people don't have time for all that invite/interview/ratio/freeleach bullshit because they have social lives and jobs.
Dyslexic?
Autistic?
damn, whats your setup?
Learn to read
me, what do you need to know?
If you have access to private trackers, you have a moral duty to reupload to public trackers.By putting up with byzantine rules and regulations to share content with others, you martyr yourself for the good of mankind.Fight copyright.
Anybody can do that. It's not a big deal.
You're late.
can you ask the staff if they can get back to me about re-enabling my account? I messaged the gmail account on their front page a while ago and they haven't contacted me back yet my email starts with 'em'
Can you join the IRC?irc.xbtmusic.org6667 plain & 6697 SSLto log on our IRC simply set in your client:site Usernamesite PasswordJoin #help
for some reason I can't connect had this issue before too
Do you have an account on any other tracker so we could more securely exchange info?
I'm on Rizon if you don't mind speaking there nick is MH64
Lol what a retard. Can you even read?
DAILY REMINDER THAT ALL REQUESTS FROM PRIVATE TRACKERS ARE BEING POSTED ON:
Where are you hosting this?
how big of a deal is having a seedbox with 100mb of upload vs 1gb of upload?also, I read some of youand in other places use a vps/dedicated server to set up a seedbox, apparently is cheaper? but you need to set up everything by yourself not a big deal, I'm alway willing to learn.now the thing is, every vps/dedicated server I've seen doesn't look better than a seedbox, their upload speed and storage seems inferior. am I missing something?
Whats the best seedbox or dedicated deal for the money? I am looking to build buffer.
Hetzner and OVH have good deals. Hetzner is cheaper but their support is worse.
That's a secret.
But I want one too.
Bakabt is easy enough to freeleech from...just google the anime or thing your looking for and add "bakabt". It basically searches the site in the same way that users can.
What.cd user here, Does anyone want to upload some of their music to google drive?Would be amazing for my ratio and would help other people.
No. Go fuck yourself.
Pretty rad. Wish I had the know-how and time to have done this months ago.
You still here?
tfw gazelle is still down
m8 get real, seeding stuff nobody is going to download will not help your ratio at all. I have more fingers than snatches with a 0 ratio.
greater than 0 ratioUnless you found a way to have a negative upload, I would hope so.
What happened exactly?
Do you want me to break it down for you?
2015not using a hacked shu mod of azureus Google digitsldj vuze, or stay pleb.
Don't know
 That was for you 
GGn is easy to seed on, but I find they have a lack of content.
Wow this is awesome.
PTP, BTN, WCD, AnimeBytes FTW
What software is this?
Can you download Miami Vice?
don't bother m8 the other day i asked the exact same thing and some retard started raging as if i asked for access to his seedbox
muh sikrit kkklub
Cheating on private tracker is dumb. Eventually, you'll get banned for it.The risk far outweighs the good.Get a $5-$10 seedbox, build 1 TB buffer in the first month and ditch that seedbox.Or keep it if you're not a poorfag.
sent ;
build 1 TB buffer in the first monthlol
You can build 1TB buffer in a week you idiot.
what tracker you idiot?
god damn waffles is utterly worthless
he went for waffles instead of what.cdlol what an idiot
We've been over this in previous thread, there is no way for trackers to detect ratio cheating beyond manually looking for obvious cheating such as actively seeding for gain that has no leechers etc.
its not totally worthless, I just use it as a trash tracker to grab mainstream releases as to not tarnish my what ratio :
the community in waffles is top-tierI love the toy drive they have every christmas season.
Best way to farm bonus points on BTN? I have a seedbox.
Grab big season packs with ~3-4 seeders, seed for a year.
Just understand the bonus points formula and work from there. Retard.
tfw BTN, ToTV, HDB, PTP, WCD, AB, GGN mustard race.All I need now is BIB and one other and my collection shall be complete.
Jerking time? No need for HDB really, since some of that stuff leaks to PTP and I don't watch a lot of film/tv anyway.Also, what the fuck happened to STP?
Am I allowed to upload something from AHD to PTP?
the one with the periodicals? no idea. Is it for getting weekly issues of TIME magazine? Don't think I'll bother collecting it.
I don't know. I uploaded a 40 GB remux from PTP to AHD. No one snatched it and a couple of days later I saw there was a second seeder but I got zero upload meaning they just cross seeded it. A week later there was a virtually identical remux of the same movie uploaded and it got 50 snatches. AHD is worthless and shit, especially if you're already in HDB. It's the Waffles of the HD space.
Yes
I'm on ratio watch at what.cd how do I upload bounty shit and how do I make usre I get like 3 GB credit and shit
AHD is worthless and shit, especially if you're already in HDB. It's the Waffles of the HD space.I agree it doesn't help if you are already on HDB, but HDB is wayyyyyyyyyy harder to get into than What so you can't really compare AHD/HDB to Waffles/What. Most people would be fine with AHD and the endless freeleech on AHD internals is certainly useful.
I really hate what CD how the fuck am I supposed to get upload to download I seed forever never reaching anywhere close to 1.0 ratio on torrents I download. I can't upload shit because I'm not in the know to get shit early and all the music I listen to/own is already uploaded
Well I fucked that upI'm not on HDB sadly.Neat
you click on the requests link shit and sort by bounty then you browse a couple of pages and shit until you find some shit you are willing to upload
What are you niggers on?
all the music I listen to/own is already uploadedDo you know this for a fact, or are you assuming because of how much shit WCD already has up?I thought the same until I actually gave my collection a serious look.Turns out I had about 30 different records that weren't on WCD at all, and several more that weren't there in FLAC/100% log FLAC.
all the above except lztrscienceHDcartoonchaosmyspleenbh5
the HDB hype train continues.
I know this for a fact I own 10 CDs and all are uploaded with 100% flacs
You don't sound like you listen to all that much music, so why not just use Waffles, or something?
I listen to tons of music my music folder is about 400gb~ I don't know much about you but I'm only 20 and there is really no reason for me to own the physical disc when I can download it online and most of music supporting has gone through festivals and concerts
friendly reminder that wcd staff are literally hitler
I find it hard to believe that you went through all 400GB of music you have, and couldn't find anything to upload.Is it all Touhou, or something?Anyway, the best way for a non-seedboxer to gain buffer is to upload and fill requests.
Negative and according to a Google search I really don't want to know what tohou is, this collection is years old and every album I have now except maybe 4 or 5 have been listened to at least twiceI did not go through my personal digital collection to try and upload shit because I don't know the sources of most of my old shit and they could be transcoded and it would surprise me if it wasn't already uploaded because I don't really listen to very unpopular musicI literally shouldn't need a seedbox I have gigabit home speeds also filling request for what reason? Nobody ever makes requests for music I'm interested in or curious to listen to.I'd gladly fill a request for an artist or a band I actually listen to but like I said I'm not in the know of getting shit early and everything is on the site within minutes of being released or submitted even earlier
also filling request for what reason?...to gain buffer, as I said.Who cares if you personally like the album?You do it for the 20GB+ bounty that you can then use to DL the shit you want.
That's pretty fucking lame at that point I should just go out and purchase the albums what CD is the only tracker that I have this problem with on ptp I easily get tons of upload and I get points for seeding for an extended period of timeIs waffles better than what CD? Because honestly having to fill random requests just to be able to download something I actually like is ridiculous
I have a dedicated farm and give out free vps on rizon so I can data mine
I know, I know.Giving back is hard.How dare those meanies try to cater to those that actually bring more content in, rather than just move it around?
The more you faggots advertise private trackers on one of the most popular sites on the internet, the more they will be infiltrated and shutdown/incite charges against users. Don't be fucking dumb. 4chan is not the place to talk about true frontiers in technology. 4chan is where plebs come to be plebs and talk about smart phones and dicks. Just look the fucking google captchas.
he mad
I can't bring any fucking content in because everything is uploaded instantly example: I'm still a fairly new what user so when I first joined there was a new album that I liked that came out it was Mr wonderful by action bronson I figure it isn't already on what so I should go purchase it the day it comes out little do I know the 20 minutes I spent out purchasing the album the morning of the release to upload to "give back" the album had already been uploaded hours ago while I was sleeping before the fucking stores even opened upThat's absolute bullshit
Sounds like you need to git gud.
Isn't this sort of the point of a digital release system.
BTW you have to understand how things work in a peer run system. As part of a large group of peers, you can expect that there are numerous people with access to copies of media well before you. Those that work in the industry or just fanboys. You must understand you cannot compete with this niche for popular albums, where you know 10000s of people are going to get a copy. Youre niche lies in providing content that is unique to your position. Think local shows and things like this. Otherwise you just look like a tool thinking you are going to be the guy to upload brand spanking new, and popular albums ahead of your peers.

Have dozens of gigs of music bought on BeatportTonnes of lossless rips of rare dance music tracks that don't exist in a digital format Ripped from Vinyl myselfStill can't get on What.CDFuck this planet.
Are you from a banned country, or something?
It's unfair I don't want to go out and buy something that I will never ever listen to  and I'm being punished because some fucking faggot is faster than me at uploading music? The ratio system is bullshit I just want to share and listen to music I like it's not like I'm refusing to seed  I just get little to no upload and get punished for it by not being able to download more music I like
WAAAH!
I'm being punished because some fucking faggot is faster than me at uploading music
fuck offthe plebs and normies won't be able to get in anyway
listen all i want to do is download music and share music I like, no more and i assumed what cd was the best place for that and it's clearly not
Cry moar.
OUTTA MY FUCKIN WAY I AM ENTITLED TO THIS BOUNTYNo, you're not. Why should they wait for you to upload the album if they can upload it faster?
jesus you seriously thought you can beat the cutthroat market of popular content rushing just because you got up a couple of hours earlier. Are you just mad now that your NEET lifestyle got interrupted and you had to mingle with people who actually have jobs?
You're clearly too stupid to understand how this shit works. Just give up.
I'd invite you just so I'd actually have invitees that actually upload. But its against the rules and I don't know who you are. Besides you could be staff waiting to fuck me over or else be a retard and upload shit thats banned, thinking you can rush to PU or Elite to get into PTP or BTN, and end up getting me and my entire tree banned. If you're from a banned country then move, otherwise fuck off.
even waffles is too good for the likes of youjoin mutracker insteadwcd is wasted on retards like you
they're faster than me, it's unfair!Really?
that's not even the point i could care less about the bounty and more about just getting more of the music i like that i literally can't find anywhere else online for free i'll gladly buy the album i'm fine with that and that looks like what i'm going to have to do if i want to continue to grow my music collection xd too stupid to understand i just want to download music and listen to it and share what i already have/willing to purchaselisten i didn't know how that shit worked so i thought i could help out by purchasing an album and attempting to share italso NEETno i'm a full time college student no what cd is wasted by the faggots who hoard everything and never actually listen to music just hoarding data for muh buffers yes it's unfair i get little to no upload on torrents with a gigabit connection to be able to download more music that i like. i literally just want to download and share music that i like
you have two options here.Either do what these guys are doing  & or just ask staff to disable your account since you seem too retarded to use it
i get little to no upload on torrents with a gigabit connection to be able to download more music that i likeThat's what you're doing wrong. You have to download popular shit from the top 10 if you want upload. If you can't understand basics like that, go back to rutracker.
Or he can stop crying like a bitch thinking that he could compete against people who have been doing this for more than a decade just because he got up an hour earlier.
best trackers for movies & tv ??i'm looking for trackers with great archive & good size encodes  i'm not willing to download 1gb for an episode of sitcom or so on
so i have to hoard music i never listen to for upload? that's absolutely disgusting
hoardDelete it after a week you fucking autist.
Holy shit kill yourself.

Hey, /g/Do any of you use F-Droid to install your apps from? Is F-Droid trustworthy?Is there a better choice out there?
I used it only for adaway, all apps are open source but I doubt every single one of them was audited, even if the code is fine can't exclude the apk might be compromised. There's nothing to install besides adaway from F-Droid anyway.
How is F-Droid any different from the Google Play app store? Are Google Play apps more audited than F-Droid apps?
check which "store" gets more app reviews
I only use fdroid.
topkek no. Hardly anything is audited in the play store. They depend on user submitted abuse-reports mostly. There are adware/malware on the google play store as we speak. Amyway, even users are dumb and will oftentimes write good reviews about malware with only a handful complaining which you won't find anyway. Either install known/trustworthy apps or don't install anything at all from gapps.I use both but only google to keep things up to date. Mostly use f-droid to install external packages. The other guy probably isn't doing much with his root except maybe ricing.
App Store
I used it to install an apk extractor which is pretty neat, call recorder and some other stuff.I found a couple of apps on the play store too but not that many, and I wouldn't have found them had it not been for f-droid. Its not anything essential but it's a good alternative I guess, particularly if you are obsessed with muh freedumbs or some shit

Cisco /b/'sJust passed the CCENT and am now planning to work towards passing the CCNA Security. A few google searches are telling me to complete the generic Routing & Switching CCNA first, but the posters never really give reasons why.Anyone who has gone down this route, can you tell me the reasons why I should take the R&S exam before I start on the Security one? It's not listed as a prereq.
bamp
CCENT is the first half of R&SR&S is really important and other later certs build upon itread this book:
So you're recommending R&S before Security, as well?Well, guess that's it then. R&S it is. Cheers!
What are the good certs to have
more is always betteraside from comptia and cisco you might want mcse, rhel, and some vmware cert don't know what it's called off the top of my headbut honestly they're really all just resume padding
there's no reason to do it FIRST but you should definitely do RS after securityCCENT on a resume looks fucking stupid
Go RS.Normally people get hired or promoted into the security side of the house after they've proved themselves in other areas. Because security encompasses so many fields they're often more concerned with how well of an overview you have of all of the technology and have worked with it than if you've got any security certs. But your mileage may vary.

What is a decent paying tech job where I can sit on my ass all day and not have to interact with many people?
"last resort" tech support on third shift
What skills to you have?
I can defrag a computer
Can you install Adobe Reader?
I think the bare minimum is Google Ultron Knowledge
Sysadmin
was a good thread, godspeed anon
Story of pic?
jp hired maid guy
its a tranny posing for its tinder
If a job is so banal and trivial that you can do it without interacting with anyone, what's stopping someone from writing a bash 1 liner to replace you?
didn't do a daily backup? that's a fucking.no antistatic wrist strap? that's a fucking. every damaged part equals another hour i stretch her ass out. case wiring shit? oh, that's my cock down your throat. better swallow, otherwise that's a fucking.forgot to clean the computer of dust? bend over.i want a submissive sysadmin trap to fuck, i'd get her high as fuck and drunk and then tie her up and fuck her ass balls deep all day. if she does her duties properly she can just slut around on the bed wearing outfits and play games like a dumb bitch.
Contracted software developer?
Nightshift guard.Ask on /x/

Why dont you want to interact with other people?
actually using antistatic wrist strap
God speed Chisame, please come back.
newfag pls go. it's a /g/ regular
You can work at a repair shop. It doesn't pay THAT well, but its easy, almost no human interaction and you can "sit on your ass all day" and fiddle around with electronics.
newfag/b/
That's exactly what I do. Third shift service desk. Hours suck but pay is descent and I never have to talk to anyone. Just work on tickets from dumb VP's.
damage control
I remember when i was a technical writer, i sit all day making an instruction manual on how to operate an equipment, use a software or device. Little interaction except for the usual talking to SME, cascade the manual to people who are gonna use it and some minor reports. Can be boring as fuck if you dont like the subject but can be interesting when you are into it.
traps arent "her"s, you stupid braindead queer.
Pretty sure Chisame is still around, just without a camera and no new clothes.
I know here are a los of traps I'd like to be one of those, but i don't know the story of the OP pic and i read a little out it here and i'm curious about it

tries to bust the claim that linux can not get virusespoints to a virus scanner detecting .exe files and claims the system is infectedArchfag general
Tbh those .exe files caused the program to not launch, which implies malicious behaviour.
I tried to find any blogposts about it and saw a theory on a reddit thread about the antivirus blocking the program from running because of the fact that it detected infected files. Though if that was not the case, why would three loose files when removed change anything. Was the application trying to load them and failing?

Is it normal for a Computer Science degree to have the need to study all these maths?
Yes

Computer Science barely has anything to do with computers.They really should call it Computational Science, or Infomatics.
Oh right, completely forgotten about this
mfw I know all that shit, and I'm not even doing compsci
So does that mean CE have an actual relation with computers since it deals with hardware such as signals & systems, circuit designs, etc etc
What are you studying?
... Mathematics :^
Are you taking a "soft" computer science degree? Probably not, then.But if it's a real Computer Science degree, then yes.
That's more or less the point of compsci, anon.Instead of learning the intricacies of the hardware from top to bottom as in CE, or slave away making websites on one of those "other" degrees, you learn 'higher-order' it's still babby-tier compared to math majors maths that are in use whenever you're dealing with software.
What do yo mean by "soft"?
Basically codemonkey degree
You probably mean something like studying "Software Engineering" or similar."Hard" comp sci is basically applied math
all the fun stuff in CS needs this maths machine learning, graphics, image recognition etc
Basically, yes. Computer science generally treats the computer hardware as a black box that does what they say/program. Electrical/computer engineers worry about the silicon level stuff.
You study math to get a software engineering degree. I think it's mostly those bootcamp courses.
In my first year we went through what happens on a harware level, from transistors through multiplexers to ALUs and memory. Some CS degrees want you to know roughly whats in the black box.
yes of course. if anything just to make sure you are not completely retarded and unmotivated.
For even state schools in the USA, a real program will require a minimum of a 4 on the AP mato exam or a B from another decent school in calc I,  Calc III by the end of sophmore year.Confirm with college websites.
A CE programme in my country are required to take Quantum Physics
Yeah I did that too in my CS degree however it was so vast yet so superficial that it was basically useless
Hi guys Someone would have an idea for how to have a smartphone iPhone recent genre 6, 5, 5c, Galaxy S6, S5 really cheap?
iPhone recent genre 6, 5, 5c, Galaxy S6, S5 really cheap?Look for an opportunity to buy a used device for cheap?You won't have luck in case of apple devices though, they mantain huge resale value.
You could steal one.
yes, they are called chinese phones
Seriously I just want a new and not too expensive smartphone. No flight, no resale or strange bussiness.And if possible, REAL Phones
I just want a new and not too expensive smartphone.No flight, no resale or strange bussiness.REAL PhonesDo you expect someone to post some kind of magical website where you can purchase all kinds of electronic devices for the money they were manufactured?Grow up OP.There's nothing wrong with used devices, as long as youre not an autist anxious of human contact required to buy a used device. I bought a used blackberry q10 for like 120 euro. mint condition because it belonged to a woman. She even threw in some extras. Pretty good deal tbh.
Quick question, is a 550w PSU enough to run two 6950's in crossfire?Looking for a cheap upgrade, can get two 6950's for $100 each used.
why would u even do it, crossfire is shit u can get a 280 for that
280's are $400+ here, 270's are almost $300.
What does /g/ think of this?I can't stand it.
Personally I can't stand it.That is because you have autism.

so as you know /g/, google has already made a statement that they will launch new android alphabetical version for every year. Which mean they will launch different android version ex. 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, etc.Is this a google way to slowly kill custom ROMs?
No
yesyes it is

Anyone here use Modbot for Twitch or know anything about it?Modbot has added support for extensions which is pretty cool. Anyone have any idea if there is a pirated bankheist clone extension for the base Modbot?10 bucks for deepbot is meh if all I want is the bankheist system. There has to be a custom extension or something somewhere.

I think your if condition is the problem. Why is it on ==1 rather than 0?compareToIgnoreCase: a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the specified String is greater than, equal to, or less than this String, ignoring case considerations.
compareToIgnoreCase returns an integer greater than 0 if the string is bigger, not just '1'.You should be using " 0" instead of "== 1".Also your looping logic is inefficient. After every loop, you can guarantee the last element is the biggest one, meaning you don't need to check it again.Soforint x = logicalSize; x  1; x++{    forint y = 0; y  x - 1; y++{Is a lot more efficient.
PS: Use a watch expression / inspect / variable trace in your IDE's debugger together with a breakpoint on the if condition and stepping.You'll see what's going wrong.

You should be using " 0" instead of "== 1".He should be using  0.He wants to do the swap if the artist from song[x+1] from the method argument is smaller than one from song[x], right?
" 0"Oh right, I wasn't thinking too hard about the logic. I just thought that since he used '1' before, it should have been " 0".

why the fuck is the audio level on my computer far lower than on my fucking phone? it's a fucking desktop, am I not supposed to have sacrificed portability for fucking QUALITY? the audio card is probably as big as my phone! holy shit, do the guys who made this computer eat shit for breakfast or something like that? goddammit.how do I enhance the volume on my desktop? are there any apps I can download, or any hacks I can do?
because you're using a different format for your music, or different headphonesor, your sound card on your motherboard could be shit. I'm using an MSI mobo without any issues in my build but remember that HP can't even be fucked to include enough thermal paste in their products so they probably went cheap on the sound card/audio outputAs for "solutions", try using different headphones, update your drivers, use different music formats and see if it changes anything.

I bought a GTX 980 from Best Buy 2 weeks ago. What are the chances that they will let me return it to get a 980Ti? Is there anything I can do?
The ultimate cuck
install gentoo
Come on guys, lets be serious. Can I download more VRAM?
Yes.
replace the inverse reactive current encabulator with a quantum inverse reactive current encabulator and also place a logarithmic cooler on it
so naive thinking that they'd actually have them in stock.
EVGA step up if its an EVGA card.
2 weeksdoesn't Best Buy have a 14 day return policy? if so, just get a straight refundeither that or throw it in the oven for a few hours then RMA it
buying a video card literally weeks away from a new releasethis isnt your average everyday retarded, this is advanced retardationenjoy your $600 life lesson
OP probably just read the tomshardware article on the 980tii wonder what he'll do when the 390x comes out?
short it out while it's running using some bare wire, then pretend it failed and ask for store credit refund
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
What are the chances that they will let me return it to get a 980Ti?We warned you about this. Fuck off.
Hey, at least you're not one of the retards who bought a Titan X.
at least you're not one of the retards who bought a Titan X.What's wrong with the Titan X? It delivers everything in its spec and is the best single-GPU card in the world. I'm still tempted to pay $350 more than the 980 Ti for the Titan X, just so that I can enable Ultra+16xMSAA on 4k.
i chuckledplease don't be real, I'll cry
$350 for a 1fps differenceNever let it be said that Nvidiots aren't retarded.
1fps differenceIt's more than 1 FPS difference at 4K with everything maxed.
Yeah good luck with that 16xMSAA on 4K you fucking retard
The importance of memory bandwidth is reflected in the fact that GTX 980 Ti seems to be even closer to Titan X performance-wise than at 1440p, to the point where occasionally we see the less capable card very slightly outperforming the full GM200 in our tests - margin of error stuff on titles where CPU bottlenecks can cause an issue, and indicative of just how close these two GPUs are in actual real-life conditions.
Buying a titan x for anything other than a workstation is retarded
Guess I'll wait for Pascal's Titan.
Buying a Titan X for a workstation is even MORE retarded.
turbo encabulatorMy ni/g/ga.
implying best buy will check the actual condition of the card if you say it's "broken"there's usually only niggers and other dumb folk working the register. they don't have geek squad run down to test it out.

Can someone gimme a TL;DR version of what happened with the patriot act and freedom act and all that jazz?My understanding of it is that it's the same shit but with a different name. But I could be wrong.
patriot act expired. freedom act new and shiny. same shit minus a few things because of snowden and whatnot.
My understanding of it is that it's the same shit but with a different nameYep
Rand Paul forced the Patriot Act to expire, but the USA Freedom Act only needs 51 votes to clear the Senate on Tuesday.  Our only hope is if the Senate gets cocky and tacks on amendments that the House can't swallow.As far as differences, the main thing is the NSA et al will fetch user data from ISPs instead of collectiong/storing it itself.  Pic related.Not sure if still needs periodic renewal like the Patriot Act, or becomes permanent.
Patriot Act is kill.We Freedom Act now, which is basically a privatized Patriot Act.Thanks Conservatives.
How long do ISPs store data? Will they be required to make their own versions of the Utah Data Center? I can't imagine that ISPs would be very happy about this.
It doesn't matter if they're happy or not. They'll bend over and take it up the ass, like they always do.
Oh, and PRISM is unaffected AFAIK.  Fuck call records, my browsing habits are far more important, yet it gets zero attention in reform proposals.  The cynic in me wonders if they're hoping everyone will just forget about that part.AFAIK there's currently no storage length specified.  I think McConnell wants an amendment to mandate a minimum time, but that's one of the things that might kill the bill if it has to get sent back to the House.
Just go back to sleep it's nothing to worry aboutWelcome to Cosco, I love you
The freedom act changes the date of the patriot act expiration. One of its little things that are not being talked about.
How long do ISPs store data2 years
That's honestly not so bad although not storing data at all would be preferred. I thought the NSA stored data indefinitely. 2 years is a lot better than indefinite storage.

I have a program that's very dependant on random numbers. Not anything cryptographically secure, it just uses a lot of random numbers. Currently, I'm just using the rand%x method in C, but calling a modulo every time seems very very slow. Is there ANY other way that I can generate random numbers in a non-hardware expensive way?
read from /dev/urandom if your program is for Unix.
This is the correct maze, I couldn't post the original one because connection kept timing out on me.
xor-shift is fast and has good randomness.don't use fucking rand%x, it fucks it up, like for example if you have a source of random numbers from 0 through 120, and you want numbers from 0 through 99, then with rand%x number 0 through 20 will be twice as likely as intended
I've found the following three functions to be useful in that regardunsigned int g_seed=0;void randSeedint seed{    if!seed g_seed=timeNULL;    else g_seed=seed;}int randIntint min, int max{    g_seed=214013*g_seed+2531011;    return min+g_seed ^ g_seed15%max-min+1;}float randFloatfloat min, float max{    g_seed=214013*g_seed+2531011;    return min+g_seed16*1.0f/65535.0f*max-min;}When I tested them against GCC rand it was much faster.

all that memory just for a random function? There are plenty much more efficient methods
OH GOD NONOT A WHOLE 16KBSHIT, THIS WILL NEVER RUN ON MY APPLE II NOW
all that memory16KiB.Who gives a fuck?
I am making a program that randomly generates numbers until it generates the number 237,482,348.However, ever 5 random guesses, I interrupt and stop the program. Delete the source and rewrite the source from scratch. I rewrite the identical code every iteration. It doesn't take long, but it's tedious and gruelling work.It has to be done.

Huge C noob.Why doesn't this compile?#include stdio.hint mainvoid{        int a;        printf"Enter in value: ";        scanf"%d", a;        printf"\nYou entered: %d", a;        return 0;}I also don't really understand the scanf and the %. How do you know what % is what? Can you set a % to an int like I did in this programIs that my problem or does that work?.
scanf"%d", a;scanf"%d", &a;
Too much indentation!
you have to put the address &scanf"%d", &a;
Why do you need the &a? I mean, I know that you need the a to set the % to the int but why the &?Sorry, doing it all in nano right now and I cba to space over 4 but I'd rather just tab over.
C only has "pass-by-value" parameters, so to pass a 'variable' to put a value into, you have to pass its address or a pointer to the variable.
understanding c pointers has never been so easy!its a great readpic related
Why am I getting a segmentation error?
you can edit nano to use 4 spaces per tab
this looks like something you'd see in that "bill on capitol hill" cartoon.

Last quarter of undergrad, and I do kind of have a limited amount of time for my presentation, so it would probably be best to not spend a shitload of time going over the details of the protocols for communication between two i2p routers, when more attention could be focused on the tunnel layer and the network database.
C fag needs help with a "login system"#include stdio.hint main {   char username[100];   char password[100];   printf "Enter your username: " ;   scanf"%d", &username;   printf "\nEnter your password: " ;   scanf"%p", &password;   ifusername == "root" && password == "dongs"{     printf"Login successful";  }else{    printf"Try again";}return 0;}So in theoryof what I think should happen; ask for input for username and store into %d, ask for input for password, store into %p. check to see if username is equal to "root" and then check if password is equal to "dongs" and then if they're both equal to the right set value, printf login successful. but if not, try againwhich means even if they get any of it wrong, itll return try again. What happens when I compile this programno errors, it allows me to enter in the username. When I go to enter in the username it automatically prompts me to the else statement.With very little C++ programming knowledge, it could be because the program isn't being stopped inbetween the statements so it continues on until told sothe return 0; statement at the bottom of the program. BUT... it doesn't even allow me to enter in the password. So, in theory; it should allow me to enter in the username and password, return the value of login successful and then carry on the programif this is the case of me not stopping the program to print the else statement message.If this is a simple fix, I am sorry; ignore my autism.
You cannot use == to compare strings in C, because they are considered pointers and the operation is comparing their addresses only, so it is always false. Look up strcmp.
scanf"%d", &username;%d are for reading into ints, not strings. Use %s for that. Same for the %p.username == "root"You can't compare strings like that in C. Use strcmp
you fucking nigger .with strings you dont put the address &and its %s not %d , you aren't working with numbersand also,use strcmp to compare strings!!#include stdio.hint main {   char username[100];   char password[100];   printf "Enter your username: " ;   scanf"%s", username;   printf "\nEnter your password: " ;   scanf"%s", password;    if strcmpusername,"root" == 0 && strcmppassword,"dongs" == 0        printf"Login successful";    else        printf"Try again";    return 0;}
an array's name is a pointer to it's first valueusescanf"%s", username;etc
for starters, you're using "%d", which tells scanf to   look for an integer. Your username is a string, so use "%s" instead. Secondly,  you can't compare strings with the == operator. You need to use strcmpstr1, str2.
%d%pPlease read up need to use []. This is okay if this was a school project of sorts. If this was a real implementation, please do not use scanf. Parse it as a string using fgets and then do whatever with the string. Security issues are caused by shit like this.

I forgot what this does in Java.public class Item {    public static final Item SPECIAL_ITEM = new Item{        public void doSpecialStuff{            // special stuff        }    };}I was trying to use this thinking that it made a method that was exclusively available for the SPECIAL_ITEM object, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Could someone enlighten me or at least tell me what to Google?
I have a git repo setup and am willing to share a simple base for /g/'s projects. I have about 1TB for storage as of now and looking to upgrade. I will not make any attempt to call your code my own and plan to create an agreement system saying and guaranteeing such. This will be of no cost to you. I'm hoping to get a daily/general going for group projects as to clean up the dpt a little. would anyone be interested?There is one caveat. as of right now I don't have a static-ip and need help setting up port forwarding on an old Q100 modem. So this is all for moot if I don't fix that.
Thanks.
C is a very small language, so any experienced programmer willing to put enough effort and time should be able to become proficient in it in 3 months in my opinion this includes creating some medium to large projects using the language, or at least studying some created by experienced C programmers.C++ is a whole different story, though, given its size and complexity of features. I am not that experienced with the language, but I would guess you would need at least one year working with it to say you have a decent grasp of the language, and 3+ years to say you have mastered it.
The 'Stabilis' looks awkward there, the floating sidebar squares look slightly awkward
Pacifc Northwest really breeds the most dangerous types.They should make a programming language that speaks to that mindset. Call it fogslut, or something.
joke's on me
Hmm any suggestion on how to fix them? The Stabilis I could maybe change its location or font. Maybe changing the color would help. The icons I have no idea how to make look better.
HnnnnngI dun it

I'm learning C++How's this?Input base price, inflation rate, and years and then it returns a cost.#include iostreamusing namespace std;int main{    double dCost;    double dInflation_rate;    double dYears;        double dPrice;        char cAnswer;        whiletrue    {        cout  "How much is a batch 200 of pencils?

Trying to learn Haskel.Is there any fucking way to convert a Fractional to a RealFrac? What I'm trying to do, essentially is:divisorsOf :: Int - [Int]divisorsOf x = [y | y - [1,2..ceiling x/2], x `mod` y == 0]So all I want to do is "round x/2 upwards", but I can't fucking figure out how to do it. It seems like a really fucking simple conversion.I bet there's some good reason for it being impossible, but right now I'm just mad.

My school wasn't some fucking public daycare that showed videos and films to students all the damn time
I read that.I have no fucking idea what to do, still. Now, x/2 has a type of Fractional according to GHCI, right? So what I want to fucking do, because there's nothing on that page with a type signature of  Fractional - Integer 
Naive Hungarian typing that is, starting your variable name with a character indicating its type is a real bad choice. Just give your variables good names.Proper Hungarian typing is legitimately useful though, it's for annotating the kind of data where the type system doesn't necessarily have your back. Like if I had strings for directory names, I'd probably make the variables something like dir_porn and dir_hentai, since they'll both be strings but I want it to be descriptive of what these strings represent.
what about this?

If I give you a text-file maze, can you solve and make an image with it?

looks like ramen for dinner, guys...
Depends what you mean by text-file.The answer is probably yes, but it'd be a pain to write *more* parsing code,.
An array of '#' and ' ' characters representing a maze.
Guy learning Haskell again. import Data.ListdivisorsOf :: Integer - [Integer]divisorsOf x = [y | y - [1,2 .. x `div` 2],  x `mod` y == 0]isPrime :: Integer - BoolisPrime x = null [y | y - divisorsOf x, y /= 1]myPrimes :: [Integer]myPrimes = [x | x - [1,2..], isPrime x == True]primeDivisors :: Integer - [Integer]primeDivisors x = intersect divisorsOf x myPrimesprimeDivisors is looping infinitely. I think that's because the intersect function just keeps walking the list forever.Is there a standard intersect function that is optimized for sorted lists? That is, a function with signature of:smartIntersect :: Ord a = [a] - [a] - [a]smartIntersect a b That stops after the member of `a` it's checking for is smaller than a given member of `b`. I'm going to try one myself, but I just wanted to know.
You repeat yourself a lot in the code.You can cut down on repetition by finding common areas to refactor out. As an example:#include iostreamusing namespace std;double user_inputstring query {  char answer;  double result;  whiletrue {    cout  query;    cin  result;    cout  "Cool; "  result  ".\n\n";        cout  "Is this correct? y/n  ";    cin  answer;        ifanswer == 'y' {        cout  "\nIs that so? If that's the case, I shall continue.\n\n";        break;    } else {        cout  "\nI see.\n\n";    }  }  return result;}int main {    double cost = user_input"How much is a batch 200 of pencils?  ";    double inflation_rate = user_input"What is the inflation rate? ex. 5.6 for 5.6%  " / 100.;    double years = user_input"For how many years down the road do you want to predict?  ";    double price = cost + cost - 1 * inflation_rate * years;    cout  "The estimated cost for 200 pencils "  years  " years into the future is $"  price  endl;        return 0;}
Almost certainly. I'd just have to refactor things a bit to get it into the format I want, but I see no problems with this.
I hope you're ready

Specifically, distance / 6000 to make it fit in [0,255]. Was I overzealous?
I tried to make a spiced up version but it didn't do anything interesting.

Perhaps not helpful, but you can just walk around the infinite intersect issue by taking the amount of primes you'll need first.primeDivisors :: Integer - [Integer]primeDivisors x =   let    divs = divisorsOf x    primes = takeWhile = maximum divs myPrimes  in    intersect divs primes
FUCK.abort got called again for some reason, this wasn't a problem with the smaller mazesHere's a much smaller one, about 1/36th of the size and it is generated in 15 seconds.anyone know why this function is causing a call to .abort with very large outputs? friend std::ostream& operatorstd::ostream& os, Maze maze { for size_t i = 0; i  maze.getWidth; ++i { for size_t j = 0; j  maze.getHeight; ++j { if mazei, j == WALL || mazei, j == BOUNDARY os  "#"; else os  " "; } os.flush; os  "\n"; } return os; }

how would one send the argv and argc parameters to lua?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this maze doesn't seem to have any way in...I'm just going to delete the top-left and bottom right and hope for the best.
It should, on the left and right side somewhere. The smaller versions do, at least.
Better! Maybe bold the 'Stabilis' and make the  white as well.

how do i populate a 3x3 grid with x's and o's while alternating the x's and o's? first x picks a random square then o picks a remaining square, etc etc until the grid is full?this it totally mind fucking me :/
Use a binary search tree in C++, std::set and fill it with all possible positions, popping them out of the set as they're selected.
Actually, that solution is really general. For your purposes, just iterate through the fucking grid flipping a boolean.
Thank you for using an anime image.
You know... just about an hour ago, I had a very similar experience. I tried opening  in paint and hitting it with a paint bucket to see how long it would take to fill out the path. It locked up, so I tried sending it taskkill /f, but while the terminal reported that it had sent it the kill signal, the window remained. I did a quick google search, and apparently, Windows cannot kill a hung process. is right. Unix isn't a bitch when it comes to telling processes to shut the fuck up. SIGKILL is really supposed to mean "no, shut the fuck up. I don't want you running any signal handlers, just die right now. You get not one more clock cycle."
Alright, how's this?I moved the buttons up a bit too. The left tray will slide in and outI still can't decide if I should stick with material or switch back to flat like I was doing.

You can test to see if you have a compilation environment installed by copying the following into a file named hello.c:If this doesn't work, you will need to install a compilation environment.

make the top bar go all the way across like in the flat yes
jesus fuck how retarded is thatgcc --version
The problem with that is then I won't be able to make the side bar slide without doing some crazy work arounds with Qt animations.  Otherwise, I'd have the bar constantly sticking out which would look hideous. Also, I need to do something about those buttons. They seem... off
find some other program and emulate ityour design doesn't look standard at all
I suck at log scales
I did a quick google search, and apparently, Windows cannot kill a hung process.Use something like terminate or whatever the fuck it's called. It's got some rather dastardly methods for killing processes on Windows.
your design doesn't look standard at allBlah that's what I was afraid of. I'm not a designer I'm an engineer, they're making me do this because no one else will. I wanted to make something trendy looking so it'd appease our investors and customers though rather than making generic engineer-tier software

Haha, holy shit that looks like a bad maze design. What exactly does the red area represent?Since this was made using Prim's algorithm, it is supposed to be easy to get to the maze's origin and difficult to get to the maze's exit.Try the larger one! 
2/2These mazes seem pretty linear, somehow.The colours are supposed to be red-yellow being distance from the entrance, but the scale is all fucked up and the default is INFINITY
Note to self - Attach picture
Ah, you know what it is? I pick the start and finish to be the first paths hitting either boundary.
You can kill them, but it's more indirect. You sort of have to trick Windows into doing it.
Make an array of the addresses of each grid cellShuffle that arrayThen for each do a standard alternating x and o fill#include stdio.h#include stdlib.h#include time.h#define N 3void grid_printchar grid[N][N] {  for int i = 0; i  N; i++ {    for int j = 0; j  N; j++ {      printf"%c ", grid[i][j];    }    printf"\n";  }}int mainint argc, char *argv[argc] {  srandtimeNULL;  char marks[2] = {'o', 'x'};  char n = sizeofmarks / sizeofmarks[0];  char grid[N][N] = {{' '}}; {    int k = 0;    for int i = 0; i  N; i++ {      for int j = 0; j  N; j++ {        grid[i][j] = marks[k++ % n];      }    }  }  printf"Normal pattern:\n";  grid_printgrid;  printf"\n";  char *addrs[N * N];  for int i = 0; i  N * N; i++ {    addrs[i] = char*grid + i;  }  for int i = N * N - 1; i  0; i-- {    int j = rand % i;    char *tmp = addrs[j];    addrs[j] = addrs[i];    addrs[i] = tmp;  }  for int j = 0, i = 0; i  N * N; i++ {    *addrs[i] = marks[j++ % n];  }  printf"Randomized pattern:\n";  grid_printgrid;  return 0;}

You can still make something look good, just check out some of google's software and make it similar in appearance

Leave.Practice a bunch of basic projects.Then you may return.
You count how many cells you have already filled, divide that by two and substract them to the inverse square rootbecause the array is a square of the array's size.It's always a pleasure to help anons with their programming homeworks.
implying inputting numbers into a 2D array isn't basic
Best book for learning Qt?
Could try changing the next to another nextLine.
*fanfare*
It's basic, but it's beyond putter numbers in a normal array, or using a for loop. He needs to practice *simple* stuff like that.
What? How did I imply that? I asked him to leave until he has a grasp of the basics, which he clearly doesn't.Documentation. Qt isn't a language.
Still looks pretty linear, sadly.
Documentation. Qt isn't a language.I've seen quite a few books for Qt, figured actually reading one would be the better option. I guess I'll look at the docs.
Aw, but it makes sense that it's not going to turn a whole lot. At least it's not as bad as before. Would you say that a linear path makes for an easier maze, though?
For those of you who care, here's the maze-solver code: awayinb4 code is unreadableI was aiming for speed rather than clarity, to be fair.Easier mazeHonestly, I don't have a clue. I just set this baby running and away she goes. It's certainly faster than the first maze with all the wiggling, though. Thanks for giving me a challenge, at least!
Would you say that a linear path makes for an easier maze, though?If the pathfinding is greedy-first it will make for a quicker solve time since it doesn't have to search as far left or right, yes.
How fucking long did it take all of you to learn all of this? How much studying?
I've been self-teaching for 6 months total not consecutive, 2 of the months were last year, nearly all of my free time is spent studying or working on projects
Not long, it really feels like I wasted a lot of time in high school when coding is so easy to learn.
Do you have any uni education? What are you using to teach yourself?I was considering codeacademy.
I don't know what to do.  I've been working on A* but it's kinda a natural stopping point and I want something new.
Codeacademy is shit but I guess it's something to start with. Get a textbook and do every project in it.
Oh, and if I'm going to be using codeacademy, where should I start? With java or something? And should I be using a notebook to take notes and shit?
I start college this fall don't worry, not underage b&, just young.I recommend to avoid websites at all costs. Textbooks are the best way to do it, just read it straight through and do all of the exercises, and some projects along the way. My first book was pic related.
How come websites aren't recommended?
Eh, I wouldn't say to avoid websites at all costs. Some opencourseware is pretty good. Codeacademy I agree isn't that great. They never really 'take your training wheels off' so to speak.
They teach the bare minimum. You get no deep understanding, it's difficult to actually come up with a project on your own and write thousands of lines all on your own, because the entire thing holds your hand. It'll have things like "Type this -- it does this! Moving on..."What you really need is understanding: why does this do that? How? How can something else do that, or how can I do it differently? Stuff like that. You have to know how to program, not remember a certain string of words that worked before.When I first started learning, I used and I retained nothing. It was teaching what are actually complex topics very quickly and not explaining them.This anon brings up a good point, when I said avoiding websites, I meant specifically ones that are like 'tutorials' moreso than classes. Watching actual video lectures with serious a syllabus is good, too. You'll probably want the accompanying textbook, though.

 All communication goes through email, just like the Linux kernel is developed.
In the console, or graphically?
needing a guru for thisHey, you. Yes, you here:.This guy is an example of why you need to avoid shitty online websites and just do all of the projects in a textbook: so you don't post questions asking about stupid, simple stuff that isn't even specific to the language.
it's a windows form application, so graphically.
Add a FlowLayoutPanel to your form, and then do something likeforeachlabel l in labelCollection{    flowPanel.addl;}etc.The panel will automatically deal with positioning.

Ok, so, after trying to get through some tutorials, I have concluded that typing a code and then figuring out why this accesses that and commenting my copy-typed code with questions and notes is far better.Now I have two questions:How do I use github as a retard linux user?If I post my github, do I get feedback and some answers even if I code in Java?
uses codecademy anywaywhy
No?I have found some sites with source code in Java, downloaded them, imported them into the IDE and investigate the relation and concept of why  like this and why not like that.It uses the Model View Controller Concept, and I want to get into it, because it seems to be very useful and I learn an OOP language.I think you might have either misread something, or have responded to the wrong person.
Maybe if I throw enough buzzwords out there they'll think I know what I'm talking about

I am doing a CS assignment, C++ network sockets.Does anybody have some like mnemonics or shit for remembering the fucking sprawl of structs, macros and functions for this?it's taken me days to slowly understand as much as I have but I'm constantly CONSTANTLY referring back to the man pages for absolutely every step.
If you don't get tips on mnemonics, it might help to print your own help docs structured as you like that you can refer to. Would be worth it imo
Either that or someone really uneducated with this stuff, and I mean less than people that watch crime shows. Use of the word "code" is only okay if the only replacement is "source "codingdo you code?jesus fuck I hate that so muchI can't help you but that's interesting anon, I'm just now starting to learn about sockets in C as per Don't really have a good resource yet though, just reading good ol' Wikipedia. I should really get back to C++, but C is so comfy.
Wow. Was supposed to be "source \[code\]", like 'code' is optional. Damn it."Source" is a little annoying too. Maybe I'm autistic.
I should mention that I've been using this more than the man pages, resource, but the information just doesn't seem to stick in my mindThat's a good idea, might do that
You are. Code is shorter than program or develop and simply bounces of the tongue easier.
Those traits of the word really don't contribute to it's acceptance in the slightestCompare "nignog" and "President", then see what the US congress says more often, and why."Code" just makes you sound uneducated.
I'm working on a lua file that currently just outputs text to the terminal and gets user input and prints more etc. etc. But I was wondering if there was any way I could get it all to print to a window and accept user input from said window. I mean I know I could use a framework but can I do this without one.
nice aliasing, faggot.
If gcc isn't setup then probably a lot is messes up I guess is what he means, or he's an idiot because you can just do "install gcc", etc. with your package manager

This website triggers my autism so bad that it hurts
You are autistic.  Non-native English speakers learn differently and you can understand what their native language is from their grammar constructs."Do you code?" is a perfectly valid question.  Get off your sperg steed.
Grammatical correctness isn't my concern, friend. If the guy's foreign then it's understandable, obviously.

I know this question has probably been asked here before, but I figured I would post it in one of these threads instead of making a whole 'nother thread for it.I recently finished up a programming class in Java this past semester, and figured out I love programming. I unfortunately started off with Java and want to know if I should back track, or what language would be the next best for me to learn during my time off from school over the summer. Sources/Websites that would help would also be greatly appreciated if there are any!

Making a silly platformer in Canvas. Its alright, even though I am sure I will never be able to code a game that sells more than 2 copies.
using javascript?
Yeah. I'll look into node.js for the server as well, right now I hosted it on XAMPP.
favourite programming paradigm /dpt/?
Object oriented programming, even though in practice I an often forced to go for functions in order to get things done in a small time frame.
i tried nodejs once and was confused as fuarknot for beginners definitely
i just need to do some X before i start codingill just set this up before i do Xone hour later
a mix of opp and procedural. as in, I use objects for storing data and entities and doing simple operations on them, but the program flow is mostly procedural, without some FuckingManagers or GameControllers or other shit.
i tried nodejs once and was confused as fuarkwell thats because you have suffer from severe autistical autismoness spergy spergistal disorder
OOP for stateful operations and functional for everything else.
Are you trying to tell him he is autistic or that he has to be autistic to use nodejs?I cant tell, because your post is too autistically written.
muh autistical like intentionsmuh aspergistical fantasiesmuh autismo social skillsmuh spergy McSperg programming skills
How? If you know Javascript, then you should be already familiar with the language specifics. There is not much node.js brings apart from a module loader and some extra functions.

Holy fuck can someone help me with 3d Sphere collisions it just doesn't seem to fucking work no matter what.Here's the formula I'm using, my code looks exactly like that too ffs. you know anything about collision can you help?
learn2calculus/physics
class="quote"Unstable: remaining functions have not been scrutinized enough to be stabilizedRemind me again why Rust is at 1.0?
First of all, I can't access that site without a login.Second of all, collision detection between two spheres is extremely simple. Calculate the distance between the centers of both spheres. Then add the lengths of the radii of both spheres together. If the sum of the lengths is greater than or equal to the distance, you have a collision.Really, it's the same as with 2 dimensions.

why does your chat app look like google?
I think what does it is the blue I use. But nothing wrong with Googles design language imo.
So I'm reading an anime on bota.to and I had a thought, how hard would it be to make a bookmark that remembers it's history.  So if I book park on page 15, then open the bookmark, read up to page 24, and close the tab, the next time I opened it it would go to page 24?
Total js noob hereThere are on_close and on_load_complete callbacks and html5 added local storage. Combine those and you have basic sessions.
parameter a to scanf needs to be a pointer.scanf"%d",&a;Have you done pointers yet?
that feeling when sample code you want to reference has been taken downAnd it is all Google's fault.
Understanding C pointers where never hard.
Nice buffer overflow.
strcmpNot strncmpIt's like you guys enjoy your buffer overflows.
0.
Not being able to guarantee a null terminator being presentEnjoy wasting your time calculation the strings length when you don't need it.

/g/ im having serious trouble with my c# assignment. I need to make a tic tac toe simulator using a 2d array of ints. I have no problem populating the 2d array of 1's and 0's which represent X and O, but sometimes I'll get too many X's or O's which makes the simulator unrealistic, and im also confused on how to transfer that data to show as an X or O in the labelsthe form looks likelabel1 label2 label3label4 label5 label6label7 label8 label9What would be the easiest route to accomplish this?
and then your null terminator exceeds your buffers length.
I C what you did here
The garbage collector will be coming for you soon, my friend.
He can't even handle his inputs and null terminators properlyWe aren't all retarded like you, you know.
var you: ^coolguy;
He can't even handle his inputs and null terminators properlyI can, it's called using safe functions like strncmp and fgets.
Right, fgets and string literals are guaranteed to have a null terminator at the end of the buffer. Why the fuck would I waste time calculating the string's length when I can just strcmp?
NEW THREAD AT NEW THREAD AT 
What would be the easiest route to accomplish this?Pay attention in class
Your probably right, i seem to be confusing strncmp with strncpy.My mistake.
Did conway's game of life in F#, I feel there are far better ways to do this.

That makes an excelent texture, reminds me of diffusion limited aggregation
what happened if you make one linked list equal to another linked list just by list_a = list_b?
Depends on how your lists are set up, but if list_a and list_b are pointers to the first node in the list then list_a becomes the same as list_b.
what's the laziest way of making a databse program with XML support in C?With fancy windows of courseIt has been ages I wanted to do it for a game I'm playing and google docs keeps fucking up my XML queries
XML2015XML still has its uses for structured documents, but use something better if you're going to make some sort of database with it.
Which ML is better?OcamlAliceF#XML
I explained it wrong: I need to handle numbers from the internet in Xquery, I've no other way.Google keeps fucking over my calls so I cnt just use google docs. And a full blown program would end up with better eyecandy than a grid of cells.Database features may end up there, but ofc I'd handle them someway else

So since uTorrent is an ad-riddled government honeypot, and qBT just plain doesnt work pic related, is there a client out there that just works at letting me download torrents?
qBittorrent, if you have a working brain
Works on my machine :^
qBT just doesn't work I've been using it for years on GNU/Linux with no problems whatsoever.
Etherkill nice meme
Deluge you fucking newfag
qBittorrent doesn't workIt's not our fault you're literally retarded.DelugeDisgusting.
Jesus Christ who needs to download that much shit at once?  Please revaluate your life, autist.
150GB of downloadswtf are you downloading anon????GNU/Linuxgo to bed RMS!
CheckingQueuednot woking.It's official: OP is a retard.
Am I being rused?  You can't be serious.
probably doesn't even have a enough space on his HDD to download all that shit so it stallsblames it on the client
qBittorrent works fine. Change your queue settings you fucking moron.
Enable more than one download a time retard. It's probably better that you stick with utorrent though, it seems using anything else is beyond you.
deluge

Tixati.
setting it to only download one thing at a timewhy isn't it working?
No trolling outside /b/.
tixati
Transmission or rTorrent if you're on Linux or OSX.Apparently none if you are on Windows.
setting it to only download one thing at a timewhy isn't it working?Looks to me like it crashed and is checking EVERY SINGLE TORRENT for its progress vanilla BitTorrent also did that, before fast resume became a thing. But of course, because file hashing is I/O intensive, it's doing it one a time. Have fun waiting if you have a large queue.
Transmission Transmission-QT on windoze
i am too retarded to tweak settingswhy is it not working?
Check your trackers. Do they all say "not working"?Yeah. It's not qbt
There is literally nothing wrong with utorrent. It does what it's supposed to pretty well.
DelugeDisgustingCare to explain?
Well. Apart from the developers having no regards for the users.I just don't get why people are so adamant to keep using a damn torrenting client.If there was any sign the one I was used was doing shady shit I would switch in a heartbeat to one of the many alternatives because it's just a fucking torrenting client.
transmission u faglord
Didn't the latest update pack a bitcoin miner?
uTorrent 1.8.5updating is largely a sham
has problems with qbittorrenthas no problems with delugeboth use libtorrent-rasterbarThe placebo is strong with you.
Can you start a blog about being a general idiot? I'd like to read it sometimes to see how idiots think.class="quote"old, unupdated, networking software
the joy i get from using the right client is greater than the tiny decrease in security.i could use your same argument to say only an idiot uses a credit card on a computer.
only an idiot uses a credit card on a computer.I don't see how that's a valid analogy.Either way, you shouldn't spread stupid information like "updating is a sham".
You can use Deluge on Windows and Linux and it's open source.
none of them is using the almighty µTorrent 2.2.1
it is, though.  it's a hassle and in some cases a huge cost, at a phantasmal gain.is there any evidence that says people who update get data stolen less often?  what benefit have you gotten by updating your software in the past year?i'm not saying never update.  just keep it a conscious decision.
Deluge is clean, ad-free and fast. Just use it.
Hey /g/,I'm looking for some good web/email hosting / VPS services, preferably those with freedom respecting policies. I understand that it is probably virtually impossible for a provider to offer everything and the kitchen sink when it comes to libre/Gnu/RMS/what-have-you, but at the very least I'd be more comfortable going with say a company that donates money to the EFF and spoke out against things such as SOPA than I would be signing up with say GoDaddy or BlueHost.This would be strictly for personal use so I don't need anything enterprise-grade, and I'd pay any amount for a service oriented as outlined above with good customer service so money isn't an issue. Any good recommendations?
bump
no takers?
I just buy dirt cheap NAT servers for like 3 USD a year and I never use them. I could host something for you guys, but I don't know what.
gotta be more specific dude, what the fuck are you going to use it for?I just use digitalocean for like 99% of my stuff, I use dreamhost for my clients so I don't have to fuck with all their shit though.
who from?
I'm looking for email hosting, git hosting, syncthing/seafile hosting, and possibly web hosting. Whether or not a single service can encapsulate all of that doesn't matter to me, just looking for a provider to get my feet wet with.
so cheap you don't get a dedicated IP and they're all really low end. Be careful with this.
you cool with setting up and backing all of these up yourself?
I worked at Bluehost. They liked to say they were a 100% free and open source company, for examole Open stack, KVM, Centos, but on the inside we had a lot of proprietary shit, like supervisors with company leased mac books, and google apps for our emailing system. Our CMS for internal use only wasnt open, even to us employees. Only devs got to see it. That being said, I dont know if any company can be truly 100% opem.
Cool as a cucumber
I don't see why not, are you suggesting I roll my own server?Thanks for the link, holy hell are some of those packages cheap.
That's unfortunate. I used you guys for web hosting a few years ago and getting set up / maintenance via the cpanel was all a breeze even the price was fairly competitive, but as I mentioned I'm trying to move away from companies that deploy tactics like as you explained. Surely no company can be truly 100% open, I'm just looking for companies that are at least interested in being so and exhibit that in one form or another.
Anyone have experience with any of the providers listed here? Wiki page hasn't been updated in almost a year.
there is a difference between the customer's system and their own internal systems
just fucking use linode you autist
I've considered them but 1. they're based in the US which somewhat defeats the purpose of me wanting to roll my own email and 2. to my knowledge they do not accept bitcoin. Excuse me while I strap on my tin foil hat but both I believe are concerns when seeking a more freedom-respecting service, be it the fault of the service itself or where they choose to set up camp.
Any other suggestions?
arvixe? i dont fucking know man just google it. just know you get what you pay for. linode, digitalocean, rackspace and AWS have all been kickass for me but i'm not trying to hide my weird ass fetish porn on it like you are. fucking sicko.
Why do you need to use bitcoin?You know they have your IP every time you communicate with them to receive email right?You know they have to, or you can't get your email, right?Or are you planning to use tor compromised or another vpn/proxy just another link in the chain to access it?
NAT = Network Address TranslationAlmost all servers are set up behind NAT. It has nothing to do with your personal privacy how someone else routes their traffic.
Gandi is awesome I use them too.linodeif you don't mind being owned by NSA, linode is also an option.

is the ipod touch 4th gen good for emulating retro games
It's not bad, and while I still think android's a joke....it does edge iOS on emulation.Get any android phone with a decent enough dual core processor and 1GB of RAM and you'll literally have no problem emulating any retro title.You can still emulate just fine just about anything besides n64 or NDS on a weaker phone.
What retro games are you trying to play anon
touchscreenemulationAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAFUCK NO.Fuck your shitphones and fuck this huge step backwards in technology. Time to let this garbage die.
This Moga Controller is $12.49 on Amazon.  I have it, and it works just fine for emulation.
ipodemulateno
yes get an adapter that hooks your ipod/iPad to a television  jailbreak and pair Wii remote  use actual hardware controllers plugged into Wii remote adaptersI use my iPad 2 as a retro console emulator all the time
I had it, it worked. Too bad a 40cm fall killed it, fucking glass edges
The iPod Touch 4 isn't a smartphone, you butthurt literal retard. It's not surprising that a butthurt literal retard like you has never heard of gamepads.

have 16:10 screenopen videoblack bars everywherehow can people tolerate this? no wonder apple went 16:9 on their iPhones
It's one on top and one on the bottom. Since I use MATE with two panels, it doesn't really bother me. You could learn to live with it too.
he fell for the 16:10 meme
it makes everything more cinematic
how can people tolerate this?By not being completely autistic? Next you will be complaining about bezels.
ur mum seems more cinematic when I put a box on me 'ead while she is sucking me dick mate
watching vids full screen while on a pcwhy?
Bezels are annoying. Especially if they're significantly off-center like some Thinkpads.
16:10 is not for videos. It is a computer display format. If you wanted to watch movies, get a television.
at least bezels are completely black and don't have some shit light glow like IPS panels
16:10 is shitOnly counter culture 2obscure4u douche bags use it.
have 16:10 screenwatch 16:9 contentWHY ISNT IT FILLING THE WHOLE SCREEN WTF?!why did you buy a 16:10 screen for watching 16:9 content if it bothers you this much and why were you not well aware of this prior to buying it?
holy fuck larkin lovethanks now I need to wank
Your fault for buying a shitty monitor. You could also drop the brightness a bit to compensate this.
16:10Why isn't it 8:5?
Black bars were annoying like a hojillion years ago when broadcast television switched from 480p to wide screen, but a computer monitor is not a television.
In a 16:9 screen the image would still be the same size. The bars come from you having more screen estate than the video can use.
16:10 is for work you autist
Because normals wouldn't understand the comparison to 16:9
17.7:10 has more horizontal pixels than 16:10, therefore it is better suited for productivity AND media consumption. 16:10 plebs are retarded.
yet i bet you're one of those idiots that sayhurr he has a TV
post link to vid plz
17.7
17.7:10Isn't that just 16:9?
still watching movies in 16:9 and not 21:9 master race
sAUCE PLEASE
/v/figuratively kill yourself
16:10Isn't that just 8:5?
get a load of this tard
It's closer to 4:2.5
Well fuck you both
two panelssounds an awful lot like two clock
One tells the time and launches applications, the other switches windows and workspaces. Feels good man.
You are autistic as fuck you know that?
it's pretty convenient if you want more information at once
have 16:9 screen figuratively speakingwatch movieblack bars everywherehow do people tolerate that?Less vertical bars watching 4:3 shit on 16:10, too.
Just crop the sides.  They know people have 16:10 screens so it's rare for important information to be included in that area.  Especially if all you're doing is watching big boob porn.
Use vlcWhen video is playing, press C on keyboard until aspect ratio is full screen
watching 16:9 media and not 2.35:1 mediaYou don't know the true meaning of letterboxing.
sauce.
thislarkin love obviously
Someday someone is going to invent miniature theater curtains that attach to TVs and monitors and make a fortune from people who care about this.
So, how do you feel whenever you watch a video that's 2.35:1?That's most blu-ray videos.
How can I sms track a phone withought touching the target?
You can start by uploading a huge black image to /g/.
