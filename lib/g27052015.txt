Summer edition.Old thread:What are you working on, /g/?
Rewriting the Winter Kernel in December.
SURE IS DECEMBER IN HERE
I wish the OOP of other languages was like Go's OOP.Type forwarding, no inheritance and implicit interfaces are such a damn sweet way to do OOP.
How do I learn C++? What would be the point in learning C++? What can I do with C++?
Thanks for not using an anime picture

Backend servers, desktop applications, video games, anything.
What's type forwarding?>no inheritanceLOL! because less languages features is a good thing : DDD.inheritance is grossly overused and misused, but it's still useful in the right situations.
How much logic do you think someone writing the most fucking basic thing you can involving inheritance would have in their classes?Yes, BugAbstract and MammalAbstract would probably both extend an AnimalAbstract if they were actually real classes in a real world setting used for a real project. In an hypothetical example to educate someone about why sometimes interfaces and abstract classes might seem frivolous (and be unneeded) that would probably be retarded.

>Type forwarding is inheritance done right.No, i mean, what is it? Like, gimme an example. "inheritence done right" is too vague to be useful.>Sometimes less language features are better, for the sake of simplicityTrue, but inheritence is more than useful enough to deserve a place in a langugae. Unless this type forwarding thing basically does the same thing. PHP, Perl and C++ aren;t shitty because they are complex. Well, they are partly.. but mostly because they are horribly designed. All the language features are pilled into each language in a thoughtless way that makes real code difficult to read.

what does this even mean?
Previous thread.
>Yeah, I don't think optional support is something I want to try and support. It'll just add a bunch of bloat. Because Swift isn't a dynamic language, you'd have to do a bunch of type checking.Please, anon. You iOS devs are so masochistic. Apple gives you a language with a tolerable type system and you just say lolbloat.
I have been informed that my features are going to break in about 5-6 months with the creation of a new system for moderation. Depending on whether or not I have time to fix all of this crap, this may very well be someone else's problem when that time comes!
I don't even remember what that was in reference to. Was that optionals inside of collections?iirc it was because once you have an optional inside a collection, it loses the bridge to Objective-C. Which would have caused some problems. But I think I might revisit optionals.
>What can I do with C++?a lot of things>What should I do with C++?not much reallypick something sane if you're starting out, for your own good. probably java or python
This is pretty cool, hope it turns out
// importing Foundation bridges numerous Swift types to Objective-C typesimport Foundation[AnyObject]() is AnyObject // true because of a bridge to NSArray[AnyObject?]() is AnyObject // false because of optionals[AnyObject?]() is [AnyObject?] // true
how advanced is dynamic programming? cs 101?
Compile them both and investigate the resulting ASM.
So I have an object Item, and an object order inheriting from it. I want the order object to have a constructor, that takes an string as an argument, from which it parses the parameters for initializing. The item object already has such a constructor, but obviously only for parameters of the item object.How do I design the constructor for order to initialize the inherited parameters from the parsed string? C++.
So I'm rewriting an old C project that was a mini library in C++ to learn by usage, and I'm wondering if structural etiquette of C++ differs:Do I have a class definition in the .hpp file, and the member function definitions in the corresponding .cpp?
>dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems.seems like a buzzword name for an obvious concept
It is, some tutorial somewhere one time was trying to tell me that iterating over an array was dynamic programming.

Typically thats how you do it unless the classes or functions are templated, then everything needs to be in the header file.Im writing a radial menu in  C++ for use in a game engine. Fair bit of trig involved.
Congratulations, you have a strong opinion based one some shitty blogpost that was incorrect.
It wasn't a blog post, it was a pretty popular programming challenges site.
nth for APL.
reading k&r right now (in the structs chapter)is that book any good?
If it's just a radial menu in the centre of the screen, you shouldn't need any trig for that.If it's floating in 3-d space or something fancy like that, then perhaps you do.
Is this still the case if enclosing everything in a namespace? Do I have another 'namespace myns {' in the .cpp files?
Can't speak for that book, but K.H. King's Modern C book is pretty good to follow up K&R
I haven't read either but I can guarantee you reading an outdated book on a timeless language is not a good idea, unless you plan on traveling back in time to program. Did you know 'int main() {' is a bad practice?
There's a little bit of polar to cartesian conversion in setting up each menu button's text box, as it has to match the slice in the circle menu.
Does anyone know some good programming challenge sites? Project Euler was nice, but googling for them just yields "I want more Project Euler but with less math"Fucking normies, I want more math!
Did you finish Project Euler?
Yes. Namespaces are your friend. Use them. Use them a lot. And  using namespace mycn  works inside functions, so you don't need to declare it in global scope if you don't need to.
get "understanding and using C pointers" it's much betterIs your web framework of your choice total shit? see https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks
No, not even close, I just finished the problems that were relevant to my fields of interest. Quite a lot of the later problems are more about optimization rather than pure mathematics. That is, a number problems tend to be contrived in such a way that they'll be extremely slow to compute rather than be mathematically complex.
Thank you for your kind help anon, just wasn't sure if I could write for a namespace in multiple places.C++ is so awesome.
I've worked with it a lot lately both in and out of classes. Still my favorite language.
Ah I see, I only did the first several a while ago. Hope you find your math problems, anon
>a pretty popular programming challenges siteyou overestimate the importance of whatever site it was
C hasn't shown it's age to me so far.Like you said, it's timelessEverything compiles perfectly from the book with no warnings from gcc.I also write my functions as suchint main(){}Why is the example you've shown bad practice?Is it just a preference thing?
At least Wikipedia is "good enough" in the meantime. Thanks anyway.
Alright I can't seem to make it work, how do I use the constructor of the child class to initialize protected parameters of the parent class? It gives me an access violation right now.
int main() in C is a function that takes an unspecified number of arguments. Most people expect a function that takes no arguments, which is actually int main(void)
Don't believe the hype that newline before bracket matters. Either way works, it's just a formatting issue that people bicker over. Focus on things that matter, like structs with or without typedefs.
The empty parameter list for main is bad practice, not the style of where you put the brackets.Rosalind.info
And why can't I use get functions from the base class? I hate inheritance.
so I'm basically quoting stack overflow here but if you have a two classes like so, class Parent {public: Parent(); void doParentThing();}class Child : public Parent {public: Child();void doChildThing();}The following implementation of the child constructor & child function is valid.Child::Child() : Parent() {//do something here.}void Child::doChildThing(){ //do something child specific, then call parentParent::doParentThing();}
Hey /g/, are you badass enough to put all your code in one file?http://www.asd.gr/~navis/part_start_lines.cppIt contributed to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQngoCBvq3Q
Ok that actually makes sense, now how do I initialize parameters like I need to? Using the default constructor for the parent class doesn't work.
or it was Lifeforce. But I don't remember Lifeforce having fish in it.
You mean in the parent?Child::Child(): Parent(params){}
so the colon shorthand is bascially how you can initialize member variables or call parent classes without needing to put them in the body of the function. Infact it's the best practice to initalize parent classes with this form. For something like you'd describe it'd be as simple asParent::Parent(string s) : mSomeString(s){}...Child::Child() : Parent("someStringParameter") {}
I need to modify the parameters, can I do that in the child constructor like that, and they will be used after being modified for initialization?LikeChild::Child(string line): Parent(int number){line_number = parseLine(line);number = line_number;}Something like that.
I'm not at a IDE so I can't confirm this to be accurate but you might be able to do it like this... Child::Child(string line){ int number = parseLine(line); Parent::Parent(number);}
I would have a string like "8    10,000    173.78 ISK    Gaha IV - Moon 5 - Republic Security Services Assembly Plant    86d 13h 12m 55s"Some parts of it are for the parent parameters, some for the child parameters, and it depends on whether I initialize the parent directly, or the child, what parts of the stirng I need and for what.Tried that, linker error.
K&R is oudated. You should read C Programming: A Modern Approach>Everything compiles perfectly from the book with no warnings from gcc.Unless you have gcc >= 5, the default standard it compiles with is ANSI / C89 (technically it's gnu89). By the way, always add -Wall
Until you use the visual studio compiler.
What was the correct version again?I keep typedefing my structs normally, only hiding pointers is a no-go.
>always add -Wall-Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic is a pretty good setup, methinks.-Werror is a bit overkill, sometimes.
typedef struct {int foo,} bar;
>ISKWhatcha makin' Capsuleer? You might want to revisit your design if you can and maybe set it up so you can set the parameter after the parent class is constructed?
he said he's using gccalso -gfor stuff other people will have to deal with,    -std=c99for personal stuff    -std=gnu11 -D_GNU_SOURCE
>for stuff other people will have to deal with, -std=c99Why no -std=c11?
A market bot, it's just too easy to automate, probably even easier than a reasonable mining bot.I would probably rather scrap the whole inheritance thing and do it the copy paste way, are you sure there is no other way? I don't need nor want the parameters to change after initialization at all.
Maybe, it depends.
why are you not learning from the best tech university in the world right now?http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/
I like that answer.
If you just follow the principle of not changing it after it's set, it's not like you're releasing it as a library for other programmers to use.
I'm working on qtbindings with ruby so far so good but is there some graphical explanations to how hboxes and vboxes work?
some embedded platforms may not have c11, or coworkers maybe be running on old ubuntu versions
So something I've taken for granted, but don't really understand: why do you preincrement iterators in a for loop in C++? ex: for(it_type it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it)
I wasn't be sarcastic. It's a good answer. Short, sweet, and to the point.
But surely there must be a better alternative?
It doesn't matter, both will do the same, you also acn just:for(const auto &element: v) {/// do something with item}
So if you're parsing out the ISK cost, I'd just make the child constructor accept an integer too, and just pass it to the Parent. When you construct the child, call it like: Child* c = new Child(parseLine(line)); 
Last time I checked it did matter performance wise. Postincrementing actually makes a copy of the object.
Because postincrement has to make an extra copy, to return the "original", non-incremented iterator.  Preincrementing does not need to make the extra copy.
I'm still working on the beer simulator. I've not started coding it yet because I think I need to do more research into the core user experience by drinking more beer.
>Last time I checked it did matter performance wise.What sort of performance effect are we talking about here?
I will just post the relevant code, that's probably the easiest way to solve this.Item::Item(std::string entry){    std::string* split_entry;    splitString(entry, &split_entry, '\t');    this->name = *split_entry;    split_entry[1].erase(std::remove(split_entry[1].begin(), split_entry[1].end(), ','), split_entry[1].end());    this->quantity = std::stol(split_entry[1]);    this->location = -1;}This is the parent constructor.Order::Order(std::string name, std::string entry){    std::string* split_entry;    if (4 < splitString(entry, &split_entry, '\t'))        this->buy = true;    else        this->buy = false;    if (split_entry[0] == "Station")        split_entry[0] = "-1";    else if (split_entry[0] == "System")        split_entry[0] = "0";    split_entry[1].erase(std::remove(split_entry[1].begin(), split_entry[1].end(), ','), split_entry[1].end());    Item(name, std::stol(split_entry[1]), std::stoi(split_entry[0]));    this->price = (int)(100 * std::stoi(split_entry[2]));    if (this->buy)    {        if (split_entry[4] == "Station")            split_entry[4] = "-1";        else if (split_entry[4] == "System")            split_entry[4] = "0";        this->range = std::stoi(split_entry[4]);        this->min_volume = std::stoi(split_entry[5]);    }}This is supposed to be the child constructor. They both get different strings, so I can't make an universal parseLine function, that was just an example.
You never told me what you were drinking.
>beer simulator.you should start a kickstarter to get money to do more research
I know it's messy and whatnot, but the logic works, I just need to sort the inheritance out.
Newky Brown and Paledog
Worst case you are making an extra copy of the iterator for each iteration of the loop.  Could be a pretty big deal depending on the complexity of the iterator object.Also depends on the compiler, I feel like those extra copies would be optimized out but I've never personally tested it.
Would you recommend a course for me to take? I understand the syntax of coding, but don't understand how this syntax will build small blocks that build applications.
Gonna ask a design question, but why does Item inherit from order? That's a many to one inheritance. Flip your inheritance.
>Also depends on the compiler, I feel like those extra copies would be optimized out but I've never personally tested it.Yeah, that's what prompted me to ask.Noice.
I'm impressed no one bitched about the image. That's a good sign.
Can /g/ write a program to reverse a String recursively?  I sure as fuck can't.
start with an introduction
def reverse(str: String): String = if (str isEmpty) "" else reverse(str substring 1) + str(0)
>helping a stupid fag with his homeworkshiggy
Anyone on this? I'm ending up with something that looks like this
for pseudo code but:string revrec(string s, int iter){ string temp = s.substr(0, s.length - 1); temp = s.substr(s.length - 1, s.length) + temp; if(--iter == 0)  return temp; else  return revrec(temp, iter);}string rev(string s){ return revrec(s, s.length);} 
code   def init_ui    vbox = Qt::VBoxLayout.new self    vbox1 = Qt::VBoxLayout.new    hbox1 = Qt::HBoxLayout.new    hbox2 = Qt::HBoxLayout.new    # windLabel = Qt::Label.new "Windows", self    # edit = Qt::TextEdit.new self    # edit.setEnabled false    activate = Qt::PushButton.new "Activate", self    close = Qt::PushButton.new "Close", self    help = Qt::PushButton.new "Help", self    ok = Qt::PushButton.new "Ok", self    lbl =  Qt::Label.new "Test", self    vbox.addWidget activate    vbox1.addWidget close    hbox1.addWidget help    hbox2.addWidget ok  endAre vboxes and hboxes like grids?
Order inherits from item. Item has the parameters name, quantity and location, order has a few more.
Give me an example of parameters you would pass to both?
If I want to initialize an order object, I would pass a string like "8 10,000 173.78 ISK Gaha IV - Moon 5 - Republic Security Services Assembly Plant 86d 13h 12m 55s". Parse it for the location, quantity, price. name is in a seperate string, all the names of the traded items are in a string array.And item order would get a string like "Damage Control I    1    Damage Control        Low    5 m3", where it would parse the name and quantity.If that's what you mean.
Meant to reply to
Congrats you can write unreadable code.>But muh one liners
it's fairly normal for scala
wow you suck if you honestly think that's unreadable.
It is absolutely fine.
Ok then tell me how this reverse(str substring 1) + str(0) gets incremented each call
each time you take the substring, you are cutting off a character
>Doesn't even understand recursion
There's nothing wrong with that code.
It usually involves graph traversals, shortest path algorithms, that sort of stuff.
So is Rails a mature framework these days?I know Ruby pretty well and I learned Rails for some time ago but it was lacking support for some pretty basic stuff like foreign keys. I took a look at it again and it's looking quite polished.Anyone here who works with it share an opinion on the latest version?

>Old style function declarations>Not declaring i in the for loopNo. Just no.
ThanksThank you
also>returning 0 explicitly
The return button was made for a reason, use it.
Depends on your use case. Rails is opinionated and will get an app minimally functional fast. As a freelancer working on small apps it was perfect. But if your needs are complex or you plan to scale much look elsewhere. Active record really slows things down but rails doesn't handle views well. Personally I'm abandoning rails and Ruby in favor of haskell and snap. It outperforms python and Ruby by a long shot, and it's less error prone than C++
Yeah. Rails seems to do a fuckton of things and gets bogged down by them.I've been thinking about using Go. Do you happen to know of a good, mature framework or is the language too new for that?
I've seen Haskell mostly by people shilling its features, but what are the practical applications for it?
>muh type-safe urls
Most of the large scale haskell stuff is closed source. But I belive whatsapp is haskell. It's becoming more popular thanks to yesod and snap. I'd say it's a very hard language to learn but it's strictness dramatically reduces bugs.
b-but haskell is lazy! :D
 ephemerial responses like this are why I haven't bothered with the language. Each language does something well, what is it for haskell?
it's so fucking warmit's literally like summer arrived overnightAnyway I'm fiddling with creating a "defer" function for C that modifies the code at run time... Probably not the best way to go about it.
Do 'transpilers' literally just run through a file of source and parse it, translating it to the target language?
I think https://revel.github.io/ is supposed to be Rails-like, but last time I looked for web frameworks a lot of people were of the opinion that when writing web apps in Go you should use smaller components rather than a full on framework. I think http://martini.codegangsta.io/ is supposed to be more like that, with small composable parts than you can pick and choose from instead of a full environment kind of deal.
I didn't mean strict in the way it evaluates things. It enforces constraints far more than imperative OO languages. Short of stuffing values into a Monad you really can't have side effects.
They transpire the source code through their pores after working hard.
Thank you!

That's just lolz.  Jesus.>solving a problem>breaking it down into a collection of subproblemsWe just called this program design in my heyday.  What are they doing to you kids, out there?
It will never be as popular as ruby , python, or java but I think the growing industry trend is toward functional programming. Eventually some functional language that may not even exist yet will become the industry standard. Concurrent and distributed processing are much easier when you don't have any mutable state.
I use it a lot at work for processing big old archives of legacy data. Typical "one time programming" style tasks where I need to build a report or create a database, and potentially further integrate it into primary databases. Fast development speed and the performance is quite good. At its best it runs blazingly fast through gigabytes of data with a tiny memory footprint thanks to its lazy streams. At its worst it eats up memory and falls over for some unclear reason. It can feel a bit like arcane incantations trying to get it to behave! The standard profiling tools are pretty good for diagnosing these issues though, absolute breeze to profile and get nice graphs and call information.
Dynamic programming has been a thing since before you were born.

>Eventually some functional language that may not even exist yet will become the industry standard.never it will happen, what you will see, like now, is mainstream languages integrating some functional stuffs (rust, d, c++ 11/14, java 8, scala, ...). purely functional is a dead end.>Concurrent and distributed processing are much easier when you don't have any mutable state.yeah,that's why there literally zero use of any functional programming language in HPC.that's why facebook ditched erlang for c++.that's why none of latest AAA games are done with a functional programming language despite those games are now heavily relying on multicore (and don't come with GOAL, it's an imperative language)
that's the most distressing thing I've seen on this website in quite some time
>that's why none of latest AAA games are done with a functional programming language despite >those games are now heavily relying on multicore (and don't come with GOAL, it's an imperative language)Because Erlang totally does graphics mate.
I...
>Solving a problem by breaking it down into subproblems has been a thing.You're right.  I can't disagree with you there.
does the compiler being 32 or 64 bit matter at all?
I don't get it.
no
>The term dynamic programming was originally used in the 1940s by Richard Bellman to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another. By 1953, he refined this to the modern meaning, referring specifically to nesting smaller decision problems inside larger decisions,[16] and the field was thereafter recognized by the IEEE as a systems analysis and engineering topic. Bellman's contribution is remembered in the name of the Bellman equation, a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in recursive form.

Are you going to be a freshman, i.e., is it going to be a first-year java course (jesus christ)? If so, why give up learning, just because you're using a different language? It's not like you'll stop using Python just because they're teaching Java. Unless you just started python and can barely fizzbuzz, I'd say keep going with it. I don't know python or java but I imagine it's much easier to write something up real quick in python

 Parent::Parent(number);>Tried that, linker error.That is because that attempts to call a non-existent static method called Parent.Unfortunately, if I have understood you, C++ doesn't have a way to do that.  If you take in a string that needs to be parsed, the only way you can do the parsing bits is in the constructor body.  You could consider making a static member that builds a Child (factory pattern).

I just finished my freshman year, about to start my second year in the fall. I can fizzbuzz, lmao.It really is a cool language, I fucking hate the divide between 2 and 3,and it's hard to find good resources for 3 like I can for 2.And right now I'm using diveintopython.
Can you not learn 2 things at once? If you're >starting< Java in the fall, it'll be basic stuff and simple data structures etc. Don't drop python just because your classes won't use it anymore
I can learn two things at once, I'm just a lazy fuck I guess. I should start learning java before the summer ends then.
Get a head-start anon, and always stay ahead. Makes shit easy. Classes should always be review.
Yo /dpt/, curious:What project of yours are you most proud of?
I appreciate the kind words, I have a really good understanding of what needs to be done. I'm hoping to be able to bang out like a weeks worth of homework in a couple hours for that class.Is there anything like this but for Python 3?

I'm fucking retarded, thanks. I just started skimming through the body.
Currently working on a BASIC compiler, but written in Java (no pun intended). It's proving to be a huge pain in the ass simply because of the memory management and control statements but its pretty fun.Then I'm going to work on a simple social media website and try to pick up the basics of JavaScript, CSS, PHP, etc. and MAYBE set up a LAMP server if I have the patience.Lastly, do a quick crash course on Python and C and finish K&R, then work on a sophisticated webcrawler using python or maybe make a web browser.
im in the same position as you. im going to be doing a lot of C and assembly next year, but only way we really use java is in android dev

I want to start getting into C because I have a big interest into hardware exploitation (things like badUSB etc.), along with wireless attack vectors. And Of course as a lower level language you can do some powerful stuff with C
Rookie here, why explicitly returning 0 is bad? Because instead of returning 0 you can just write your function to return nothing (void )?
>why explicitly returning 0 is bad?Nothing, its just unnecessary.C99 and C11 specify that reaching the end of main means that you returned 0.
define powerful stuff
its just the memory management. its like how java will throw exceptions and shit when you fuck up but in C you can literally go over an array's "alloted" length and go fuck around. ive also seen primitive viruses written in C (which is a pretty big deal seeing how most are written in assembly).idk bro C is pretty fucking hard to get a good hang of. im more likely going to stick to python so I can actually get shit done and be helped by the interpreter instead of getting 0 info
Hi /b/. I want you to train my recurrent neural network. Link me to a website (e.g., reddit.com/r/movies or even 4chan.org/g/) and I'll crawl it for content. I'll post sample output strings as the machine learns how to talk in the voice of that website (e.g., it didn't take long to learn the word nigger when I crawled pol). Dubs gets to pick what corpus I use, or if I see something really interesting I'll use that.
> /b/I'll let it slide.Train it on jezebel articles.

Seconded.http://jezebel.com/So, how does this work, OP? I'm interested in neural networks, but don't know how your specific one would work.
Tibetan Book of Deadhttp://www.summum.us/mummification/tbotd/toc.shtml
Made the rounds over the weekend:http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/
Ah. Cool. I'll give it a read later.Neural networks are certainly pretty baller. I intend to really study them sometime, but right now I've only screwed around without making a serious study of the subject.
Okay, spinning 'er up.
How long does it take to train?
What did you use to make it?
See: 
Oh, so you're the guy that made that.I guess all good things do trickle down from 4chan after all...
god, jezebel has so much garbage markup. working on cleaning it up with lynx and regex.
No. I'm not OP, and I don't believe OP made that. I think OP is just using their code.OP, could you clarify?
hours for really good results, minutes for amusing results
I'm not the guy who wrote that awesome article. I was inspired to use his code, though.
Jezebel has garbage *everything*, so that's hardly surprising. Gawker is fucking disgusting.if you really want to hate your computer, train it to write Feministing. Jezebel is crap, but it's kind of wimpy. Feministing is pedal-to-the-metal ranting about rape and triggers 24/7. Jezebel is like a shitty diner, while Feministing is like old carrion.
Can someone explain to a poor ole newfag like me what a neutral network is?
Now I'm tempted to re-implement the code on GPU. Training neural networks is very well suited to GPU implementations since it's vector-based and uses lots of floating point arithmetic.I really should learn OpenCL properly. Right now I only really know CUDA in any real depth. I think CUDA is better than OpenCL, but it's also proprietary and Nvidia-only.
that site triggered me.Managed to clean up Jezebel and have a corpus of actual content 260k in size after removing 44 megabytes of garbage.It's running now. I'll post in a few minutes after a few hundred iterations.
The open source code he provided does use the GPU, though you can point it at a CPU. I'm training it on a AMD Radeon R9 M370X, not super beasty but the best I got and his code doesn't run on Windows.
>http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/
You have a neuron. This neuron has a vector, called its weights. This neuron takes a vector as input. Its output is g(input) = f(weights * input), where * is the dot product and f is usually some sigmoid function.You can create a layer of these neurons. These neurons take a vector as input. They give a vector of output, which is a vecot made out of g(input) for each neuron.Now you can make multiple layers. The output of each layer feeds into the next layer.What this means is you can take a vector, feed it into the first layer, feed the first layer into the second, and so on, and get a vector out of the other side.You can now automatically find appropriate weights for the neurons using certain techniques. This means that the final output reveals some pattern in the input. For example, if you want to identify handwriting you can feed the image in as your input vector and you will get output which will tell you the probability of it being each letter.Does that make some sense?
Looks like it uses Torch, right?I don't know Torch, sadly.
So it scans an image and tells you what it is?

That's a dramatic oversimplification. It can take any input and give any output. It could identify audio or steer a car. It could upscale an image while preserving detail.This program trains a network which will learn to write like its input. It will learn to write Jezebel articles. I don't know why you would want to automatically write Jezebel articles, but this will let you.
So AI?
Yes. Though most people don't like the term AI anymore, it does fit. It learns from data.

>using MPC-HC>2015MPC-HC can't even stream as well as VLC can. It's a piece of shit. mpv plays everything that MPC-HC and VLC does and more. Why haven't you switched to the objectively superior video player known as mpv, /g/?
What do you even gain from shilling for free software against other free software? What's the point of these threads?
reported for shilling stupid MPV dev
Precisely, shithead. It's not shilling. It's just telling people that MPC-HC is fucking dead, which it is. Fact: mpv is the best video player available to /g/.
I don't get it, is mpv a /g/ project or do we just like shilling for it because it's hip and new?
>MPC-HCWindows only, therefore obsolete.>VLCGood for DLNA/network shit, but I don't use it.>mpv The best media player available on GNU/Linux, so that's what I use.
He's mad people aren't using his shit media player that requires editing a bunch of config files instead of having a proper menu.Why don't you work on a UI instead of shilling your shit program, op?
>Radio buttons and checkboxes buried under panels and tabs of shit>No explanation for what the option does, besides a tooltip, if thatA config file is much cleaner and easier to manage than a piece of shit GUI menu. Hell, I bet you don't even know what half of those options do. With mpv, you can at least get a good idea of how the option is affecting the playback or program by reading the manual. Fuck off with your Windows logic.
There's literally nothing wrong with config files.
>he needs to manually config a basic software in order to get to work so he gets 0.0000000001% of optimization in his already high end hardware, not mention that nowadays even some shitty hardware from late 00s can run your chinese cartoons and 14gb BR shit
Not really, no. But when you are working with a GUI based system then it is best to have a GUI based interface.Config files let you change settings if some setting you changed causes the program not to load anymore, that's always a bonus, but you can do the same with MPC-HC anyway.>Hell, I bet you don't even know what half of those options do.You'd have to be more retarded than you are to be unable to read.
>Not manually configuring every program installed on your computer for max optimization and usabilityWindows users, everyone.
>meme player>no settings GUI>inferior renderer
Its a goddamn media player, not a system/networking application you autist.
All the more reason why it should be configured manually. You want to enable features you want and disable the ones you don't need. Honestly, it takes fucking 5 minutes to do.
Changing all those settings would take maybe 15 seconds on MPC-HC.On MemePV, it would literally take you about an hour just reading the manual, locating the config line, making changes, making sure you closed edit brackets, then hoping everything will work. That's assuming MemePV even has that many settings.

Like what?
>shilling>for free softwareThis is how retarded you sound.
You obviously don't know what the word shill means.
You're wrong. Looking up an option in the manual and implementing it into a config file you've already edited a few times takes three minutes; ten minutes tops if you're not comfortable with config files and man pages yet. Changing an option via GUI takes five seconds.I ask this for clarity: are you stuck on the ceiling and forced to operate your computer with a stick?
MPV is cancer
Your shitty MPC-HC is cancer. I'm glad it's dying.

MPV is pretty good, but do we really need to have this same thread posted every day? There's really not a ton to talk about.
there is when you have autism apparently
>MPV is pretty good, but do we really need to have this same thread posted every day?The mpv devs are in full shill mode. I'm considering boycotting mpv now.
I see this thread everyday. You should keep working on your shit program rather than shitpost on /g/ all day.
You don't have to be running the latest build of everything to have no issues mate.In fact the latest builds may introduce new issues.Fact is that some issues are so particular that it is rare to come across them, some changes are to fix potential problems, some changes are purely cosmetic, some updates add features that you won't use anyway.I am still using LAV, I am still using MadVR, my videos are still rendered as good as they possibly can be, my subtitles are still rendered properly, my audio is still correctly decoded.What more do I need? 0.5% less CPU utilization? I'll survive.
>implying this thread was created by a devThe only mpv dev that frequents /g/ is Haasn and, like any self respecting person, he thinks it's cancerous.

>30 reasons mpv is objectively shit compared to MPC-HCYou can't even come up with 1.
No benefit.
Because mpv is garbage on Windows
this is actually a pretty solid argument.  adobe reader has introduced hundreds of bugs and vulnerabilities that they more or less refuse to fix because of the introduction of features that are never used by most users.
I'm convinced that these threads are made by the same troll who's constantly shitting on mpv in the non-bait threads.  The idea is to stack the thread with MPC-HC apologists and provide an excuse for counter-baiting.  Meanwhile, better threads are not made because everyone is already posting in here.

hello advertiser, how's your day?
I just timed it, it took me precisely 6 seconds to open up a terminal, type vim .mpv/config, navigate to a new line, insert op=faggot and then save+close the file.
>I'm considering boycotting mpv now.Haasn here. Please do this. This is exactly what happens when software gets popular, and it needs to end.Can we let mpv stay obscure and underground, please?
>my videos are still rendered as good as they possibly can beThe level of ignorance required to genuinely believe something like this is simply astounding.
Even if MPV was better then MPC, how would you get people to move over? It's already hard enough to get people to move over to MPC from VLC. How the fuck are you gonna get people to use an even more obscure and harder to use piece of software?
I actually just link them to https://github.com/suhteevah/mpvhq-win64 and then they download it and use it to play videos.It's not exactly rocket science.
wow so you mean it is quick and easy to do something you already know how to do?great job you proved your point and saved the day, let me go tell my 12 year old cousin to just go to the github and download mpv then, I'm sure he'll have it running in 6 secondsOr perhaps you are this dumb and literally and nonironically expect every computer user on the planet to be familiar with paths and config files
Nobody cares about your 12 year old cousin, least of all mpv users.
I don't know if this is some meme generation thing, /g/ groupies are always the worst, but I don't remember the MPC vs VLC being this autistic
MPC would take over if it were that easy.
If your 12 year old cousin is too retarded to be able to press the “download” button on a website, then I have serious concerns about the genetics present in your extended family.
>Nobody cares about your 12 year old cousinNiether do MPC devs or users, but the difference is, my 12 year old cousin can and does use MPC because it's not retarded and has a UI that a literal 12 year old can use>press the “download” button>I just timed it, it took me precisely 6 seconds to open up a terminal, type vim .mpv/config, navigate to a new line, insert op=faggot and then save+close the fileOf course, mpvfags are too stupid and delusional to follow a reply chain and just debate convenient points like calling a 12 year old dumbHow mature and rational the fanbase is. MemePV for the meme generation.
That's nice, I hope Timmy enjoys his videos :^)
This threads are obvious bait because he can't come up with good reasons why MPV is better.Better performance? Nope.Better image quality? Nope.Better UI? Nope.More robust settings? Nope.Keep shilling.  Keep jerking to allegedly being able to play esoteric files made for brazillians.
anime, minecraft, and youtube downloaded videos, like all the 12 year olds

And /g/ is barely anyone. No one wants to go through that shit.
your fault for using a shit os
>Haasn here.Who the fuck are you?
Meme lover and a madvr developer.
>mfw mpvfags are incompetent of writing a simple GUI that writes settings in their precious text config file
If I am streaming I use my web browser or phone. MPC-HC is the best for playing video files that I have on my PC, which is all that I want it to do anyway.
One of the few people on /g/ contributing to mpv.
>mfw you're "incompetent" of English
nice ad hominem  fag
>my videos are still rendered as good as they possibly can beThis is plain wrong
The word you're looking for is "incapable", you fucking incompetent.
Learn what an ad hominem is before you go running your mouthProtip: it's not anything that qualifies as an insult
>Implying a GUI configurer is even neededFuck off, Winbabby.
MPC was hard to configure at first, then with the inclusion of LAV filters it became much easier, still harder than mpvmpv works great out of the box, literally uncompress the build somewhere and drag&drop videos on the executable, if you want more placebo you only have to add a line to the config file, or two, or just copy a premade one from /g/You still have to install a few other plugins to get MPC-HC to work right, and configure them
Better performance? Nope.Yes, mpv avoids the mess that DirectShow is>Better image quality? Nope.Yes, it has properly implemented scalers and substantially better color management>Better UI? Nope.Subjective as fuck>More robust settings? NopeYes, a few lines in a config file than a bunch of menus and submenus in different programs
>Implying mpv has a better renderer than madvr
MPC-HC works right after an install. Nothing else is needed.
It does, yCMS is shit, LCMS is much better, and it actually has proper scalers that can be configuredmpv as well, but to have the features that mpv has you need to install madVR, ReClock and xy-vsfilter, and configure them (though the only one that you actually need to configure is madVR)
Yeah, OpenGL. Now, fuck off with your proprietary shit.
>xy-vsfilterget with the times grandpa
>OpenGLenjoy your tearing and no drivers
Only on Windows :^)
I get by just fine with MPC-HC and nothing additional.
Why not just use WMP?
Nobody cares about your shitty pleb tastes and lack of understanding about video quality.
I reallt think mpv should drop Windows support. They are a group that you don't want to target your software for, since the majority of Windows users are low IQ shitheads. >Where's my GUI????>Why do I need to configure in plain-text? That's so hard!!!!>I don't care about freedom! Stupid freetards!!!

No it turnes it off. My asshole friends did it twice to me now. Both times they sent it it turned off.
I tried it to myself, girlfriend and buddy. Did not turn off. All different iPhone models (4S, 5c and 5s).

>taking the baityou're both retarded
It works because, when the iPhone shortens the message for the preview, it ends trying to cut an arabic character in half since arabic characters aren't stored the same way normal text is.The first two lines exist purely to push the other text down. You can put in whatever you like as long it's on two lines.
now I'd be pretty interested in fixing this shit.
It's called multibyte characters.. A lot of languages use them.
If they have another app open, their phone shuts off. If they have messaging open, they're in the clear. I'm pretty sure it has to do with the message preview.
>fix shit>on a closed source prison OSgood jokeYou're powerless to fix anything yourself, you just have to keep giving money to Applel and hope they wipe your arse for you.
This doesn't work for me or anyone I sent it to.Is this just a reddit troll or something?
What if there are other ways to use this message exploit? Like instead of having the phone reset, have all the apps factory reset?
Watch them release an iOS update that every user will hate, but, users will still somehow justify using a phone that could be turned off by a text.
Someone reported that arabic characters crashed Safari on iPhone for them when I posted some Koran verse on another board.

My friend is real pissed at me right now. Hahahaha.
Yes and you gotta turn the other phone off really fast so the message will get queued and only delivered to your iphone  when you turn it on. You done fucked up tho by sending it to yourself. If you have Yosemite you can try using the Continuity feature to send texts to yourself using your Mac. However be careful as that message might blow up your Mac as well
Use Siri dumbass
You have to get the text from the same number you idiot. It won't clear the preview if its in another thread.
nah when I load my messages app it still shows the recent contact list, and the most recent message from each. I tried using a friend to message me, but I need to change the most recent message from my own number.Can't you faggots think logically?

Would this bug also work with emoji flags whuch are also multi-byte characters?
So can one automatically fix this crash or does the message app remain crashed until apple patches the bug
It worked, thanks again.
Lol. Also, you can fix it by sending a message through iphoto.
Fuck, i texted this to myself and I can't open my messages app. wtf do I do?
you can fix it by sending a picture to the person who sent the message and then deleting the message apparently
The sender can send another message to fix it, or the victim can send themselves a photo

If you receive one of these messages, there are a few possible fixes that have worked for us and for other people who have encountered the bug. If the Messages app was opened to the conversation with the person who sent the offending message, the Messages app can be reopened to this conversation. Sending a reply message fixes the problem. If Messages was opened to the conversation list view, the app will crash when you attempt to open it. You can fix this by having someone send you a message or by sending a message to yourself. There are several options for sending a message to yourself, including sending yourself a message via Siri or through the Share sheet in any app. To send yourself a message in Siri, tell Siri to "Send a message to myself." Siri will open up a dialogue where you can give her a quick message like "Fix" that'll be sent to your iPhone to clear away the malicious message. Alternatively, you can open an app like Notes, craft a quick note, and use the Share option (the little document with an arrow) to message it to yourself. Sending yourself something though the share sheet of an app opens a new messages window where you can enter your own contact information.

I've lost a couple of months worth of jpg files, which is very annoying. But any jpgs older than that are backed up here and there. It's mainly a time consuming annoyance.

I heard Tor is a honeypot now.What do I use instead for deepweb shit then?
> Tor is a honeypotThis can mean two things:1. There's a backdoor that nobody has discovered in the Tor source code yet.2. One of the Tor Hidden Services was accessed by the government, and instead of "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.onion is a honeypot" everyone says "Tor is a honeypot".Use Tor safely. Use PORTAL if you're really concerned.https://github.com/grugq/PORTALofPi
what do people do on the weep deb?
Buy drugs, CCVs and download CP.
>2. One of the Tor Hidden Services was accessed by the government, and instead of "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.onion is a honeypot" everyone says "Tor is a honeypot".If the government gained access to a major .onion site(several times now), then what makes you think any other .onion site is safe? 'sys op mistakes' and 'social engineering'. I just don't buy it. A recent onion site was apparently being ran by the government for a fucking year and everyone was clueless. You'd have to be retarded to think tor is safe
what is ccv i don't want to google it
Search it on ddg over Tor then :^)
Why are you giving an .onion site your personal data?The whole point of Tor is to give you an anonymous IP address. If you're going to broadcast your personal details over this anonymous connection like a faggot, then of course you're going to get thrown in jail with bubba
>But I even payed the hitman in bitcoins!  How could they possibly track it?
>Why are you giving an .onion site your personal data?Where in that sentence did I mention anything about personal data being used.
If you're not entering personal data, there's no additional data from you requesting the page alone.  So how would that be a honeypot?  Normal hidden services can't see any info about you unless you enter it.

Hi there!You seem to have made a bit of a mistake in your post. Luckily, the users of 4chan are always willing to help you clear this problem right up! You appear to have used a tripcode when posting, but your identity has nothing at all to do with the conversation! Whoops! You should always remember to stop using your tripcode when the thread it was used for is gone, unless another one is started! Posting with a tripcode when it isn't necessary is poor form. You should always try to post anonymously, unless your identity is absolutely vital to the post that you're making!Now, there's no need to thank me - I'm just doing my bit to help you get used to the anonymous image-board culture!
>there's no additional data from you requesting the page aloneYou don't know that with certainty.I don't trust anything tor related after all these constant seizes. >rarely anyone ever gets v&Except for the guy that owns it..Just like Shannon Mccoole's site.(owner).They arent interested in regular joes. The point is if they wanted to they probably could.
Do you understand how Tor works?  To de-anonymize someone you need a significant portion of the Tor relays.  Such an attack is possible, but what you mentioned is individual hidden services being taken over.  Even if every hidden service in the world is actually run out of Obama's basement if they don't have access to the relays they still don't know who you are.
Buying with bitcoins is still a very bad idea, since it's not really anonymous [1], so if the hitman or drug dealer is actually a fed you're fucked.[1]: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity
>To de-anonymize someone you need a significant portion of the Tor relaysThat's the most commonly known method, yes.Do other methods exist? You won't know for a long time from now. You can talk about how safe you technically think tor is all you want, and it won't mean anything.>individual hidden services being taken overAnd I'm saying the way in which they were seized is controversial and doesn't add up.I could obviously go into detail about why it doesn't make sense, but 4chan has become too shitty to talk in depth about such subjects.Use tor all you like, I'm never touching it again.
am i still anonymous if i'm uploading or downloading something from tor
>I could obviously go into detail about why it doesn't make sensePlease do.  I don't mean that in a smartass smug way, I'm genuinly curious.  Do you think there's a backdoor obfuscated somewhere in the Tor code?  Is there some side-channel nobody's thinking about?The most believable explanation to me is that individual sites were busted from outside information.  Silk Road is an example of extremely poor opsec, but even one minor slip-up is enough to possibly give away your location.

How many of you fell for the Thinkpad meme?I bought an x230t a year and a half ago, and sold it after around nine months. I now own a Haswell XPS 12 and like it much more.
Long story short, I was at my college's library and left my t520 unattended for a few minutes. When I got back I saw a Hispanic running out the room with my Thinkpad. Being the autist that I am, I became really depressed and started crying. A few hours later I received a call from the school saying someone had found my laptop and brought it to the lost and found. What seems to have happened was the guy was trying to use it but couldn't figure out what the fuck was going on, probably thinking it was worthless/broken so he just brought it to the lost and found to avoid criminal charges.
same reason manual cars are less stolen
wow, never thought I'd see the day that linux was actually useful
Why would someone use Loo nucs for anything but a server?
Should have cried louder to get everyone's attention on the thief
>I was at my college's library and left my t520 unattended for a few minutesMy little anon couldn't be this pleb. I see normalfags doing this all the time, and I couldn't even imagine leaving my laptop in the "care" of random strangers.

Generally if you wear a fedora people don't want to touch the things you own.
Your first mistake was not shooting him.
Don't you people have to learn how to drive manual cars on the US?I though every country in the world made you learn on manual ones to get your license.
This is why I use twinfish full disk encryption on all of my computers.

>I though every country in the world made you learn on manual ones to get your license.How if you don't own a manual? Should they give you a free practice car to learn in too? :^)

>Should they give you a free practice car to learn in too? :^)Considering these people all live in socialist 'utopias' and think everything should be 'free', they'd probably say yes.
They simply issue you a license that says you're only allowed to drive automatics.
You deserved to have it stolen, retard.
Such stale old pasta...
>hispanics>in collegefake
Well here in Brazil you gotta pay classes (Take at least some 15 hrs of theory [i think, may be more] + driving tests) to get your license and you're obligated to learn how to drive on a manual car.You don't need to own a car previously to get a license, you use the "auto school" one. So if you know how to drive an manual you sure as hell know how to drive an auto.
>Don't you people have to learn how to drive manual cars on the US?been licensed driving for 15 years, I've never learned to drive manualthen again, I'm not about that whole "pure driving experience" thing that a lot of aut/o/s like to spout
^thisare you SURE it wasn't actually a nigger?
>Don't you people have to learn how to drive manual cars on the US?You realize maybe 90-95% of cars sold in the states are automatics, right? There's no point in them learning manual when they'll never encounter one ever.
>linux's use is to be useless to 99.9% of the population
Can't you just bribe your way to a license? I don't think licenses should even be required to drive tbh
>Can't you just bribe your way to a license?Not worth it, if you have time to spare you can get your license in 5 days.If you bribe your way to it or get a fake one you can get arrested for a somewhat long time.
Why does manual still exist? >I sure do enjoy doing things that can be done automatically for me but choose to do it the hard wayThese people must use linux...
I think it's because they can sell auto as a premium?It can't be that much harder to manufacture, maybe there are licensing/approval costs?Sounds like a bait topic for /o/
>It can't be that much harder to manufacture, maybe there are licensing/approval costs?Automatics are complicated as fuck. Pic related, they're pretty much mechanical computers (at least before they WERE computerized) and this is only a small part of the mess.With this level of complexity, it's hard to imagine that they work at all.
All of this impotent sperging could have been avoided with one of these.

You live right next to a freedom state. Move to AZ. I'm moving to PA so I can experience freedom, as soon as I finish school, that is.
Why PA? What part? Can't you buy a cheap used gun from a pawn shop or a stolen gun from mexicans?

>Why PA? What part?Fewer car laws than NJ, and pretty much no gun laws in comparison to NJ.I like my rights respected.
I'm hispanic and there's plenty of scummy hispanics, if anything I'm surprised OP showed restraint and didn't say 'I saw a spic running out the room with my thinkpad'. struck me as a very liberal thing to do "sure, he took something very valuable to me but I wouldn't like to call him mean stuff."
This.I do this for short bathroom breaks, never had a problem.Plus, full encrypted hdd, backups, and a used thinkpad that's on the cheap end means I don't worry a huge amount.

Because performance, and fuel efficiency. It's like Linux vs OSX, some people like complete control of their shit instead of being a babby that requires a magic box to solve things they can't do.
>tfw live in NJ>Can't use any weapons to legally defend myself on the street from criminals.
Shooting someone for grabbing your computer? You just turned a small monetary loss into years in prison.
Fuck off, moran.
>I like my rights respected.Yeah, yeah. Gun control has been ruled constitutional time and time again. It does not violate any of your legal rights.You COULD argue carrying weaponry is a fundamental human right, but that's just fucking stupid. And even if it were true, no ethical theory I know of says rights are absolute.
Excellent! We don't need nutjobs firing weapons in crowded areas while trying to murder people for petty theft.
Obviously OP has some very cheesy pizza on his computer. Those years in prison are nothing compared to what he would receive had someone actually gotten into his computer.
but manual is soooo much more fun to drive, wtf usa?

OP should encrypt his files. Having cheese pizza is not even close to as wrong as murder, but the US justice system is nuts and people have been sentenced to 300+ years in prison w without parole for possession of CP without actually harming a single child.That wasn't OP's post, though. That was OneSlowGTP, who is either a troll or a crazy, stupid, and evil son of a bitch. OP seems decent enough, though crying over a stolen laptop is kind of pathetic.
That depends. Obviously a sports car should be manual, but automatic is much easier. Automatic is more relaxing, I guess.Are those figures accurate? I have never driven an automatic car, so I find them hard to believe.
>Why the fuck wouldn't you pursue him and attack him with your autism strength?This.  I chased down a thief and got my shit back.>attend expensive private school>can leave your shit out in the open for days and no one will touch it
Clarification: there was ONE case of someone getting 500 years for possessing CP with no evidence he had ever harmed a minor.People do get 25+ year prison sentences for CP pretty regularly, though, and the length of sentences has increased dramatically in recent years. The mandatory minimum sentence for a first offense of receiving CP is 5 years.

Guys, are the K7XX any better than K702's?
Yes. I think we should switch them in op guide.
Err, meant to say swap.
reminder that the Fidelio X2 masterrace is currently £170 @ Amazon.it
I apologise for my autism, but since they're on amazon.it you should say 240€.
Are these really worth it? I'm really tempted.
>Nigga bass asidei doubt you would be disapointed, it's a great headphone for the price and, for many, the first good step in heapdhones world.
They are very good if you like a warm headphone. One of the best choices in the ~250euro bracket
After doing a little research I'd say not really no. The newer K702's apparently use the same driver as the Q701's. It'll just come down to preference.
>No subjecthow hard is that Op?
Tell us about your headphones.Too basic.My bad.Full sized should surround the ear with large pads, on ear rest the pads on the ear.
Good afternoon /hpg/, how are you guys today?
Yes it should, meh bad
Alright, which is a better purchase: Fidelio X2 or the Sennheiser HD 650. I'm currently using a pair of Grado sr325's, and I'm growing tired of how bright they are.
X2 if you don't have an amp.It's probably better either way.
doing good so far
Okay, so they're back on my list.I just went to a local Music Store(Guitar Center) and fell in love with their selection of headphones. I shoulda asked if they had some other ones available for testing.
i think everyone can guess what this thread is about anon
Yes but it can be a pain to find from the catalog, especially for new people.
evenin' boys
The smh-1000's are nice and bright, whille having very clear sound. IM-02 was balanced, and achieved high comfort, isolation, and clarity, which is what i loved about these. Jays one+ were bass heavy while balancing quality and quantity for the bass, mid, and highs.
I have this and they sound like crap, are not very comfortable, my old technics headphones for like $50 sound betterthey do look good and are quite stylish, I wear them on the train, also dat noise canceling
audio technica msr7 is said to be a straight-up upgrade from those, even looks the same and is cheaper
Is the MDR7506 worth? Is there a superior option for the same price?
Get the senal smh-100s the same0. Same sound sig, removable cable, looks the same, and has better clarity.
no measurements.
Has anyone tried the Knowledge Zeniths yet? I ordered a couple pairs. head-fi seems impressed by them
Once /hpg/ suggested me the JVC FXT-100: no reviews exist except a thread on shill-fi, and you find only pages in japanese while searching them on google: at least while looking for the SMH-100 google gives you pages in english!
2 hour later. Finally sound "s" and cymbals don't pierce my ears.
You need to set your overall gain to -14
pretty shy on the sub bass
put preamp to -14you can experiment on the filters too.
Haven't posted in a while
Will do when I'll buy an amp.
Thoughts on the K550?
Why the 10Hz.Why not just use a shelving EQ?
Pls be gentle
I enjoy them, but I dislike the pleather pads so the Q701s get more head time.Mine have been modified with a new removable cable and silver plated copper internalsIt can be hard to get a good seal for maximum isolation and bass. A lot of fussing around with the gimbals.Sound is good, on the warmer side of neutral, but not as warm as bass port modded Q701.idk I like V-shaped headphones because I'm a pleb

Massdrop currently has the AKG K7xx for $200 are they worth picking up?
It's almost like no one in these autism threads actually knows what they're talking about!
Or maybe it's so subjective that it's hard to tell who is going to prefer what!
Most people on /hpg/ generally agree on what are good and bad headphones.You have most likely been the target of shilling.Just take a look at the $200+ headphones guide we made. It should be pretty solid.
how do you guys take care of your headphone cables? do you wrap them in a coil and use velcro, braid them, etc..? how should i store them to ensure longevity?
Head-Fi is the last place to look if you don't know how to wade through the bullshit snake oil.You have to know where and how to look, try looking at measurements and what objective information you can source before asking people for opinions. Obviously the -best- way would be to go and audition but that's also very hard to adequately doThere are also some reviewers who don't exist to shill overpriced crap, like Zeos (for budget gear) and I imagine some others. Tyll does measurements but he also clearly throws in some shilling here and there
Anyone know some smartphone with nice audio qyality? I'm talking about iphone 4 or htc one audio qualityIs lgg2 audio good?

Don't fall for some 'audiophile' quality smartphone, they should all be relatively the same in this regard. I imagine iPhones would be pretty decent here because some of Apple's iPhones had decent to good DACs in them
>tfw I don't understand those fancy rainbow coloured 3D graphs but I still want good quality audio at home
When it comes to budget there is a severe lack of measurements, especially with chinese brands. If you only did that you'd never discover gems like Takstars

I know exactly that feel. It's been a week for me now. The more I read, the more confused I get: it seems there's no way to find out what might be the optimal way to spend your money.>try looking at measurementsThey're easily understandable. However they rarely tell the whole picture.>and what objective information you can source before asking people for opinionsIt's simply not possible. Period. For instance, here's something I'm reading right now:I was looking for a better or step up than old M50 so based on so many good reviews online, inner fidelity and amazon I ordered NAD HP50.For the price point this should be good or better alternative to my old M50 as in house or outdoor listening. >I got the HP50 today and these are my first out of the box impression: (mostly vs M50)>better comfort>louder>sounds warmer than M50 ( i thought M50 was warmer)>mids and high are too dark>good bass not too boomy but less extended>forward sound - more in your face>narrower sound stage than M50>the worst .....sounds FLAT way less dynamic. Music don't sound alive.WHICH IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'VE READ UNTIL NOW ABOUT THE HP50 GOD FUCKING DAMN IT!
>I read a bunch of non-empirical, anecdotal reviews and was surprised when reality didn't reflect them

I'm trying to read the highest number of anecdotal reviews in order to tell personal impressions from shared perceptions. Then things like the review I've pasted pops up and it's literally opposite in every single point to whatever I've read until now: the point is not "why is he telling something different from what I was expecting", the point is "how is that possible that there's NOTHING in common with any other review?".>That was a terrible assumption to makeThe iterative process is the following:>set a list of conditions (in my case: closed and portable, good soundstage, balanced)>see what the market offers>exclude those that cost too much (a.k.a. set a maximum budget)>start reading reviews and comparatives>start all over again with new more strict conditions based on your findings' characteristicsIn my case I've narrowed the choice to two headphones, however this algorithm starts looping when reading reviews and comparatives, because you learn about other headphones that seem to fit your requirements.>Are these even possible?No it isn't. From what I've read HP should be slightly warm, but overall flat, with excellent soundstage. Don't know about the M50 since I can find only the M50x on the market, so I read reviews only of this latter model.
>I thought about picking up a pair of 7506s. What do you guys think?Sure, but you should know it's a sidegrade. You have to save up more money if you want an upgrade that's also neutral.

I don'r read into the average reviewer's statements about sound. I don't know what they like. It is usually fine for sonething that requires less training, such as comfort or build issues or somethng.

The HE90+HEV90 stands out as an especially poor value and prone to scammers.The HD 800 is tuned very differently from the HE90, that much will be very evident.Don't mistake price for sound quality, and this runs both ways.
>definitely isn't worth the 30k they are going for these daysThats because it is a hardcore collector headphone today.Denon AH5000 cost like $600-1000 and it is nowhere near worth that much.Same story with AKG K1000.
Even at their original price the Orpheus price doesn't reflect their sound quality. Maybe it did it the early 90s, certainly not now. Back then their RRP was higher than a current SR-009 with BHSE and that doesn't account for inflation
I got a pair of a40s for free without the mixamp would I need to get a mixamp to use them as a simple headset + mic combo for chatting with my m8s?They came with literally no cables and im not sure if they mixamp is required to use the microphone.
Hi dad
Sell them to a retard and buy something that sounds a bit better than a $5 set of headphones
If you're willing to go a little more expensive and a small amount of sound leakage, the Koss PotaPros are a godsend for the price and portability. They're  a little base heavy, but not too much. This helps keep them functional in a high noise environment.
Sennheiser 598s are on sale on Amazon for $150 right now.I have the 558s, great for gaming and music.
If you have the HD 558, you should surely know that there is no difference between that and 598 after you have foam modded it.
>not suggesting 558 and to mod them when they're like $120 on Amazon>instead suggesting more expensive, uglier headphone that sounds identical to modded 558
But I want earphones, I already have an Audio Technica ATH-AD700X. Thanks though.
In ear monitors, you want iems. the xiaomi piston 2.
I-I totally knew about the mod.
Missed that part, sorry.
>mostly for transportation/work>even suggesting something as hideous as theseWhy is it you're looking for alternatives to the ones in the guide?
Because I'm looking for a seller in ebay, since I got a $10 discount coupon, and most of the sellers there are chinese, which take months to deliver to my shitty 3rd world country.
They are tiny, sound great for the price, and comfortable as fuck. That fits the transportation criteria perfectly. I think that beats may be more your style
To the anon comparing portapro bass to 7506/v6 bass, on paper it's significantly less but the perception is that the v6 actually has more bass, to me anyways. maybe it's down to just the pressure that a closed headphone has or the tightness and punch of the v6 bass, but I personally find them bassier than the portapro. the portapro has a more traditional dark sound, it sounds a bit "thick", as if it's bass emphasis is spread across more of the bass frequency range. the v6 has much more bass impact.
I get my T70 tomorrow, they'll replace my old DT770 Pro. They're still great but I had money to spend, and still have, should I buy the ASUS STX I or II? Is there any difference? I need perfect quality for gaming/movies/music.
How do the Piston 3 compare to 2.0 or 2.1?
Are your Q701's balanced? If so, did you do them yourself and how hard was it?
Get an O2 if you want perfect quality.It's the most transparent amp on the market.
>silver plated copper Urgh, that's bad. UP-OCC or bust.
I spent the last hour cutting up packaging material to stuff in earpads. I'm pretty satisfied with the results. Probably going to buy one of those wool headband cushions from china for my m40x and other headphones.

I know it's bad but nothing turns me on that a nicely braided UP-OCC litz copper cable.
Oh I won't deny they attractive as hell. I'm definitely considering making my own cables in a similar style because I like the look but don't like the price tag

HP1000 are worth owning if you can get them for around $1000-1500. Above that they're overpriced. They're very neutral and detailed for a Grado headphone and have a less forward sound.

It changes the phase of the driver by reversing the current flow. Mostly used for old recordings where the polarity is wrong or if there is a ground hum through your audio system, otherwise it's useless. It's easy to drive like most Grados yes.
I have both, and they are pretty equal. Other guy is right, it's a sidegrade. I think the 7506s are a little more neutral, but I don't think it's worth your shekels.

Efficiency is measurable!You put in a certain amount of electric power and you measure it with a wattmeter.You collect a certain amount of acoustic power and you measure it with a sound meter.You divide these two numbers and you have the fucking efficiency: under a certain threshold they're inefficient, thus they need an amp, over a certain threshold the do not. Between two middle values you can say that they can be used without an amp, even though it's not recommended.If you don't have those numbers you shut the fuck up and let the numbers speak for themselves! It's that fucking simple!

Here, straight from the box.
Before you even bother to post your photo>trusting measurements from the company selling you the product
Not to make it sound like money will fix all your problems, but if the head hopes you but are THAT bad (which they probably aren't) you can always upgrade later.
It's not that simple. Some amps you have to crank the volume up to hear all the details while some do not, obviously there is something else going on there that is not readily measurable.
I think that everyone's first "audiophile" headphone should be the Grado Sr80's. They are incredible for the price. Grado cans generally tend to be on the bright side, with punchy base. They are flawed enough that they let the listener learn a lot about what they do and don't like. The only thing that may not suit you is that they are open air and star to get uncomfortable at the three hour mark.
you just wanted to say something negative
Evening, lads. I should do the template later on but I'm more of a portable guy.
Gonna go spend $800 on an amplifier for my $200 headphones now because -some day- I will buy some better headphones, it's just future proofing right?

Those two things trounce my old $100 Class A headphone amp ($1600 new) and old free Class AB receiver ($100 new).The experience just makes me just want to chase headphones rather than DAC/amp after a certain point though.
I really, really like the WooAudio WA6 with the HD600/650/800. A rectifier upgrade is a must, you can postpone the driver tube upgrade for later. Admittedly that doesn't leave much budget for the DAC but the WA6 is much better sounding than the likes of O2 or Magni.
For what you want I would recommend the 650's over the 600's, but that just my choice. The Audio Technica ATH-AD700 are highly recommended for gaming.

>bass heavyhahahahahahahahahaha.I gave mine away because they were not bass heavy at all. 4 years and the fuckers never punched harder than my Sony extra bass headphones.
he said "a little base heavy", not nigger bass, shitty ears.
at first glance the HD650s seem much higher quality.
Honestly, It's about how much Phillips gave a shit improving them over the x1's. They have great bass and imaging which will help with gaming. >Also would you recommend them over the HD650s?That's a tough call. There really isn't a wrong answer. If you feel more comfortable with the HD650's, I say go for it. Sennheiser is a great brand, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
>punchfor "punchier" bass i'd go with DT880, for a general warmer signature the HD650.
It's a warm tilted headphone with a surprising amount of bass for an open backed headphone.Monitor tier flatness in headphones is rare, and that price range might be generally more colored than the cheaper gear. Maybe the HE-560, but its definitely bright leaning.>I have no one else to talk to about IEMs

I remember I downloaded the equalizer epo thing someone had setup specifically for their mdr v6s to reduce sibilance I'd love to do that again.
As anyone ever gone back to an old headphone and really enjoyed it after getting an upgrade?Since the new pads arrived i'm having so much fun with my MDR v6, no wonder i liked it so much first time i listened to it.
ok, jokes aside, it's ok not to like a headphone Anon, but be aware that the portapro actualy is a respected headphone in it's price range and has been recommended here for many years, even before the first /hpg/.
Now I see all these equalizer posts. Does it make your cans work better then what they already are? If so how can I do this.Pic related cans I have
Way better. Look up your headphone's frequency response and tame them to get a more neutral sound.
For example, this is a graph of the Grado SR325. Their good headphones, but their bright as shit. So you need to tame the treble. This site may help you. http://www.headphone.com/pages/build-a-graph
cute yoshi :3
Your talking to a guy who knows  only if it sounds good or like shit. Where would one find this info/equalize it at
http://www.headphone.com/pages/evaluating-headphones
I would think it it easier to work with a VST with a nice GUI when hammering out the EQ, and then transposing the results to the EQ APO, with or without PEACE.>Does it make your cans work better then what they already are?It absolutely can, if you perform it properly. Measurements can help with the broad strokes, but they don't have the precision for fine tuning and they don't have your exact pair or your ears.Even more if the graphs are smoothed, such as all the graphs from Goldenears, and measurements not made from Headroom's compensated response.As an example of smoothing effects, the same 325 without smoothing. You should ignore everything above 10kHz.You need to figure out what you want as a target.For guides, there are two guides at head-fi, but I remember some problems with both.Guide #1:www.head-fi.org/a/how-to-equalize-your-headphones-a-tutorialGuide #2:www.head-fi.org/t/615417/how-to-equalize-your-headphones-advanced-tutorial-in-progress
>I have no one else to talk to about IEMsI know right. I don't know why they are not popular around here when their performance level is much higher than full circumaural headphones.
I saved the pic because I currently am looking for headphones. It'll take me more to get porta pro's again.I really didn't hate them, but was very disappointed in my personal experience how others praised them.I want the V6 headphones, but I might get the professionals instead.
I've always been itching to try one, but my brain can't fathom how the would be better than headphones. So I'm always too scared to spend the cash.
The ones with memory foam tips felt much better than the rubber ones that force my ears open like a dildo.JVC Marshmallow earbuds was a good pair around $20. Koss Sparkplugs were great as well.Also.... I am another person, not him.
/hpg/ what about the Oppo PM-3? Has anyone heard them? What are they like compared to the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 (wired)?
I've yet to find a full-size that sounds as neutral as my ER-4PT.
That guide is very old anon, prices are way off, the AD700 for example is not even produced anymore.Anyway, the v6 and the 7506 are practically the same headphone, Sony just changed a few materials, slaped a new sticker on it and called the day, go with the cheapest one, besides, the V6 is professional too, it's been considered instustry standard for 30 years now.
Portability, of course.Many IEMs have isolation far exceeding sealed headphones.Some people also want the soundscape to be even more in the head. Weird.Accurate tuned IEMs are more suited for binaural and ambisonic type playback, since they are subject to little acoustic variation besides insertion depth.Circumaurals have much more variation as they are moved around the head.The neutral IEMs are more neutral than the neutral headphones, but EQ can clean this up either way.
what are some good pads to get for my ad700s?mine are kind of worn down a bit even after cleaning with tape/lint rollersor should I just get some of these gaymen headsets?
Do any of them they need to be driven?
Whats a tough looking cable for the hd600? Currently using the HD650 cable as the standard 600 cable is fucking garbage tier and broke after 2 months of use, I'm after something shorter as the current cable is ridiculously long.
Can you give me an advice on a good entry-level custom IEM for a newbie?
The requirements for IEMs are a bit different from headphones. Low noise should be obvious, and the need for a lower output impedance is more important, since some IEMs have very lopsided impedance plots from the crossovers used.Besides the Etykids, I don't know anything else with hard driving requirements. Being a voltage hog was a deliberate design in the in the Etykids though, as an SPL limiter.>inb4 Fitear 000 IEM cableHD 25 steel cable? It's not cheap, like all the other replacement Sennheiser parts.
>$200 and over headphones:>http://a.pomf.se/lncogq.pngCan this be updated to show whether or not the headphone is worth the price.the DT880 description sounds as if they are better than the LCD-XC.
Did they just increase the price of the HD 800?The list is there because it was voted there.I thought the XC really sucked, and its not even in the same category.
I'll recommend what I bought when I was looking for some IEMs. Look at the SE215's, they're perfect for on the go and the isolation is superb. Not sure about edm and rock, but listening to metal on them sounds great.

M50's really aren't that bad if you enjoy a bassy sound signature. For the full price the m50x's are bad though. Around 100 and you're doing ok. They are uncomfortable as hell though.
i-i like y-you too...
I don't like you anymore, fuck off with your stuttering meme shit.
Ehh I got an LP2 and I think it's miles ahead of my HD 598 (who's only advantage is the cans clamp on significantly less, it's fabric pads feel softer especially after haircuts, lighter weight overall and I have to use EQ through my iPod to keep the highs from becoming too shrilly and giving me tinnitus).In ear monitors if your ears can handle them and you can maintain both your ears and the buds clean. Otherwise I would point you towards cans that emphasize on clean lows and mids especially given the music you prefer.

AD900X for best soundstage in it's price rangeHD558 for a warmer signature(HD598 and 558 are the same, you just need to remove a smal piece of foam from the HD558)
I think I recall the brainwavz pads fitting on them
Yes, I did too, I don't know why they make the connection end on the unit too small for the plug. It only makes sense you would plug it all the way in, right? Anyway, I sent it back and they repaired for free (just had to pay shipping). Oh, they also pointed out that I should have known the plug only needed to go halfway in, so next time JDS labs for me.
As a follow up to this, a mildly interesting product aimed at the Etymotics, the Wavelet Design Opus 1. Looks like a warmer tuned ER-4P with flatter bass, without the deep penetration. Maybe a bit too warm, but nothing some ER4S adapters won't fix.On a related note, why do all the measurements seem to be pouring out of South Korea?Their tuning seemed off for most of the models.
Are there any IEMs around the same SQ as my DT 880 (or better?) at a reasonable price, say sub $100?
Thanks, will look into it.
A quick google search shows they do. From my experience the velour pads are extremely comfortable but they probably wouldn't be the best choice for the kind of headphone ATH-M50 are

>Why not sell off one of the closed headphones?I still use the ATH-M50s because they're nice portable headphones. They're good for short sessions like when I'm walking to class and whatnot.

There's a marketplace seller on Amazon who can ship the AD900X to NZ for about $217nzd all up, I can't say if the 500 or 700 would be an upgrade or sidegrade from the HM5 clones though but you could get those for even less.

Nothing on this end. I would say the most uncommon or unusual watch I own is my Agat stopwatch with the 11-jewel movement.

Actually no, i have never serviced this clock, there's a gear that is missing a dent but it has been like that since 2006, thanks to a fucking idiot at a pawn shop. Still working normally tho.

Watches will mainly be known as a fashion accessory. These watches are all dweeby as shit.
Uninspired but I think it's classic enough to own.
My Heritage Ranger really isn't anything too interesting horologically, but the lume on the dial is hand painted, which is pretty cool. Its also keeping time extremely well. I set it exactly last week Monday, and by Friday it was about 2.5 seconds ahead. I wore it a lot less on the weekend, so I lost a few seconds, but as of right now its about 0.25 seconds behind. Hopefully it'll gain back some time during the week.
6139 bullhead with vader colors? In good condition? You're looking at like 700-1000.Could get a 6138-3000. Can find in good condition 400 ish.
this one is at 391 right now, ends in 10 hours.Follow your dreams anon.>http://www.ebay.com/itm/Seiko-6138-0040-Bullhead-Automatic-Chronograph-/181753118204?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_15&hash=item2a51547dfcBut in all honesty the speedmaster would probably be the better option because you can actually find parts easily and people still know how to service them. It can be hard to source parts for old Seiko movements.If you want a bullhead chrono you could get a vintage citizen. Very similar movement and seize.They're going for like 230-250
OK,  why the fuck do you always post the same ugly shit watches,  seriously 80% of the watches posted in this thread look like pure shit. Divers, cheap russian watches,  old seiko 5s that looked like they were in india's fucking shit river and all the shitty cloth straps scream autism. God even the apple fags have better taste.
Why are you upset?
>God even the apple fags have better tasteThem's fightin' words
I love your watch, i open up the image everytime you post it. Wanted to get one but can't find 'em here in Brazil.Was thinking about getting this https://www.enjoei.com.br/p/seiko-1544045?product_id=1544045&qid=nkx8wii6ama2wdkomwyuwa&ref=1&sref=search but guess i decided to get a tattoo and keep my Weekender instead.Maybe i'll get it on my birthday if it's still available (Probably will be since most people don't even know Seiko around here and just buy whatever the shit they found like Invictas and fashion brand watches)
Hey watchmakeranon, how easy is to get a watch running that good? I have a cheap Kenneth Cole (yeah fashion shit but it was a gift) with a Seagull ST1601K2 mov, with a delta of about 4.5s. I had it regulated by a local watchmaker but the guy just brought it down from the horrible +30s/d to about 15s/d, probably beacuse he just did a shitty rush job on it.
Thanks, I saw one in one of these threads once and went on an endless search to find one. Fortunately for me however, most ebayers ship to burgerland
Buy an 8926OB and appeal to everyone
Costs 300$ here and i'd rather cut my wrists out to never wear one of those
import it for 80 from the EU and you have a weekender glass houses + stones.
If its already has a good delta and the average rate just needs to be brought down, then it should be about a 5 minute job. I can't really see why he wouldn't have done better than only bringing it down to +15s/d.

>mfw anon's watch already arrived and someone else is just posting this epic maymay everyday
Star Citizen general on /vg/, that weebum gets posted a lot because the guy looks like Chris Roberts.
Oh. I actually pre-ordered that game and have no idea where they are in development. I'm pretty sure I got the webm on /an/. I just figured it would be good because -- you know -- anon probably ordered dog shit.
i have ordered and received two watches and this dumbass still keeps posting this gif
i wouldn't mind that as a work watch, seems like they don't make a 36mm datejust with a black dial anymore so i've got to go vintage or pre-used instead of just walking into an AD. wtf, rolex?

shit, i was on the site the other day on my phone and didn't see that one. white gold though, eh?
Fluted bezel only comes in white gold as far as I know.
yeah, i was probably conflating it in my mind with with the air king. i should go and try one of those to see if 34mm is too small. maybe just get a 38.5mm aqua terra and hibernate on watches for a couple of years.
Might as well, at least while there's still some untouched (if that's what you're looking for) Air Kings still around.
Constant vigilance /g on pre-order watch.
Fuck your Obris Morgan. I'm waiting for the Delfin to come back.
They said they'll email me once it's available.
i ordered their "homage" isofrane and god damn it's taking forever to arrive
What did he order?I kind of half-expected it to be a pink G-Shock with Akari's face printed on the dial.
I just got my HMT in the mail, I ordered it a month ago. I have been wearing Seiko 5 Sports. I like the sound of the tick of the HMT, and the feeling of handwinding it.Does it look small on my wrist?
A shitty Zeppelin
Looks like it fits quite well to me.The lugs don't /have/ to be half a millimeter from being overhanging you know..
Anyone got experience with any good authorized dealer for omega in the Toronto area?
speaking of half a millimeter from overhanging, got my gw8900 today. holy shit this thing is large.
post your pleb tier vintage watch collections
>gw 8900My brotha
Those look nice. Which one is your favorite?
that's a tough question.  I probably wear the seiko the most, because it is the most reliable, but I really love the UG for the history behind it (and it's the nicest of them all by far.)
i feel like a 13-year-old who stole his older brother's watch
I like everything about that accutron

yeah, i kind of feel like a jackass. i'm going to wear this to work to lower expectations even further.
it looks worse in person, note the flaking paint around the dial and the scratches in the crystal.  although it looks great from a few feet away.  It looks way better with a black band and the gasket is wrong, so if I tighten the back it interferes with the regulator.
are those fucking T20s?
>Seiko Datejust HomageMy life is complete, details on the model number?
5y23-8a69
>My life is completebut... that doesn't have a stylized wang on the dial
You're doing it wrong if you don't get a king quartz with a double quartz movement (double-wang icon)

okay, shitty picture with my potatophone, but i'm actually really liking my other watch that brown santa brought me. >no wang but it's a donger

why is linux such an epic failure? It has less than 1% marketshare on x86/x86_64 systems, and even its popular mobile platforms (webos and android) have become shitpiles. Just look and how webos turned out for hp, and how android is just an iOS rip off, and in order to get any of the functionality users tout that it has over iOS you must root it, giving you all the exact same 'functionality' as a rooted iOS. There must be a reason for all of this.

Daily reminder that there are more than a few similarities between Linux and a typicalreligious cult.For example:✓ Both worship their leader.✓ Both have a distended, warped view of their subject matter.✓ Both are obsessed with something that most people know nothing about.✓ Both believe that they are right and everyone else is wrong.✓ Both insist on proselytizing or converting every single person into the fold.✓ Both have a warped view of the economy. IOW give everything away for free.✓ Both have socialistic tendencies.✓ Both seem to attract oddballs, social misfits and the mentally ill.✓ Both encourage obsessive behavior and total devotion to the cause.✓ Both disparage and try to discredit the mainstream or competition.✓ Both have a militaristic attitude of you are either with us 100 percent or against us....and so it goes.It sure seems like Linux is a cult.
Congratulations, you LITERALLY just fell for Windows propaganda and made a thread about it.
Are you saying that this linux can run on a computer without windows underneath it, at all ? As in, without a boot disk, without any drivers, and without any services ?That sounds preposterous to me.If it were true (and I doubt it), then companies would be selling computers without a windows. This clearly is not happening, so there must be some error in your calculations. I hope you realise that windows is more than just Office ? Its a whole system that runs the computer from start to finish, and that is a very difficult thing to acheive. A lot of people dont realise this.Microsoft just spent $9 billion and many years to create Vista, so it does not sound reasonable that some new alternative could just snap into existence overnight like that. It would take billions of dollars and a massive effort to achieve. IBM tried, and spent a huge amount of money developing OS/2 but could never keep up with Windows. Apple tried to create their own system for years, but finally gave up recently and moved to Intel and Microsoft.Its just not possible that a freeware like the Linux could be extended to the point where it runs the entire computer from start to finish, without using some of the more critical parts of windows. Not possible.I think you need to re-examine your assumptions.
Windows installs in about 5 mins for me and all my devices work.

Free software is NOT better than proprietary software. This is just a simple fact. Emacs sucks. Gimp blows a wad compared to Photoshop.Yes they're free. But the time you waste fumbling around with the terrible UI and lack of features costs way more than the price of the paid software, which is usually way better.Sorry Linux fags. Yes, maybe you can make a decent free OS because the best OSes just stay the fuck outta the way. But just leave the software to the professionals.Pic related - it took like 10 minutes in Gimp, when it would have take 45 seconds in Photoshop.
>All drivers are preinstalled, graphics, sound, network, all working flawlesslyif you have the proper hardware. but god beware you don't. ever tried to use a laptop with optimus? ever had sound problems in linux? this is where the real fun starts. also about the wacom: tried to use it once with an out of the box install and krita (art program). every time i would try to actually do anything with the tablet the whole screen would freeze for 10s and everything would horribly lag. so much for out-of-the-box perfect bullshit.
>Both worship their leader.What leader?>Both are obsessed with something that most people know nothing about.Perfectly normal. I'm a tech nerd. Of course I like tech. Are golfers also obsessed with something most people know nothing about?>Both believe that they are right and everyone else is wrong.You think your beliefs are true, by definition. That implies you believe other people are wrong. EVERYONE believes they are right and everyone else is wrong. Anything else is a logical impossibility.>Both insist on proselytizing or converting every single person into the fold.Because both groups think it will benefit the people being converted. Some Linux users also think giving money to Microsoft or Apple is harmful to the industry.>Both have a warped view of the economy. IOW give everything away for free.Nope! It is perfectly fine to redistribute free software, and you can sell support or binaries.The rest is just obviously wrong.Every single point there applies only to some Linux users, hardly all of them. It's also nonsense, because having superficial similarities to a cult doesn't make something a cult. Or are you just like Hitler because both you and Hitler have hair?

Installing with a package manager is faster, anon.And installing drivers is so shit, only graphics drivers should be installed. It's funny because a Linux distro have around 1 GB and supports almost every hardware, while Windows is >3GB and still needs drivers.

Well luckily my grandparents never learned how to use windows. They only use one application (which also is available on linux) and the only difference is that the theme is different and the system is responsive. They barely use it anyway but I still think I saved that computer. If it wasn't for linux they would have bought a new laptop and since they hardly use one that would be silly.

Ya know if you could look passed all the closed source and security flaws and just accepted that your paying someone to do it for you windows wouldn't be that bad, but the fact is that its still terrible and actively made more insecure without any real tangible difference between versions. If I'm gonna pay for something I expect it to at least be worth the money and function, and if it breaks I expect to be able to actually fix it, not just twiddle my thumbs and wait for some bullshit from microsoft. They get away with selling bullshit because its OEM, most people don't look beyond the advertisements, and "worse is better"

Best processor Processor for a super gaming computer? help :(
8806.  You won't find anything better.  It's a pussy slayer.

4690k is really all that you need, its actually objectively the best processor for gaming, gaming doesnt benefit from hyperthreading so an i5 should be enough for you. if you have any other questions i would be glad to help
Yes. 4690k is currently the best on the market. For a gayming GPU, I recommend an R9 290X if you have no heating in your house and a Titan X if you can afford it. 970 is good too, just don't mind the AMD shills.
That might be the most condensed form of shit posting I have ever seen.  With the answers above and this post this whole thread can be considered complete
anything with lots of cores, DX12 and the like will greatly benefit from it.
hes not actually wrong, guy who recommended 4690k here, i have two 290x in crossfire and honestly they dont really run that hot even though i got the low recommended 290xs (asus direct cu2 model) and i never see temps above 70c so he was meme posting there but honestly the 970 meme card isnt that bad considering you arent gayming above 1080p. i would still revommend the 290x any day over the 970 though.
I'll make sure to just put '/thread' next time, Anon. Just to please your autism.
dx12 will make hyperthreading usefulanything under 4790k is a waste of money
What do you expect from /g/? Meme posting is half the content.

How does one go about learning to program?
Read a book on it
K&R C, 2nd edition.The best book for 30 years. Still 100% up-to-date.
Read some code, write some code, repeat.
http://althing.cs.dartmouth.edu/local/x86-doc.pdf
It depends on what you want to make.Generally, you'll just have to Google up some online tutorials. I wouldn't recommend learning from a book because they usually go over basic things you can find online for free.

Unlambda?
Working my way through HtdP 2e and Realm of Racket. Going to make an incremental game when I'm finished. Been a mildly enjoyable experience so far.
Does anyone have a practical example of good, idiomatic macro usage?
a bad ideahttp://www.madore.org/~david/programs/unlambda/
Been using Clojure for a few weeks now, and I have to say I really like it.I've dabbled in Scheme and Racket, so at first clojure syntax seemed more complicated, but now it seems as good as any other lisp.Looking forward to go through HtdP as soon as I finish my finals, will probably check out lfe / erlang / elixir after that
I was planning on taking a look at elixir as well. It's homoiconicity + erlang libraries/vm interest me coming from a primarily JVM background.
For Erlang-like actors in Clojure, there's Pulsar which is still under active development.https://github.com/puniverse/pulsarThe docs look thorough, too.http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/pulsar/
hmm that looks interesting, what would be the main difference between pulsar and core.async?
Is HtDP a good book for learning Scheme, and then progressing to more advanced books?Would it instead be better to read "teach yourself scheme in fixnum days"?Would it be better to jump directly to SICP?
Code written for Pulsar can run on a cluster of machines.From the docs:> Pulsar is able to run on a cluster, thereby letting actors and channels communicate across machines. The Pulsar/Quasar cluster runs on top of Galaxy, Parallel Universe’s in-memory data grid.
Another interesting take on clustering the Clojure people is Onyx:http://michaeldrogalis.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/01/20/Onyx-0.5.0:-The-Cluster-as-a-Value.htmlhttps://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx
I liked these guidelines.http://www.lispcast.com/when-to-use-a-macro> Summary: Macros should be avoided to the extent possible. There are three circumstances where they are required.> 1. The code has to run at compile time> 2. You need access to unevaled arguments> 3. You need to emit inline code
Yeah I skimmed the onyx docs a few days ago and it looked interesting, I guess I'll try pulsar, onyx and core.async when I have some free time and see how they fare against each other.
I got SICP out of my college library and got through the first three chapters without much problem, although I didn't solve most of the exercises.I then skimmed through The Little Schemer but didn't like the style that much, did a few weeks of the HtDP course over at coursera ( https://www.coursera.org/course/programdesign , it's over now, but you can still enroll and watch all the videos)
Most of the macros I find myself writing are for declaring new operators in order to simplify repeated code. So for example say you have the following(def a {:foo x :bar y :baz z})(- a (apply-if-present f :foo) (apply-if-present g :bar) (apply-if-present h :baz))I'll go ahead and do(>?= a (f :foo) (g :bar) (h :baz))where you define >?= as(defmacro >?= [val & fns]  (let [fns (for [f fns] `(apply-if-present ~(first f) ~(second f)))]    `(- ~val          ~@fns)))
That was interesting to read.  I wasn't aware that macros were gimped in Clojure.Do you have any recommendations for Common Lisp macro guidelines?  The eval-when special form negates the first guideline.  The second is still valid.  The third is only valid if you don't use an implementation that follows declarations or need a guarantee of inlining.
>I wasn't aware that macros were gimped in Clojure.Glanced over it the article. In what way are they gimped? If you mean "macros are not first class" (macros are first class, sort of, they just don't exist at run time) then that's true of every Lisp's macros that I've heard of. In fact, that's necessary in order for them to be macros.
I made a mistake.  SBCL lets you access macro objects at runtime, but that's not standard behavior.
I noticed that he mentions> Another example is performing expensive calculations at compile time as an optimizationWhat would you win over just using a future?
>futureThe future still happens at runtime.  Sure, you can schedule the future so that it's calculating the value in the background before you need it, but it's still happening while you run your program rather than before.
The biggest disadvantage I can see from using macros as a way to do expensive computations is that they only happen at compile time, so you are stuck with whatever value it yielded the first time, right?In the linked article, he uses it as a way to get the actual date, but by defining it inside a macro, you are stuck with whatever date you are when you compile the program, and any future call to your program will use whatever date you were when you first compiled your program.Am I reading that totally wrong?
>so you are stuck with whatever value it yielded the first time, rightPretty much.  I agree that this particular technique is prone to all the problems you mentioned, and I don't think I'd ever use macros in this way.The cons outweigh the pros in this case.
Here's some history on why Clojure doesn't do reader macros.http://briancarper.net/blog/449/clojure-reader-macroshttp://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2008-11-06.html#19:29d> Clojure doesn't allow user-defined reader macros because they can't be combined - there's no namespace support, unlike for regular macros http://www.infoq.com/interviews/hickey-clojure-reader
http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2008-11-06.html#19:38a> rhickey: AWizzArd: CL has user reader macros and the consensus is to avoid them
>Clojure doesn't allow user-defined reader macros because they can't be combined - there's no namespace support, unlike for regular macrosThat seems reasonable, but I think Racket's reader modification system actually relies upon namespaces.
If that's true, hopefully Clojure can pick up a few more tricks from Racket.One of the strongest contemporary arguments for adding reader macros to Clojure is to make using Typed Clojure less of a pain to use.
I just found a library that implements reader macros for Clojure.https://github.com/one-more-minute/chiara
I don't personally share the author's viewpoint. Parentheses make for a readable language in my experience. I think that I learned Lisp early on in programming helps too. People should approach the language with a beginner's mindset thoroughly.
a couple of emacs tricks I found:In Scheme it is idiomatic to use lambda a lot in function definitions, so if you get tired of seeing lambda everywhere, you can replace it with the greek lambda symbol. So when you type lambda, it will automatically convert to the greek symbol when you finish typing(defun sm-greek-lambda ()       (font-lock-add-keywords nil `(("\\<lambda\\>"           (0 (progn (compose-region (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)           ,(make-char 'greek-iso8859-7 107))           nil))))))(add-hook 'XXX-mode-hook 'sm-greek-lambda)replace XXX with whatever lisp mode you use, like I use scheme-mode, or it could be lisp-mode for cl, or clojure-mode, whatever.Also when you go into lisp mode or schem mode by opening a .scm or .lisp file respectively, you have an option to start up a scheme or lisp interpreter. You will see lisp or scheme in the drop down menu (if you did not get rid of the dropdown menu in your configuration). In the menu of these minor modes there is an option to start up an interpreter, emacs will look for 'scheme' or 'lisp' in your path. Most likely your scheme or lisp implementation doesnt start with the 'lisp' or 'scheme' command which means renaming it with a symlink. I suggest putting a file in your path named lisp or scheme so you can start up your lisp quietly like this/usr/bin/clisp -q and chmoding it so its executable
In my custom lisp implementation I just rewrote a naive "append" in terms of quasiquote+unquote-splicing and it's 100x faster. Big difference between primitive functions and normal library functions at the moment.
Yeah, I was more interested in the reader macro library he came up with.
Yea, It's surprisingly simple. Everyone made the syntax sound spooky and bad, but it was really intuitive for me. Maybe that's because I'm not some java codemonkey and I'm learning it for my own enjoyment so i haven't had the shitty principles of other languages drilled into me.
alternatively you could use pretty-mode from MELPA which does unicode for a lot of things from lambda to logic gates. Just install it then drop this into your .emacs:(require 'pretty-mode)(global-pretty-mode t)
pretty-mode is deprecated as emacs comes with prettify-symbols-mode built in to emacs 24, however you manually have to activate it with M-x prettify-symbols-mode everytime you want to replace text with symbols where as my .emacs script will do auto-replace as you are typing
Ah I hadn't realized that. Still couldn't you just use mode hooks to add entries to the prettify-symbols alist like so:  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook            (lambda ()              (push '(">=" . ?≥) prettify-symbols-alist)))
yes, but as I said, you constantly have to enterM-x prettify-symbols-mode to do the text/symbol swap with prettify-symbols-mode whereas my elisp code auto-replaces as you type
Oh god that's awful. Thanks for explaining, anon!
Actually I checked this on my end and that's not the case. You may have to enable the mode each time, but the symbols update as you type them as in your elisp. And with the global mode you negate the issue of having to enable the mode in each buffer as well.
Is there anyway to run flycheck only on variable/function names in emacs?I know this is broad/etc, but emacs can already parse most languages enough to correctly color variables....
flyspell* I mean, not flycheck.
Yeah, but you'd need to gut out the lexer that your syntax highlighter is using.
Alright, so I guess nothing of the sort exists?
I doubt it, sorry, at least not for languages in general. It's very possible though. Some compilers have this built in for unbound variables (e.g., Haskell's GHC. After you get past their length, GHC's error messages are second to none for usefulness). There's also the problem of creating a spellchecker for variables. GHC's messages compare with bound variables for similarity, but for spellchecking in general you'd need to accept things like aVariable. This seems like a somewhat difficult algorithm unless you can find material that discusses the problem as is. For Lisps it'd be easier-- just count -s as spaces, add in some extra words like cdr and you're more or less set.
I was thinking that could be gotten around by treating capitalization changes as spaces, so it'd see aVariable as a Variable.Add in -s for spaces as you said to handle snake case, and the only problem is abbreviations.Oh well.You wouldn't happen to know if something like this exists for any language, not languages in general, would you?
>You wouldn't happen to know if something like this exists for any language, not languages in general, would you?I've never heard of it to be honest. It seems doable.
Yeah, and it'd be handy I feel.Would just need an easy way to add abbreviations to the dictionary.
Any way of making a lisp version of 4chanx? At the very least a lisp to javascript or something.
parenscript should workhttps://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/tutorial.html

Do you have the willpower to maintain such a project for multiple years?
4chan probably only has a few years left anyway.
Yes
4chan might outlive us all.
ClojureScript. OrWhaleSong (for Racket)
>At the very least a lisp to javascript or something.That's already been done a few times.
But real question were any of them good.
Clojurescript is pretty much your best bet, it is actively maintained and the community is bigger than any other lisp->javascript that I know of (whalesong being the other one).It also has pretty good tooling:http://lighttable.com/ (text editor written in clojurescript)https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen (clojure build tool)https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel (leiningen plugin for real-time browser updates as you change your code)
>X to javascriptWhy do people insist on doing this?  You're going to have to debug the code in Javascript anyway.
Some people dislike JavaScript that much. Also, it's a way for languages to gain more relevance/market-share, because if you can target js, you can reach a lot of people.
Until someone makes a browser that supports any other programming language, we are pretty much stuck with javascript for the client-side.The only option we have right now is to compile to javascript.One can only hope one day we can choose what language to use "natively" in the browser
You have to get multiple browser vendors to agree, too. Not happening any time soon if ever.
There's also the possibility of a plugin, as in Flashplayer or Java.You could probably package racket, guile, or clozurecl in one along with some extensions to operate as JS does.Though it isn't a lisp, an interesting alternative might be Elm.
this could be a thing I guess, but we already know how flash and java ended up
Plugins aren't really an option for mobile browsers.
We could also use a browser written in Lisp.

Browsers will probably fall out of use eventually and people will be expected to use a delivery system to download the proper utility to do whatever they were going to do online.I hope it happens like this.  Browsers have become complicated and annoying.  I don't browse a large variety of sites.  Most that I browse would work with a simple browser, like links2.That's a neat nickname.  I'm reminded of Shenturians.
>WhaleSong (for Racket)You know, I never knew that existed until today.
Hello /lisp/, what do you use for GUIs on Common Lisp? Primarily interested in just playing with it on OS X but ideally something Lispy, cross platform, and at least resembling native. Is the browser really the best option?
Browser will never look native.

Functionally, what's the difference between let and local definitions in racket?
Same as in Scheme.(let ((x 0) (y 1)) (+ x y))==((lambda (x y) (+ x y)) 0 1)Unlike local definitions, let bindings can't be recursive (though letrecs can) and can't refer to each other (though let*s, if the bindings are given in order, can). Define also allows for an easier function definition. The vast majority of the time there's no reason not to use local definitions, and it's preferred by Racket style too.

Everything in favor of linux over BSD is what people used to say about windows over linux... OS wars will never end and arguments only slightly change.
When you say "shill", I can't really say the thinkpad has been because it is a legitimate product for a certain task, which is for business.  It looks like shit - it's supposed to, it's meant to be replaceable and have panels everywhere and not be pretty, it's all about time to replace failed parts which is rare to start with, but the attitude isn't "le buy it again".  also even if you still consider this shilling, most of the new models aren't even recommended so it defeats the "shill" shit anyway.in recent memory the thing that was shilled the most was elementary OS, there were tons of wannabe threads posted daily that felt as if they were written by someone who was only here for a week and was trying too hard to fit in.  after it was launched or out of beta those threads dropped off.I would say apple but due to the old meme of each 4chan board being a joke on itself, there are too many trolls that ironically post apple shit because they enjoy flaming people and pretending to be someone elsethe other thing I can remember is BSD and other obscure oses like haiku and plan9.  However those again aren't really shills, it's more of a psuedo religion and a form of extreme hipsterism to enable hippies to have more chances to pretend to be better than everyone else.  They are presented like shill threads ("Why don't you use BSD?  The GPL is cancer") but at the end any serious possible converts end up in condescending responses ("Well, you probably just wouldn't understand a pure unix way, or some other shit, I suck cocks")
there's a never not a thinkpad thread on /g/.

They aren't even remotely comparable though, the BSD kernel, userland, and toolchain are all less capable and  permissively licensed.The entire point of switching from Windows to Linux is to gain software freedom, there is no reason to downgrade to BSD and permissive licenses when there is no benefit.

Actually, most T61p have a GPU which will die even if the cooling is good. That is independent from the temperature.

Been using my Asus k43ta since 2011. Plays gamez too.
The divine keyboards are the sole reason I buy them. No other manufacturer comes close
To be fair, 3 screens is legitimately useful for multitasking. But I only ever use 3 screens when I'm at work; at home, most of the time it's the good ol' shitty 1280x800 Latitude E6500 and accompanying 1280x1024 IBM ThinkVision monitor. I don't really care about the missing vertical pixels on the laptop since I've got more vertical space on my 9-year-old monitor than most people have on their brand new 1080p models. And I prefer the larger text and better visibility you get from the lower-resolution monitors; these new tiny, high-res displays are tough on the eyes.The X-series usually has 1366x768 screens, but that is fine with most people since they tend to only be 12" or so. As I said, ludicrously high resolutions on tiny screens is... questionable.I find Lenovo batteries wear out quickly. My work-issued T520 (with the 1366x768 screen, truly suffering) has completely lost its charge after only about 3 years of use, whereas my aforementioned Latitude is still fine after 6 years.
>he didn't do research on a product before buying it>on the words of anonymous strangers on the internet, no less>and he bought the first one he saw instead of looking around for better dealsNow whose fault is that?I got a T60 because I wanted a cheap-ass laptop I could learn programming on and generally fuck around with. It werks fine for that. If you got a model that old and expected to use it as a primary laptop, I dunno what you were thinking.

Do you really think people are getting paid to post about linux?  C'mon.
Here's what the fuck I don't get about shilling:What the fuck are the companies trying to get out of it? If they make baseless claims, then their posts are bullshit whether they're paid for or not.If they provide objective evidence for their product's superiority, then it's the best product either way.
Microsoft Windows. Nothing else comes close.It's not the companies shilling it. It's users who feel insecure because they know it's shit, but they have to use it because that's where the video games are. So, they lash out at better options with a load of bullshit memes.
Even in this thread, all the "Linux" responses, like Linux is being shilled at all (or is even capable of being shilled). Any time Linux is mentioned on /g/, people who are stuck with Windows for video game reasons attack it relentlessly until the thread goes away.
Zenfone is obviously being shilled hard. I can't even take it serious anymore even if it's a legitimate review.
>It's not the companies shilling it.I think you're missing the point of this thread. Do you even understand what the word “shill” means?Something is shilling if the company themselves is paying somebody to write positive statements about it.If nobody is getting paid to write the posts, then it's LITERALLY not shilling. By the definition of the word itself.This thread is about actual shilling - ie. which companies actually, legitimately pay people to get on /g/ and post about their products.So no, somebody defending Windows because they're insecure does not count as “shilling”.
>Windows 10>WP>Visual StudioFucking Microsoft fags, I tell you.
that and the IBM model m
By the correct definition  nothing is shilled here. No company gives a fuck about paid advertising on a basement-dweller forum like this.Complete shit products which faggots spruik however:WindowsnVidiaAppleAMD CPUsGentoo (everyone really runs Arch/Debian/Ubuntu)
I'm sure that I've seen actual developers shill their products at *least* once on /g/, in particular some of the kickstarter projects that have been posted here gives me that impression.I think the most obvious example was that motorized skateboard kickstarter thing - it's obvious not only because this is exactly the type of neckbeard community that would never give a shit about it, but also because there was somebody consistently posting statements that sounded like badly written advertising into the thread.
Also, I run Gentoo, and I know plenty of others (both on /g/ and off /g/) who do. I think it's the best Linux distribution currently available.
I have a GTX 570 (1250MB), should I get another one and put it into SLI or just buy a slightly better new card?
Was thinking maybe an R9 290.
Or whatever 300 series card is in the same price bracket.
570s are pointless now, the 1.25GB of ram is so low putting 2 into the same computer would have next to no effect. Just get a 290.
I second this. I have a GTX 570 too, just get a new one.
So what has, or is happening with this?
Got pressured by the NSA into ceasing development.You can still use it if you really want to, but beware that it's no longer receiving security updates so it's basically a ticking time bomb until somebody discovers a vulnerability that won't get patched.As an alternative, I suggest using Linux's cryptosystem, together with dm-crypt / LUKS in order to perform full-disk encryption.
last audit found (after the bullshit) truecrypt to still be safe. However, if you're the paranoid type 7.1a still works and there's always the veracrypt fork.
So the audit is NSA propaganda?
Install GNU/Linux and use its full disk encryption, and virtualize Windows with VT-D.
I don't know, but I don't think that's true.The NSA forcing them into ceasing development is a pretty good sign that it was secure at the time they did so. (If it was insecure or backdoor'd, do you really think they would want people to STOP using Truecrypt?)So if anything, I think the opposite is true and the NSA was legitimately concerned about the level of ease with which it provided people a means to encrypt their shit securely.Again, the problem is only once somebody finds a vulnerability that won't get fixed. There's no knowing when that will happen, or if it has happened already.

I'm staying the hell away from that discussion.
Its not like we expect that rookie site to have any invite threads.

for real though, I only joined yesterday but I'm liking it so far (and will probably recruit there in the future, when we get our own shit sorted out)

Ask staff before uploadingAww shiiit I fucking love this tracker
That spaghetti or whatever will just shit out warns because people disagree with his shitty opinion
>making a thread about private trackers>unironically garnering attention toward said trackers>being this fucking stupid
I joined it as well. It's software could be the future of trackers. Sadly, it doesn't actually have the TV I wanted to download (Miami Vice)
Good, all these archive fags will go the fuck away.
Yes oh god what if you get warned? Then what will you do? You won't be able to ascend the useless user classes for a whole number of days and uh, nothing else.
but I don't want to download music, I WANT RARE FILMS BREH. If I make a what account I have to download stuff and upload or keep a good seed ratio, then ask around for a KG invite.ugh, such a hassle to get invited there.
Nigga i've been seeing you post that pic on /tv/ since like december kek
It is a universal sign that the staff thinks your post is against the rules. By doing that the retard makes clear he does not care about them and will bend it as he pleases. What if someone keeps posting? Will he be banned?
dude, what the fuck. I've been trying to join that site for the longest. Hook me up bruh!
Then do somehting else. No one will spoonfeed you.
true.Does KG host interviews?
Fight the bourgeoisie sysop regime Anons.
>It is a universal sign that the staff thinks your post is against the rulesNot on Oppaitime. We just call you names here and ruffle your feathers a bit. It ain't reddit where we're gonna ban dissenting opinions, but we're also not "no fun allowed".And (unrelated) we will totally ban untasteful shitposting. Don't try that under the guise of an opinion.>What if someone keeps posting? Will he be banned?NoI mean, unless they're posting some really retarded shit.Pretty much no though.
no

Banned is his title. He isn't banned
i'm even more mad that the latest one is actually from WCD cuz he messaged me recently.
In all these months those fags haven't fixed their shit or even downloaded wtf. I think you only had like 5 invitees back then. Don't even know why they ask for an invite if they don't have storage or something, it's like those poorfags sitting on a PTP account and not doing anything.

>It's software could be the future of trackersAgreeI noticed a bunch of similarities between what their own software is like and the ideas I had for a project our team are going to be starting soon (could suck since we'll probably get shit over not being 'original', but it should turn out well either way)
what's even MORE worse is the sitewide freeleech there was in december, i even messaged them all.
Fuck off, faggot. Nobody is going to invite you to KG.
If you have access to private trackers, you have a moral duty to reupload to public trackers.By putting up with byzantine rules and regulations to share content with others, you martyr yourself for the good of mankind.Fight copyright.
What do you think you're accomplishing?
whats a solid tracker that one can get into from WCD for TV? I noticed freshon closed its invite thread. I think it's time for me to graduate from IPT.
BTN
I haven't had my accoutn for six months quite yet unfortunately. Maybe I'll just stick with IP until then.
Wait it out then because nobody gives a fuck about anything TV-related except BTN. BTN is god-tier for TV. Only thing it's missing is old, very obscure TV that you can find on TV Vault.
Sounds good. Thanks for the help doug.

If you receive one of these messages, there are a few possible fixes that have worked for us and for other people who have encountered the bug. If the Messages app was opened to the conversation with the person who sent the offending message, the Messages app can be reopened to this conversation. Sending a reply message fixes the problem. If Messages was opened to the conversation list view, the app will crash when you attempt to open it. You can fix this by having someone send you a message or by sending a message to yourself. There are several options for sending a message to yourself, including sending yourself a message via Siri or through the Share sheet in any app. To send yourself a message in Siri, tell Siri to "Send a message to myself." Siri will open up a dialogue where you can give her a quick message like "Fix" that'll be sent to your iPhone to clear away the malicious message. Alternatively, you can open an app like Notes, craft a quick note, and use the Share option (the little document with an arrow) to message it to yourself. Sending yourself something though the share sheet of an app opens a new messages window where you can enter your own contact information.

Can we have a shaving technology thread?Why are you still using shitty cartridge shaving systems, when you can get a better shave from double edge razors that cost only $0.10 a blade?
inhibiting your glorious guru beard is the exact opposite of the /g/ spirit
>using anything other than an electric razorFuck off back to hipsterville faggot.
Safety razors are a better buy for a lot of people.I don't let the beard grow, but if it did, it would be curly. A razor that I can't simply snap open and rinse out every few strokes, would clog constantly. I can't practically shave using normal ones.Some people only want tech they can buy in a big box store. Their loss.
But electric razors are the better modern options. Cartridge systems are the worst of both worlds.
I use a foil shaver that cleans itself and I roll my own cleaning solution.
Astras or Feathers?Why are feathers 3 times as expensive?
>clogging it up and having it painfully yank 50 years out at the same timeNo thanks.Straight razor master race.
I've tried everything, and have settled on a double edge razor.I enjoy shaving soap and real shaving cream and a badger brush, etc.My favorite blades are Personna or Feather blades.
Master race coming through
Why not get clippers and never have to buy razors or haircuts again?
I use a pair of nail scissors to trim my facial hair every now and then. I'm 22 years old.What the fuck is wrong with me?
My boyfriend uses this on his head. Are the six blade cartridges worth it.
I spend like 20 minutes doing 3 passes on my face and it still looks like I haven't shaved. Fuck everything.
Because clippers don't shave close enough. Far from it, in fact
>be black>don't need to shave because that's racist
I'll remember that the next time I don't want to be a man.
holy shit this thing is insane
He also has crow's feet and wimpy eyebrows like that guy.
why buy into a restrictive ecosystem that forces you to regularly buy more replacement blades when you could buy one straight razor that will last for decades, with proper care?
I've thought about it but I don't know if I want to spend time stropping it, what's your average shave take you time wise? Maybe it's not as bad as I think.
>restrictive ecosystem>10 cent bladesNot everyone makes a ritual out of their shaving routine, grampa.
Because a safety razor is easy to use.
>fill sink with hot water>wash face >apply shaving gel (I use canned stuff, don't see the point in bothering with a brush and cream)>shave, rinse blade every few strokes>apply gel again>shave in opposite direction (blade going towards top of head instead of towards feet)>rinse face>clean blade>strop (takes maybe 20 seconds)>clean counterwhole thing takes about 20 minutes if I'm relaxing and taking my time. I know most of /g/ will laugh at this but I like to use shaving as a meditation/zen time where I can just zone out with one simple task and zero distractions. if I'm hurrying, whole thing might take 10 minutes.good job recognizing mild hyperboleso is a straight razor if you're not a drooling retard. I started shaving with one when I was 16, never had a cut worse than a papercut. it just requires that you pay attention to what you're doing.
That sounds exactly like what I do now and the same time but better, maybe I will get one of these.>I know most of /g/ will laugh at this but I like to use shaving as a meditation/zen time where I can just zone out with one simple task and zero distractions.Even this, it's almost like a bonzai tree but it's your face, I always enjoy it.
I laugh at all you losers who spend 10 minutes "hydrating" their beards and applying soap with a unicorn hair brush.Shaving in the shower master race.
>not using an epilator or getting electrolysisPig disgusting. Facial hair is gross.
forgot pic
How do you avoid ripping your skin off?
You can't do that with facial hair, and hasn't electrolysis been superseded by lasers?
By having a good epilator? It's never been an issue for me so I don't know.
>/lgbt/
sweet, definitely look into it if you're interested. I've only owned the one razor and it was a gift, so I can't give any recommendations for a specific razor, but barbers/hairstylists are pretty knowledgeable about the subject, in my experience.>Even this, it's almost like a bonzai tree but it's your face, I always enjoy it.Yes, exactly. I grew out my facial hair a while back and I miss that feeling. It's hard as fuck to trim/style with a straight razor because they're so long.
Yes you can, there are epilators for the face.Laser is like 70-90% reduction IF you're pale with dark hair otherwise it doesn't really work at all but it is cheaper and faster. Electrolysis is 99.9% removal.

Over 4.4, 5.0 is a downgrade, 5.1.x is an upgrade, but a very minor one.On my older 1gb RAM device, CM 10.2 (4.2) > CM12.1 (5.1.1) > CM11 (4.4.4) > CM12 (5.0).It's kind of depressing that all these new releases for android that are focused on performance improvements seem to come along with many performance regressions each release.It seems like the memory demands on Android is dropping each release, but overall the device is slower.

I dont care about that, what pisses me off is that google is trying to copy apple so much(and failing) its fucking pathetic, android was supposed to be linux device, yet with every release more and more shit gets restricted, and the fucking icons, whats the fucking point of having 4k scren on my phone and have one/two color/flat icons? its so fucking disgusting!

FUCK
why does no one have it?
why is apple so based tbh
because deprecated? and most probably upgraded their phones or got an update to Ice Cream Sandwich.
Google dissolves completely as a company and life as we know it ceases
just seems weird considering the other lower versions that are still in use. would have thought a small % of people wouldn't bother updating
It was only for tablets, all of which either got updated or aren't used anymore
i guess some people still have it, but it's below 1% which is why it doesn't get shown in the statistics. but honeycomb is deprecated as fuck, it's even closed-source because they really don't want anyone to use it. it was only for tablets and i don't think it ever got really popular in the first place

they'll probably jump right to 6.0 since 5.x was a huge failure.

Worst of all, Google's best customers (i.e. people with money) are on iOS so Android has fucked up their relationship with Apple as well. And most of the "Android" devices don't even run Android but run AOSP which means Google's not getting anything from it.And new version of Android means that there will be even more fragmentation in Android ecosystem since no one updates their devices since no one gives a fuck about their customers.
see 
All in all though it doesn't even matter. It's really fucking easy to develop for older versions of Android anyways.

>Posts like this make me feel sick.you're jus tbutthurt because Apple cares about their customers while your phone's manufacturer doesn't. Android phones are abandonware as soon as you buy them because OEM’s don’t give a fuck about them after they separate you from your shekels. Enjoy being a gigantic sucker.
yes ios updates get trough fast but thats because Apple is directly sending updates to every iPhone. Android is where it is because google cant just update your device ota (unless you have nexus which get updates asap). google provides new build to manufactures for them to tailor to specific hardware which there are tons of and fuck up with custom homescreens and bloat... and then its up to manufacturer to decide if hes gonna update your device or fuck you over.tl;drif google waited for higher % for latest release there would be update every 6 years
The difference is that Apple is separating you from a fucking thousand shekels for a retarded iPhone when for 300 you can get a faster performing pocket computer.Look up Apple's profit margins and then tell me you're not a gigantic sucker.
>Apple cares about their customersthey just feel bad about raping your wallet while you don't even protest because you're too dumb to realise what's happening.

The worst part about Android is that nothing is standardized.So many apps are still stuck in their Holo phase, with no peeps from the devs. Even Google themselves and many popular apps STILL haven't switched to Material design yet (Facebook, Twitter, fucking Chrome). It's infuriating. Why design entire a new visual style rules when nobody is going to fucking use it?At least with Apple your shit is looked over before publishing.

Sucker? My android does 99% of what your iPhone does at 20% of the cost.
What's funny is that a Android phone on fucking ICS can still accomplish more than an iPhone 6

oh well, still less than 0.1% of the userbase, and i still have a fallback. not worth learning git and typing in a bunch of terminal commands just to check the source on 3.*i wonder why it's not on grepcode though, the have ICS and everything else
Not only that, in many cases it actually does offer improved battery life and other good stuff.People like making mountains out of molehills.>Lollipop has memory leaks and I don't like the design! IT'S LITERALLY WORSE THAN HITLERKitkat had problems too, and so did Jellybean. I wish people would bitch about real problems, like Google breaking core system functionality out into the closed-source Google Play Services.
flat UI design is fucking cancer though
Yes. This is what Icons should look like
We have 2k screens as the standard for flagships and have 4k on the way. Why the fuck not?
Because skeuomorphism in computer interfaces is gaudy as fuck.There's a pleasant medium between flat minimalist iconography and photorealistic skeuomorphism, but it actually takes talent to pull off, which is why it's not popular. The two extremes are easy, and which one is in vogue is just a matter of public opinion.
finally someone fucking gets itso many people bitch about Apple ditching skeuomorphism, yet it was the fugliest shit ever.icons are what ICONS should be. they need to represent what the program is without going in too much detail. sure, some detail is good, but photorealism is the absolute WORST thing that can be in an app icon.
>which one is in vogue is just a matter of public opinionjust a hunch but i don't think flat UI design is overwhelmingly popular, it's just execs wanting to imitate post-jobs apple and save money on designers
i'm not asking for photorealism, just something that doesn't look like it was made in mspaint. some shapes, edges, gradients. the human eye likes to see shapes and edges
>apple invented flat design>iOS 7 in 2013>7 years after Zune>3 years after WP7
Those execs want to copy Apple because Apple is a driver of public opinion. Flat minimalism was used in a lot of things before iOS7, but Apple made it popular. Plebs will parrot whatever Apple does as the height of design because they don't know enough to form their own opinions.Apple is frequently very good at design, but that doesn't mean they're infallible or that their best work is in any way indicative of the rest of their work. Frankly the iPhone 6 is a fucking mess, the device itself is as ugly as the original iPhone while being more awkward to hold.

how about...make mandatory stock android support for all phones.  Carriers and Manufacturers would still be free to customize how they like, as long as it was possible to get stock working either OOTB or with official and approved methods
Anything Google can do to grab this oem and carrier bloatware bullshit by the balls
I want to root my tablet but I'm hesitant to install CM12 on it because I don't really know what I'm asking for with Android 5. I'm not sure I like it that much having played with it on my dad's Nexus 7 2012.

Best VPN?
https://bitmask.net/en/featuresHaven't tried, but looked interesting enough.
proxy.sh
I use PIA, it's great. I torrent off a Raspberry Pi with OpenVPN and transmission-daemon. I wrote a script to make a web request to get a port forward, then configure transmission with that port.
A Digital Ocean instance is cheaper than that.
FrootVPN.  Started using it after Comcast started sending me emails weekly due to my downloading habits.  Haven't heard shit from them in months.
do they accept bitcoin?
I've been using ra4wvpn for a while. Lifetime is $15 usd, no logs, and quite a few locations.Speed is more than enough for my (shameful) 1MB/s download but I don't know what the actual cap is.
Explain more, please.
Is there any VPN that's reliable, doesn't require personal informations and accepts paysafe card?
Openvpn
That's a client, shithead.
it's client and server side
Yeah install openVPN on a home server and make your own VPN to navigate anonymously guise! It works I swear!!!1XDDDdD
But you would need a host server side, and that's what OP's question asked for.
When you connect to a VPN provider, you get a private IP address. "ip addr tun0" or similar will show you an address in the RFC1918 private ranges.You then NAT off a public IP address within the VPN provider when you access the internet through the tunnel.This is much like you have a private IP address within your home network and NAT off your internet router's public IP address.So of course, just like you need to port forward within your home network, so that other torrenters can connect back to your torrent client, you need to port forward within the VPN providers so other torrenters can connect back to your torrent client within the VPN.You also need to configure your torrent client to use the forwarded port.PIA provide a web interface for port forwarding, but you can also make the request via wget/curl and get JSON back.The following script works on Debian Wheezy:http://pastie.org/pastes/10208892/text?key=q9b8q2kpdrl5myagb6kfgIt assumes the VPN tunnel is already up and running, and you can't configure transmission when it's running. So run "sudo service openvpn start" then "sudo pia start". The pia script should stop/start transmission-daemon as required.Then access transmission-daemon over port 9091. eg http://raspberrypi:9091
>use PIA>all IPs are blocked by 4chanStop uploading CP you stupid fucks.
USE MULLVAD OR GET V&
Thank you
NordVPN has been great for me. Got two years for $39 through StackSocial and the service has been way better than PIA's was for me. They have more server locations too (including Japan and more obscure places like Chile, Lithuania and South Africa), plus double VPN and Tor over VPN options (which lets you browse .onion sites without even downloading the software), plus let you pick individual servers, rather than just the location.Based in Panama and claim all the usual stuff about keeping no logs etc. I've been pretty impressed.
I only get 8Mb/s with this on my 17Mb/s connection connected from UK to Sweden
I read some week ago an anon reported getting only 6 Mbit/s while he had a 75 Mbit/s home connection, using PIA. I guess it's a common thing, for that price.
PIA maxes my 30mbit even on Sweden servers across the globe.
That's neat, which subscription plan though?
PIA is an NSA infested US company.
[citation needed]Because it's hosted in US? 90% of VPN services have at least some server in US.
No citation required. The fact that it is hosted in the U.S means that they are forced to hand over and information including logs>B-b-but they dun keep logs >Their website says they dun keep logz they can't lie!You're fucked
Fuck anything hosted in the U.S or any U.S based VPN companyNVPN doesn't roll over on your ass.
PIA is sketchy as fuck. Also, don't get anything hosted in the US if you live there.AirVPN is pretty good.  Riseup also has a VPN now.To be honest, it doesn't really matter if they accept bitcoin if you are sending traffic from your home IP directly to the VPN.
Mind elaborating how besides being hosted in America they are sketchy?
PIA's whole business model is that there is no data retention laws in America, so they delete every login as soon as it happens. There is no way to tie an IP address to an account.So how are PIA sketchy as fuck?
They claim not to keep logs, but it's actually impossible to administrate a server without doing so.  They also mislead you on the level of privacy a VPN provides with hyperbolic language.  It's was also founded by Andrew Lee, a co-founder of Mt Gox.  If that doesn't give you pause, then it should.
https://www.ivpn.net/I'm using those guys. No idea how trustworthy they are, but the website came across as slightly less sketchy than all the rest
dude asked for a VPN solution and that's the best one
This all depends what you are using the VPN for. I just want to avoid copyright trolls.If someone was going to do CP or terrism or drugs or other things law enforcement is actually actively pursuing, then no commercial VPN is good enough.
You don't have to be doing something wrong to want more privacy and not to be spied on.There are reasons to suspect PIA does not provide that.
Fair enough, good point.To turn your criticism into constructive criticism, do you have an alternative suggestion for a service which DOES provide privacy?
for some reason I can tell you're 14 years old
>ra4wvpnThis looks almost too good to be true.  Can anyone confirm?
>if it's too good to be true..
has anyone used shadeyou? also this , never heard of them before
I made a couple of recs in my first post here:I think Riseup is free too.Tor and i2p both have known vulnerabilities, but they still provide better privacy than many VPNs.Another alternative is a good seedbox.  You can set up your seedbox (in most cases) with openvpn.
Just upgraded to PIA for a year, was on the monthly plan.
anyone know where to find those PIA annual-level discount coupons? ones where the yearly goes from 40 down to like half
I use cryptostorm, actually cryptofree, the throttled free server. Works great. I've used bitmask a bit too, not enough to form an opinion though.
AGAIN NVPN JESUS FUCKING CHRIST
So can you get in trouble for using the same VPN IP as somebody who did this? Since a ton of people are using these same IPs, right?
>(which lets you browse .onion sites without even downloading the software),So you just browse them in chrome and firefox or what?
Can you cite the law that requires us-hosted vpns to hand over logs? I'm genuinely curious, thanks
Which is the safest one?
I really want to like PIA, however they refuse to support blackberry.
I also use NordVPN.In the past I've used iVPN, Privacy.io, and AirVPN.I renewed with Nord. You simply cannot beat the level of features for the price.And unlike Private Internet Access, it absolutely is not based out of the US. PIA is seriously an NSA honeypot and I cannot believe people on /g/ recommend it, it's one of the few cases of shilling I believe is legitimate on here.
National Security Letters. It happened to Lavabit, the feds came and issued a secret order saying, let us in, right now, and we'll put you away if you tell anyone.
Yes.
>iVPNThat's the one I'm using right now, what made you switch?
Sorry I'm late but I can vouch for ra4wvpn. It's better than you'd expect for the price
Then where do the stories come from, I wonder?
>500 months for $15What the fuck. I don't believe this shit.
Just turn it off whenever you want to post. It aren't hard. Turn it back on when you want to do "other stuff"
>but it's actually impossible to administrate a server without doing so.It definitely is possible to do so, the Mt Gox thing on the other hand you have a point.
>be me>buy PIA account>pirate bay goes downwelp.
> PIA is seriously an NSA honeypot and I cannot believe people on /g/ recommend it, it's one of the few cases of shilling I believe is legitimate on here.PIA have stated they will shut down before they allow any PRISM-like access to their network.coderrr and the entire PIA admin/dev team actually moved out of the USA to make themselves more difficult to get to.I am not a shill, I genuinely think PIA is safe, as do TorrentFreak and BestVPN.

Is the windows 10 preview stable enough to use as a primary OS?
Might as well just wait for RC at this point.
It's stable enough to run videogames, which is the only thing that Windows should be used for.
>implying RC is going to be any more stable than Preview
I was running it for a little while, the only reasons I switched back to 8.1 is because of frame-rate problems in some games and lack of compatibility with corsair link.

I think it's going to be more forgiving on fresh install than previous versions when it's done.  I've been running it on a cheap Asus for the last month with no problems.
Why are we posting horrible image macros?
My issues were present on both a clean install and an upgraded install. I was using the enterprise preview as it was the latest officially available. The frame-rate issues probably have more to do with the available drivers than anything else. Oddly enough, Corsair Link would randomly launch on it's own and run for 15-30 minutes, but couldn't be opened through the shortcut. Even when it did work though, it failed to read some of the sensors.
If you dont mind the keylogger.
i was using the initial tech preview release as my .NET development environment. i've used vista, 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 in early release form as primary desktops. it is fine unless you are gonna cry the first time something crashes.

that's a gnomet. scaper
Law is fluid. Your information is not.  Just because things that you do aren't red-flag now doesn't mean they never will be.Also, just saying, but browsing 4chan isn't exactly "normie shit". It'd probably be relatively easy for you to be labelled as a pedophile if anyone wanted you v&.
I started to use noscript. And now I use glorious ublock origin. All my email is also signed and encrypted as if possible.

I made more shitty meme email accounts that I'll never use because nothing I do on the internet would trigger the NSA anyway
You could probably get labeled as pedo just because your connection once loaded a thumbnail of a hentai loli manga from /a/ or /b/ catalogs. Even if it's not illegal, it can be used to destroy your reputation.

Especially with /b/'s popularity after 2006/2007, there is no way the feds could cram that many people into jail. Same w/ torrenting. Not plausible to put literally everyone in prison like that.

I haven't seen ads on the internet for years and I'm sure you haven't either, so why do you care? Normies that are influenced by that shit pay the bills for all the sites you consume content from.

Because 1984 was not written as a prediction of the future, it was written as a critique and story about the horrifying reality of Stalinism.
>A deep packet inspection could incriminate anyone whose ever been on those boards.Not really incriminate, because 2d is not illegal afaik but anyone who has contacts in NSA and wants to throw shit at you (for whatever reason), they could pay a bribe and get all your data at once, then find compromising proofs for your reputation and send the informations anonymously to some blog or newspaper. Nobody would ever suspect where they got your infos from, you wouldn't even have the chance to complain.
Who said it was a prediction of the future? 1984 is just the year it was written.
>1922>Stalinism
Man sometimes I just want to check out.Abandon all modern technology and go live in a shack somewhere in Iceland.
It was published in the 40's dipshit
No and no.Why would the gubment care about the things I'm doing which aren't illegal
See:
Oh. Then it WAS a prediction of the future. confuses me now.
most people on here seem to act like it isalso it was written in 1949t. owner of a first edition copywhoops, 1924 was when Lenin got blown the fuck outit was more an anecdote of what it would be like than an actual prediction, orwell was fearful of the spread of stalinism but if you look at his backstory the entire premise of the book from a "will this actually happen?" perspective is basically horse shit and should be treated as suchif anything we're heading towards huxley's BNW but I don't think that's very realistic either
>most people on here seem to act like it isHow do they act? What gives them away?
I had already been making tinfoil changes before Snowden. But the leaks removed any doubt I had of taking this path.
>huxley's BNWEveryone who says this hasn't been paying attention to trends and history the past hundred years, seriously. This is getting ridiculous now. I expect newfags on /lit/ to say this, not people on /g/.

how is thunderbird?
No. I won't change my habits because some shitheads invade my privacy.No one should.
Check out ECHELON.The NSA didn't really ramp up the dragnet surveillance until STELLARWIND after 9/11 though.
I was paranoid enough to use Tor + Ixquick for a full two years before Snowden happened.The only habit I've learned since then was applying the grsec patches to my Linux kernel for extra tinfoil.
No. He's smoke to mask what's really going on. We've known about the things he's "leaked" for nearly 20 years, they knew and are appealing to that to make 'em shut the fuck up.>leaks are coming guys, watch out for 'em :^)nice.
No who cares its not like my info is gonna end up on CNN headlines, nor will I ever be famous enough anyone will give a shit. And if I ever do by some off chance become famous, I'll just say who the fuck hasn't done stupid shit
What I wrote doesn't even answer your fucking question.We're all doomed anyway, might as well continue on the way we were. Don't discard encryption though, it at least annoys the snoopers.
Not really. But I have become much more knowledgeable about encryption, and will start encrypting personal files when I travel. For me, it's not yet worth it to try to get out of the NSA's sights.However, I'm much more careful with how I deal with companies and services. I've switched to Linux to take Microsoft out of the equation. I've started trying Startpage for some searches just to see if I can use it to find what I need. I don't have a Facebook account and I use a script blocker so Facebook and the dozens of advertising companies with scripts and cookies can't track me as easily.
Who cares its been happening, and it always will even if it becomes illegal to spy they don't gaf they just will continue
My guess is that Snowden was a test to see if everyone would self censure. Imagine if it worked. All the gov would have to do is 'leak' some bogus surveillance tech and everyone would be managed. I'm also guessing that people are still looking up just as much porn but they are probably censuring any more radical ideas that might be construed as a threat.

>Edward Joseph "Ed" Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American computer professional who leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) to the mainstream media, starting in June 2013.From WikipediaBasically, he worked as a contractor for a US domestic spying agency. He stole documents about computer/internet based spying on US citizens, and got the government very mad. Many of us in the US like him, though, too.
I haven't googled something in about 2 years, outside of work/school. I only use my google email for work/school.The only fucking weak link is the fucking 4chan captcha, why doesn't it fall back properly to the noscript captcha like on other websites !?
Yes, I had a meltdown and did maximum trolling, but I'm happy to know the truth.
Define normal.Now fuck off.
I'm happy to know the truth, but the truth pissed me the fuck off.
there's other chans that value privacy dude
Does anyone here know or have used GMX mail?

Why do people keep pretending the NSA is only reading Google shit?You niggers weren't paying attention at all.You also weren't paying attention when it was revealed they're sucking up all the data at the service-provider level from Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, etc.So, great, you stopped using Gmail. Good for you anon. You're invisible now. Good job anon.
i like 8/tech/ better than 4/g/ tbh. and the pace is better. a thread lives longer. i'd actually say there's more porn threads here. but the bigger file limits and audio webms are good i guess
I've always been cautious on the internet years before him.
No because I have nothing to hide ;)
Even though I haven't been on /b/ in almost 3 years now I'll always be a b-tard at heart and I enjoy the shitposting culture of 4ch.I don't really expect much except news and memes. Though I am sometimes surprised by a good conversation here and there.
>browsing technololigy>not pedoayy
i dunno if it's just that over the years i've gotten more cynical, but 4ch users seem to get dumber every summer. when i first tried 8ch it felt like 4ch used to
i'm more careless lately.The thing is there is so much surveillance, they don't even know how to process it.The 26/11 attack in india could've been prevented because the email was sniffed by NSA, but there were so many of the emails they couldn't predict the attack.Even if my emails are being tracked, chances are no one has looked at them with their eyes. Only bots are looking through my emails and looking for suspicious words.Who cares?
I would't say they are dumber, they're just... normies. Comes with the bigger population I guess.
He wasn't the reason but he was part of it. I switched to linux started getting more into security, started signing all of my emails and setting up encryption between me and everything and at work taking security super serious. So I am not at all perfect but I am a lot better than I have been.
No, because I knew everything he's said was true before he leaked all of it.Anyone with any intelligence knew that shit long before he said anything.
well yeah exactly. 4chan is mainstream now. it's not much more than an edgier reddit. along with the normies coming in, a lot of the more extreme users (including pedos and neo nazis as well as hardcore techies) fucked off to 8. it's got much better privacy policy, that's why i brought it up in a privacy thread
It did, for a while. I tried to go all in with using linux once and for all, ditching Chrome as much as possible and trying to reduce my reliance on Google's apps and services.I've mostly given up now though. I've resigned to going back to using OS X and gmail is still my primary email. Back to using Chrome to because I prefer it to Firefox.I've debated whether I should use a VPN or not, but I feel uncomfortable letting a third party possibly log all my internet traffic...The situation really feels hopeless. Except for keeping some sensitive files out of the cloud all I really do nowadays is to use Duckduckgo when I search for movie streams, medical conditions and things like that.I suspect the above is true for the majority of people even here on /g/. It takes a lot of effort to not give up.
To add to this, In principle I'm all for companies being allowed to choose and discriminate freely who to hire and on what grounds, but the amount of data that I might leak online makes me incredibly cautious about posting a lot on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter etc. Even though I feel too old for 4chan nowadays it's still the place where I feel the most comfortable contributing to a conversation online.
It's natural to hide certain things from certain people, and there's no reason someone hiring someone to do something at work should care too much what they do outside of that.

Should I bother waiting for the 3xx series? People here seem to think they are a 'rebrand' or something, and are marginally better than the current 2xx series. Could someone clarify this for me? Is it worth waiting to get a 3xx or just go for the reasonable priced 290?Also, how much difference in performance would I see upgrading to a 290 or 390?
Just wait for the 3xx series it's only a month away
just buy a r9 290, price isn't going to drop more even with a new launch unless you want ones with really shitty cooling. Unless you want to spend more than $500, nothing new will be released other than overclocked versions of the 290/x
Whats a R9 290 card with good cooling system? Are you talking about ones that are 'twinfrozr'?
At least wait a week for the Computex conference where they'll finally give us actual info about what the fuck the 300 series is.
The 300 series is OEM only, just like the HD 8000 was a while ago. The only card that will hit retail will be the flagship 390X, which will be at a higher price point than the 290 ones.There's no point in waiting now, the real next series from AMD will only come when 16/14 nm is ready, that might be only 2016. If you're eyeing the 290, might as well go for it.
Ignore these other retards, wait until full tonga is released and pick up one of them.More than enough for 1080/1440 gaming while being much more energy efficient than hawaii.
>wait until full tonga is releasedFull Tonga is released as R9 295M.If you mean desktop, then that is never, because like I said he 300 series is OEM only.Also, Tonga is not much more efficient than Hawaii. Check some reviews, they found no substantial difference between the 280/280X and the 285 in power consumption.
280/X aren't hawaii.The 300 series is NOT oem only, that would be retarded.
>The 300 series is OEM onlyCare to provide source?I don't recall AMD saying anything on the 300 series, other than some vague comments made during their Financial Analyst Day a few weeks back.
I meant that GCN 1.2 isn't any more efficient than previous GCN versions, which is shown by comparing the 285 to the 280 series.Also,>http://www.anandtech.com/show/9241/amd-announces-oem-desktop-radeon-300-series
there is alot of misinformation spread around by trollsthe 380/X is the replacement for the 290/x series It is not a rebrand it is Tonga Arch (285) expanded up to 290 size so think of a 285 with 4gb of GDDR5 and double the GCN coresThe 290 will price drop but only a little since its already discounted but nvidia will price drop alot because they will lose their performance edge in every single category and have to become the value buy to compensateThe tonga based 380X will beat the shit out of the gtx 980 howver im not sure if it will outperform the 980ti but since that will be a different price bracket it wont need tonow the new GPU AMD is building is technically in a new Category altogether  its their Enthusiast grade GPU which also is designated as the 390Xyes this is confusing as fuck i know and its entirely AMD's fault for being shit with naming schemes but for the time being consider the X-80 to be the new top point for consumer grade chips and the X-90 to eb the "Titan" class for AMD gpu'sthats where all the confusion is from and nvidia trolls have capitalized on it to shitpost
even if the 300 series was OEM only, they're still going to release a desktop full Tonga, Tahiti is too old and power hungry, and would spank everything except refreshed Hawaii cards
Also to you 
Honestly not something you'd expect AMD to hide away. A product launch is a product launch after all.
Well OP one of the things that you should ask yourself is WHY you're looking at upgrading in general. If there is a solid reason that you need it now then get a 290. If not then I would wait to see what they come out with and what the benchmarks look like. On a side note are you looking at upgrading just to have something more powerful or are you looking to play a game that your rig cannot handle right now?Those are typically the questions I ask myself before I upgrade. This is coming from someone typing this on a PC with the following specs:CPU: AMD FX 8120 [OC to 4.7 Ghz]RAM: 16 GB of 1866 Mhz GSkill MemoryGPU: Sapphire AMD Radeon 6870I haven't had the need to upgrade for the past 4-5 years. Plan on upgrading when DDR4 comes mainstream and the next available AMD chip comes out.
>nothing new will be released other than overclocked versions of the 290XThis is false.
>It is not a rebrand it is Tonga Arch (285) expanded up to 290 size so think of a 285 with 4gb of GDDR5 and double the GCN coresAre you retarded?For starters, Tonga is not an architecture, it's a single chip built with the GCN 1.2 architecture.Second, you can't expand Tonga to double the compute units the 285 has, you idiot. The full Tonga, as used in the 295M, only has 32 compute units, compared to 28 in the 285. At best, you can make it go from 1792 to 2048 stream processors by activating he last four compute units, and that's nowhere remotely close to making it faster than a GTX 980.The ONLY new chip AMD is introducing is Fiji (390X). Everything else is an previously existing chip, and as Anandtech reports they are OEM part, not retail.
Nothing new thats not over $500 will be released.
This is true.
It's a product launch to OEM partners, like the HD 8000 series was, and like the GTX 300 series was for Nvidia.They have no reason to go out informing consumers of this. First, because they won't even be able to buy those cards. Second, it'll only add to confusion, because their numbering scheme isn't the clearest when compaing to the 200 series.
you keep talking about the MOBILE GPU like its the desktop, which is completely false, and Tonga is am arch you fucking Dingus, it will be considered a rebrand because of the 285
>only new chipFull tonga + fiji means 4 new cards in the range with the rest being updates.And you're a fucking idiot if you believe the 3xx will be OEM.
I recently purchased an r290x.Runs everything great aside from top down games. Diablo 3, Path of Exile, Torchlight 2.In these games I have terrible microstutter while running around. Im on the most recent beta drivers. Tried clean uninstall/install of various driver versions no dice. Any ideas?
Hol crap, how can you be this stupid?Tonga is a CHIP, NOT an architecture, you fucking retard. GCN is the architecture.Tonga is just one of the chips to come from the GCN (version 1.2 specifically), which also includes Hawaii and Bonaire (1.1) and Tahiti, Pitcairn and Cape Verde (1.0).Comparing with Nvidia, Tonga is to GCN what GM204 is to Maxwell.Tonga is not a new chip, dimwit. It was already used on the 285 and the 295M. The only chip never used before is Fiji.Also,>http://www.anandtech.com/show/9241/amd-announces-oem-desktop-radeon-300-series
"Tonga" is the codename for GCN 1.2 architecture you fucking moron all GCN 1.2 chips are tonga chips
> Everything else is an previously existing chip, and as Anandtech reports they are OEM part, not retail.>as Anandtech reports>as Anandtech reports>as Anandtech reportsand thats when we all stopped taking you seriously
that is not true in the least, tonga is the internal code name for the chip powering the 285 and m295x
No, it's not. Fiji is also based on GCN 1.2.Stop being so overwhelmingly retarded. Tonga is the name of ONE chip, the one with 32 compute units, 32 ROPs and a 256-bit bus.Cry all you want. I provided a source, you did not.

Op here;Honestly, my 6970 is a beast. It runs practically any game I throw at it (albeit latest games on ULTRA settings), but its been such an amazing card, I cannot fathom how amazing a card 2 generations above mine would perform. I built my pc all at once, my specs are as follows;Cpu i7 2700k RAM 8gb (like it matters lol)SSD with windows installed on itstock cooling for everything.The only thing I fault about my card is that it sounds like a train when the fans kick in, and it loves chewing wattage. If I were to upgrade, I would be looking for a card that runs more efficiently, doesn't require such industrial cooling methods that distract me from my games, and something thats much lower in terms of wattage. I have been considering the 290 for a while, only for it being more advanced than my current card, that it wouldnt need to use its full potential to run games, as a result, would run quieter. Although I do realise that the 290 itself also requires a lot of wattage.
Look bruh I googled and read countless threads.Figured it couldn't hurt to ask. At least my butt isn't hurting idk about yours though
use a frame limiter
basically anything without a reference/blower style cooler
all speculative clickbait bullshit, not even an and tech knows exactly what they're launching because AMD hasn't said a fucking thing you complete fucking faggot
AMD is likely leaking false information at this point to be honest. They been having problems with leaks for a while and I think they might be cracking down.
Some might be rebrands I'd be shocked if all were

Are you scared of AI? Why or why not?
Pretty good movie, not amazing though. MAde me slightly paranoid.Also, Alicia Vikander is a qt
Yeah man. Evolution finds a way. We can put up barriers all we want but I fear there's always going to be that tipping point and then it's all over.
I find it funny how people are so afraid of AI when we have a much more real and immediate threat: humans.Humans are fucking up our earth. Humans are responsible for slavery and wage slavery. Humans cause wars. Humans pollute the environment. Humans use fossil fuels and deny climate change. Humans are going to kill off humans... are we're worried about super intelligent robots that don't even exist yet? Our current "supercomputers" aren't even as smart as someone with down syndrome. They're just super fast calculators and they can't think.
tldr your hippie bullshit
>Our current "supercomputers" aren't even as smart as someone with down syndromeHaving the intelligence of a downy would mean no more than 5 years until the AI goes superintelligent. And that's a very pessimistic estimate
Why can't I be afraid of both
The worse AI will figure out how to do is be able to classify pictures of cats correctly. I'm really not that worried since no significant amount of research effort is going into engineering human-like AI.

So I'm working on this old guy's website and the old admin did some funny stuff. There is a custom CMS and a directory with log-in history. I think the guy made a mistake with concatenation with the php script because it logs the password obscurely in plaintext when the log-in fails. So if you fail the log in, I can figure out the incorrect password. What's funny is that the guy messed up his username while trying to log in so it gave me his correct password haha.
I sent my CV, cover letter and links to 5 sites that I coded to a digital agency that are looking for a junior front end dev last week. On Thursday they sent me a technical challenge to complete a homepage in 3 hours using bootstrap and for extra credit to embed a google map with custom icon,add a bunch of animations, and add a bunch of checkboxes that dynamically update a string in a h1 tag of how many checkboxes you've ticked.They got back to me today and said they won't pursue my application further.What do these companies want in a junior? I thought what I did in 3 hours was more than acceptable. Should I have not used a css animation library and jQuery?
Holy shit eclipse is bad.Is there any reason why I can't just use a text editor?
SQL is webdev. 
Nah dude, I guess you're right here. They can't expect too much by a junior dev.I don't think they didn'tn't take you because you didn't fulfill the requirements, I guess they just found someone who fulfilled them better.
HOLY SHIT, I FUCKING HATE CSS SO MUCH.
How long had you been coding for, just curious? Also, could you give more details on what they wanted you to do on the site? That blows man, should've had the job
whatchu tryin 2 figure out homie
What are you making/what language? I use regular Sublime 3, but I use Node.js
Use Netbeans it is pretty good or Sublime it's all up to you what you prefer.You will learn to love it like you will learn to love the D
I'm starting learning tomorrow. What I wanna do is itemize a list of skills that I need to grab, at least in a beginner level, before I consider myself "good enough" to apply for junior job openings.My main focus will be JavaScript (Angular?) and Node. What else should I know besides that?So far my list has:HTML, CSS, JavaScript, git, MEAN, some familiarity with the command line and tools, algorithms (I heard Khanacademy has an algorithms course using JavaScript, sounds fun) and design patterns.What am I missing?
I hate projects with jquery ui. shit always blows into my face, adds millions of classes and elements, always makes problems after updates.
css is great, don't be like that
When learning Angular you should go for TypeScript also.
You are going backend, correct?You have pretty much what I would put on a list. With Node.js, make sure you look into Express as well. Framework for Node that makes it much better to develop in the long run
So I'm using a php framework for the first time ever, it's called slim and I'm using this along Twig template(I never used a template system like twig)..and holy shit this is awesome. It's like using bootsrap but for phpThe problem I see is that there are not to many tutorials teaching me how improve my php skills using slim, so I'm asking you, do you know a php framework that is more or less easy to learn and has a shit ton of tutorials/guides/youtube videos/whatever?>inb4 "laravel 5". I don't know, that shit seems way above my knowledge.Also how do I organize my project using MVC pattern? Between using slim, bootstrap, sass(scss is for faggets) and gulpJs, my folder structure is pretty fucked at the moment
Yep, backend. Although companies who use node ask for either a frontend guy with node familiarity or a full stack.I'm planning to be able to work remotely by the end of the year. My fallback solution, if my node attempt gets shot down, will be to learn php.
You seem to be going for what most would go for. Just learn what you have on your todo list. You will eventually stumble upon technology while learning (I found Jade by accident, and its my favorite template system)
So, has Laravel finally made php developers out of their ostracism by the rest of the web dev community?
You are missing PHP and SQL
Also, Wordpress and bootstrap
see I'm leaving them last as fallback scenario.
Pretty much. Though you still might get hate from some
I would start with Front end HTML CSS first then Javascript,PHP,SQL, and lastly Wordpress and Bootstrap
Yep, that's how it'll go.
On and off about two yearsThat's all they said was build a homepage within three hours using bootstrap.For extra points it needed a responsive slider (I used owl carousel for this), user driven animations (I used wow.js and amimate.css) and a custom Google map (I used the Google map Api for this).I've spoken to a few friends who are senior debs and they seem to think they want to hire a medium level Dev at a junior level salary
Thats what it sounds like. Pretty shitty that happened, but some companies are like that. Keep trying, and you will find one soon enough.What city are you located in? Im curious
Capitalist pigs!Anyway I have another year left of my studies, I was going to leave and start working as the general consensus is that most people in web Dev are self taught anyway. Nevermind, I'll hopefully get a mid level job by the time i finish studying next year
Most Web devs are, but a lot of companies want a  CS degree, which is a piss off because I know a bunch of CS people who cant do any type of programming, and have a better chance than I do because of the degree
Any good resources to properly learn PHP? I checked plebbit's PHP sub but they claimed that the FAQ is outdated.
Don't judge them from what they ask on the job posting. If you're good they'll take you.

Possible stupid question : why is angular a thing? Surely you'd want to use a backend framework like express that can link to a cms and a database to input new data rather than hard code it into angular.Example : I own a restaurant. I need to add new dishes to my menu. If the site is using angular, then all my dishes are in a controller that has been input by a Dev. To change that I have t have a working knowledge of angular and a text editor to add more dishes. If I had a backend Mvc framework that can communicate with a database ten I can add new dishes to the database using a gui cms interface.Have I misunderstood something or is this how it is?
;_;
this and php7. still wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole, but whateveroh god>Have I misunderstood somethingI think you did
I've been thinking of getting into webdev, I know c# a bit since before. Is ASP.net a viable framework to go with? I know C#, SQL. Thought I'd pick up html,css,javascript and build something with that.
last part for yes, asp.net mvc
For your example, proper usage of angular would be to retrieve the list of dishes from your backend and display it on the HTML page, possibly filtering or sorting them while doing so. You should not store the list of dishes itself within your frontend.In short, yeah you kind of missed the entire point of angular
sass made css fun again for me. And I don't even know the fancy shit, I just use the includes and nesting.
use a preprocessor
Thanks for clearing that up for me.In the codecademy tutorial they get you to put the product details in the controller on the front end which I thought was odd.So angular is all about sorting / formatting / displaying data on the front end?I'm guessing you need a small amount of knowledge of the backend to fully use angular to the best of its abilities?
>So angular is all about sorting / formatting / displaying data on the front end?Angular is specifically about simplifying the process of binding data you retrieve from a backend to your HTML page, specifically tailored for use in SPAs.>I'm guessing you need a small amount of knowledge of the backend to fully use angular to the best of its abilities?Generally speaking you should at least know how to communicate with a backend.
>a small amount of knowledge of the backendI'm currently building a service that will allow people to store small amounts of data online without having to deal with setting up a database etc.I'm using that for my smarthome to store the temperature and the humidity without having to setup a database only for that, I'm using the API I built. So theoretically, one doesn't necessarily need backend knowledge (although it's advised).
Does anyone have a working example of 3D text with three.js?  Something that is only a few lines.  I can't seem to get it working.
>3D text with three.jshttp://threejs.org/examples/webgl_geometry_text.html
Yeah, that's the only working example I could get, but it's like 500 loc.  I condensed it down to the relevant parts and compared it to other examples, but it never works.
they don't fix the fundamental problems inherent to css
Nothing can fix it so you will have to get over it and use tools to at least make the job easier
There is nothing wrong with css
CSS is the PHP of frontend development. Everybody hates it, but nobody can tell you why
I prefer PHP over Java
This.
I think Java is the most retarded programming language out of all of those ones I have tried. I have done Javascript, PHP, SQL, Bash scripting, Ruby, Java, and Python. Java is just a big headache.
We're having to deal with it at university here. It's okay, it's only half a year. But still, I don't see any use in it. Even a friend of mine who actually is a Java fanboy suggested me to use Python or something else for everydayneeds scripting.
Yes, stay away from it I have done two courses on it at university it's stupid.
sup /wdg/ I'm gonna be honest here. I'm totally lost. I want to into webdev but there are so many options out there I have no idea where to start. I dabbled in Laravel and found it pretty cool, but when it comes to JS and all of it's frameworks and tools I have no idea. I want to learn how to make web apps that are modern (SPA, good visuals). What path should I take to be able to do this?Thanks guys
>web apps that are modernDo you have something in mind? At least for me it's usually the best to get into something but working towards a goal - in this case it would be a specific website I'd have in mind. That's how I started to webdev, I coded a specific module that was needed (nothing big, some office stuff).
Well I have a few ideas, nothing I really need to make but some challenging stuff for practice. An web IRC client or a video chat app would be my ultimate goal. What I mean by modern is apps that aren't just static pages with some dynamic stuff, a full application
Well, as a PHP webdev, I'd suggest PHP for the backend (or some easy service to get started) and bootstrap (when I started I concentrated on the backend, not frontend). Later then you'll get frustrated with bootstrap and write your own CSS stuff.At least that's how it went for me.>web IRC clientThat sounds like some live thing with sockets and shit. I don't know anything about node.js, but I guess it's worth a look if that's your goal.
Basically you're gonna want to master the fuck out of JS and all its concepts. You'll eventually discover things that are a bit of a pain or common tasks that you have functions for in every single application you make.When you realize you're copy-pasting your boilerplate functions between projects, you'll realize that there's probably a better way. That's what libraries are. See what good ones are in the mix and be amused by them, then pick a couple to learn (jquery and angular).Libraries are nice for when you want to quickly achieve a common/easily expressable goal in a language.Frameworks are one or more libraries/templates across one or more languages. For example, Bootstrap is a framework that boilerplates a ton of css and has a js library/clusterfuck.Frameworks are nice when you want to quickly achieve a common/easily expressable goal in an entire web application (normally at the cost of originality, but not always).A good way to practice is by making games, like tic-tac-toe, minesweeper etc. playable in the browser. That'll let you practice with states and MVC stuff that you'll use in your SPAs.I'm still growing a lot in these ways too
Ok this is great, thanks anonNow one more thing, what specific framework would be best to learn right now for general purpose development? I know Angular is common, but I also hear about React and others. I know that eventually a framework will be super important to my projects, so I want to master at least one.
Where do I put the "About"-Button?
slim is for small projects, i think it does provides a default views directory (templates/) but i'm just guessing. anything bigger than a SPA or a restful service requires a different approach.
I personally try to stick to projects backed by Google. So I'd say Angular. I'm about to jump ahead and start making Angular 2.0 apps for my online resume.There's a lot of reasons I don't like Google, but it's undeniable that coding projects they start tend to stick around.Both are really great and there's a few others, but my choice wasn't made so much on features, it was on future-proofing.
Yeah I get a bit nervous about relying on "random" code in my projects (I'm new to webdev but not to coding in general). I just read about people using laravel as their backend, which feeds into angular, what do you think about this kind of approach?
>relying on "random" code in my projectsAn investment that will pay off 100 times more than libraries/frameworks is learning about best practices/organization/structure. Seriously.I'm not saying you need to be perfect in your early applications, but you'll certainly trip yourself up during them, wondering what the best way to do something is when you notice your code is turning out messy. Remember that, and learn how others are setting their stuff up. This is something I regret not taking seriously early on.Libraries won't be able to help with this much, but they're still really nice. Laravel is correct for PHP, but remember that front- and back- end are completely different faces.In other words, don't code your back-end API to return data in a way that perfectly fits your front-end application. Make the API return the data in the way that's its most intuitive data structure, and your front-end application can sort it out for how it'll use it from there.Also if you're going to use libraries it's often neat to look at their code to see how they implement some of the features you like. It's just good to have that experience imo
At the top obviously.
Where exactly? Whereever I put it, it looks shitty.
Guys, honestly, is Meteor a meme? I've been dabbing in it and everything is so simple. What's the catch?
Good tips, thanks again. I'm using webstorm on osx right now and it works well, is anything else recommended or is it pretty much a matter of preference?
Matter of preference.Most people tend to use Sublime Text 3 as a text editor and GitHub for version control/collaboration, but beyond that basically whatever you want.Personally, my task runner is Grunt (task runners do stuff like minify, compile, compress, move etc depending on what tasks you set up for a project), my FTP client is FileZilla, and my stack is XAMPP (someone please recommend me a better way, i feel like a faggot still using this).
Try a little square button with a question mark instead of "About."
Welp that's a smart idea.I'm not that much of a frontend dev.
Yeah I actually want to know if this is legit or not
Sorta off topic, but why is there a web dev general and not a software dev general? Especially since /g/ is always like "hurr durr web dev is not real programming".
There is a few annoyances I have with it, but not as much as people seem to make it. Ive used it for so long that all my gripes with it are gone, but I can understand from a beginners perspective that it can be annoying
/dpt/ pretty much covers that, but I guess it could be useful to have one
I think this thread includes web designers too, and not just purely programming.
Sorta not answering your question but people seem to think that web development is grabbing a CMS and adding some widgets and sometimes or custom javascript.Other guys realize that using an MVC, adding routes, writing models is not programming.But people that have faced real challenges (not daily crap clients want) realize that in those cases web dev can turn into heavy shit programming.
I have a question I'm hoping someone may be able to help me with. I'm a second year Mechatronics Engineering student living with my parents, I've done a few general CS courses and have a rough grasp on things like Python and Pascal. Most of my experience is in C doing embedded system type stuff though.Having no experience in web dev at all, how reasonable of a goal is it for me to want to learn as much as I can in my spare time (about to have a few weeks off for mid year break) to be proficient enough to start looking to make some money by the end of the year? I'd like to supplement my shitty retail job with something that I actually enjoy and am challenged by, and something that may be worthy to put on my resume in the future.
That feeling when you've more or less finished another project after a night of coding.Aww fuck yiss now I'm gonna find a few betas and then I'll launch the page. Yess.If you have already some programming knowledge, there's a chance that you'll find a company that hires untrained webdevs. As a junior you wouldn't make a shitton of money, but only a few weeks won't make a difference there anyway.
Who typescript here?I'm hype as fuck for Ecmascript6
Vanilla or bust.
typescript is basically ecmascript6, which comes out in a month or two. so it's going to be vanillaalso good luck doing object oriented programming in js without the ease of being able to say "class", "extends" and "super"It's possible but having those key words makes things so much easier
what exactly do you want to learn?
It's really not hard typing "prototype" before a function.
but fatal bug appears and you shit yourself
Nah. The project is a one man simple project, any fatal problem can be fixed in an hour tops.
like this?function obj = {};obj.prototype.dicks = function(){ console.log("dicks"); };function ob2(parent){var that = {};for property in parent.prototypethat.prototype[property] = parent.prototype[property];return that;}cocks = new obj;morecocks = ob2(cocks);
What music do you listen to while you are "in the zone?"
or... this?function dicks(){this.dicks = "dicks";}function cocks(){that = this;function cocks(){parent = new dicks();for property in parent.prototypethat.prototype[property] = parent.prototype[property];}this.dicks = "I overwrote dicks.dicks";}
or this?<!doctype html><html><head><meta charset="utf-8"></head><body></body><script>function base(x, y){    this.x = x || 0;    this.y = y || 0;}base.prototype.func = function(){ console.log("func()"); };function child(x, y, speed){    for ( key in e = new base(x, y) )        this[key] = e[key];    this.speed = speed || 0;}se = new child(10, 20, 30);console.log(se);// child inherits base's prototype functionse.func();console.log("x: " + se.x + "\ty: " + se.y);</script></html>
I listened to this earlier:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_c3JUf6EOU
>function dicks(){>this.dicks = "dicks";>}Yes.function xyz(value1, value2, ...valuen){  this.X = value1;  this.Y = value2;  this.N = valuen;}var obj_xyz = [];  obj_xyz[0] = new xyz(a,b,...,n);
How about this?var __extends = this.__extends || function (d, b) {    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];    function __() { this.constructor = d; }    __.prototype = b.prototype;    d.prototype = new __();};var Animal = (function () {    function Animal(name) {        this.name = name;    }    Animal.prototype.move = function (meters) {        alert(this.name + " moved " + meters + "m.");    };    return Animal;})();var Snake = (function (_super) {    __extends(Snake, _super);    function Snake(name) {        _super.call(this, name);    }    Snake.prototype.move = function () {        alert("Slithering...");        _super.prototype.move.call(this, 5);    };    return Snake;})(Animal);var Horse = (function (_super) {    __extends(Horse, _super);    function Horse(name) {        _super.call(this, name);    }    Horse.prototype.move = function () {        alert("Galloping...");        _super.prototype.move.call(this, 45);    };    return Horse;})(Animal);var sam = new Snake("Sammy the Python");var tom = new Horse("Tommy the Palomino");sam.move();tom.move(34);
was transpiled into javascript from this typescript:class Animal {    constructor(public name: string) { }    move(meters: number) {        alert(this.name + " moved " + meters + "m.");    }}class Snake extends Animal {    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }    move() {        alert("Slithering...");        super.move(5);    }}class Horse extends Animal {    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }    move() {        alert("Galloping...");        super.move(45);    }}var sam = new Snake("Sammy the Python");var tom: Animal = new Horse("Tommy the Palomino");sam.move();tom.move(34);
What's a fork of Firefox that isn't shit?>inb4 use chrome/chromium

Netscape
Netscape isn't a fork of Firefox

The cool kids are into IceCat these days.IceWeasel is valid if you're on debian.The rest is shit.
Firefox was a fork of Netscape.
But will the addons that I have on firefox work in iceweasel?
Not a fork, but SeaMonkey.
>tfw just got iceweaselI was impressed how it read all my current addons and bookmarks from firefox but>deep dark theme didn't work>download helper didn't work>greasemonkey didn't workWhat do?
Yes. Addons generally work with iceweasel, since it's a rebranded version of a stable (supported) firefox version. You might need to finagle with compatibility checking or find alternatives in rare cases, but I'm pretty sure what /g/ uses works.
Greasemonkey's in the repos. Not sure about the other two. What do you use download helper for?
Nothing really, I had it there for years, I used it for some videos, but then never touched it again. But it has pretty nice video link detection.Do you mean I have to get greasemonkey from github or should I get icewease from github? Or whatever it is in?
gnu icecat isn't bad
* Debian's official repositories.https://packages.debian.org/jessie/xul-ext-greasemonkey(Unless I'm bad at reading debian's package site, which is very possible.)youtube-dl is nice for youtube videos. I've always used file2hd (dot com) when I needed video link detection on other sites, but there are probably more like it if it looks too sketchy.
SeaMonkey, the official browser of /g/.Use it.
Alright, I have downloaded it but I'm not sure why it still says "Incompatible" in the about:addons page. Do I have to remove and put it back? I don't wanna lose my scripts though.Also yeah, I recently checked out youtube-dl earlier today and it's pretty good.
Are you using an older version of Iceweasel than the version of Firefox you were on?  That could disable the version of Greasemonkey you have installed.  You should be able to fix it by just updating Iceweasel or installing an older version of Greasemonkey.
>31.7.0Oh rip, getting it from the current debian repository is so outdated.
Tried using the Windows version of icecat but it crashes on launch every time I try to use it.

>any tipsI wasn't prepared
I was tempted but I'll stick with 21 for at least a couple of weeks, just in case. Upgrading at day one just feels... unwise.
I think I'll stay with my fedora 20 installation for few more weeks. Does it come with dnf by default now, or does it still use yum?
>torrentthis stuff is illegal though
I'll stick with 21 for a while until I check it's not going to break everything I run. Also muh three 9s uptime.
Yes dnf is default now u fat shit
I tried it, but their repos are too stiff with their requirement for maintained packages. I can't easily get/upgrade Mumble.
GDM is now pure wayland in F22, neat.
How much difference does this make?
In what respect? Visually nothing but under the hood X is getting gradually replaced by Wayland.
I dunno. I've realised Arch's package manager is shit so I'm still tossing up between manmode (Gentoo), or easy street (Debian/Fedora). Right now I'm leaving towards manmode, things were pretty straight forward when I tested it in virtual box and the package manager is brilliant compared to Arch.
How do I perform the upgrade?I'm running 21 right now.Never done this sort of thing before.I mostly just use Linux for fiddling around.
sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root
ebin, dude.
FedUp u fat shit
I bet this is what some people actually believe.

> Why haven't you installed it yet /g/?OP, I am using Arch since late 2012 (before that *buntu since 6.06)I am keeping eye on Fedora and OpenSUSE but it would be downgrade for me to start using them.Just AUR. How am I supposed to install all that rare software on Fedora or OpenSUSE?Binary 3rd-party repos? I don't trust them. I already must trust upstream, official Arch maintainers and my understanding of PKGBUILDs.With Fedora, Ubuntu or OpenSUSE one must add 3rd-party maintainers to his trust-chain or compile rare shit by himself which is probably often only solution when something even doesn't exist in binary form for these distributions.I am well aware of all fucked-up things on Arch but this distro is still better for me than Fedora.I don't have spare time so I must use Arch Linux. (Ironic, I know.)BTW, Fedora Core 4 was my first linux distro I installed on my PC back in 05/06.
Why not? It's like rhel but with newer packages good for a desktop system
>Just AUR. How am I supposed to install all that rare software on Fedora or OpenSUSE?>Binary 3rd-party repos?You're joking right? How is AUR (which is a community repo) safer than a fucking copr/rpm-sphere/whatever?
Running 21 mate edition. From the release announcement there's no change to the mate-related shit. Iirc 21 will be updated till fedora23 is released.Would there be any benefit from upgrading to 22?Is there some groundbreaking innovation put into 22 that i didn't know?
They added another 1.
dnf has replaced yum but I'd hardly call that groundbreaking.
Also GDM uses Wayland. No visible difference.
Fedora is in a perpetual state of broken; avoid at all costs.
Nice FUD.Or maybe your kind would prefer the term 'nice meme'?
What have you had problems with?
archfags are retarded
>You're joking right? How is AUR (which is a community repo) safer than a fucking copr/rpm-sphere/whatever?No I am not joking.>Copr is an easy-to-use automatic build system providing a package repository as its output.That doesn't sound safe.I download PKGBUILD from AUR. I examine it and I know exactly what source from where being downloaded and it will be compiled on my machine which I trust.Maybe copr have this functionality too but by searing through web interface, copr doesn't have recipes for all rare software I use every day so I had to make some by myself. I don't want to do that. Same with OpenSUSE's Open Build Service.
What's broken about it?
What's the fucking point of doing all of this if Arch is still insecure as fuark compared to fedora?copr were supposed to be lighweight private repositories without security restrictions and strict guidelines of default fedora repos. kinda what ppas are to ubuntu.
>what is RPM Fusion

Bullshit
Is Fedora used more than OpenSUSE?
>not being a NEETIs it still as much of a fucking pain to acquire third party packages now as it was then? If so, I'll pass.
YesNo, it's as easy as:su -c 'yum localinstall --nogpgcheck http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm'

Quite surprisingly no on distrowatch it's always below opensuse. And memesuse was the worst distro i've ever used.

No, and I'm using luakit on Arch Linux. hue.
> What's the fucking point of doing all of this if Arch is still insecure as fuark compared to fedora?Maybe not adding another possible security hole to existing imperfect collection of software?I know that Arch's "security" strategy "newer = more secure = better" doesn't even close reflect true state of howLinux community works today.But using well tested snapshot of software with strong focus on security and then combining it with something from copr, OBS or PPA doesn't sound more secure than using Arch.> copr were supposed to be lighweight private repositories without security restrictions and strict guidelines of default fedora repos. kinda what ppas are to ubuntu.Well I quit using ubuntu mainly because of security concerns about PPAs.

But you said Fedora was constantly breaking, and could only name SELinux.There are plenty of non-broken distributions that don't ship with it. Surely not using SELinux therefore makes Fedora just as non-broken as these.

What's so special about it compared to other kernels?
Im fine with xubango 15.04
Fedora's kernel is the only one which got its own category in the official kernel.org bugtracker because their maintainers don't suck at packaging the kernel. Others need to build their own vanilla kernel before reporting bugs to upstream.

I just use the server installer. Lets you choose what DE you want (or none) and what package groups to install.
>tfw using Fedora on all my systemsPic related is my new X201
Server netinst doesn't debloat anything. It's literally Anaconda running PID1 and installs the OS in the exact same manner as a live iso. The difference is that you can install many different desktops and a server with a single CD.
>Release notes are actually GNOME 3.16 release notesmeme distro
What about the millions of programs that aren't in rpmfusion? How the fuck do I even make a Copr repo? Fucking RPMs.
No I mean, instead of debloating, use the server install to configure what you want on your system from the get-go. I don't know why they're not just offering a netinst of the workstation variant though.Gnome is devolved on Fedora and red hat more or less funds it. It's practically part of the distro at this point. Compile the one or two obscure packages that you need from source man.
All packages in Fedora are pretty much vanilla upstream. Also has negative sides, such as if upstreamfag can't decide which category application goes, then u gonna get application in fuckshit places https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1220307
I used Fedora from 7 to 12, how much has changed since then?
A lot. I tried Fedora Core around same time and it was buggy pile of shit. Now it's smoother sailing than Ubuntu for me at least since F20 when I jumped over.
>I tried Fedora Core around same timeFedora of old isn't comparable to the new Fedora since 21:https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2015/04/20/fedora-workstation-more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts/

Basically all distros are night and day since that time but Fedora has definitely come a lot further than most
Redhat has been in this business since 90's and calls all shots. Canonical is basing Ubuntu on forked sid/testing Debian. They literally can't do as sensible decisions. All their NIH bullshit just seems to damage them. That is, all the non-upstream non-debian parts. RH is like force of nature, both upstream and downstream simultaneously in perfect harmony.
Is there anyway to install Fedora without GNOME?I don't mean Spins. Just a minimal install, kinda like the Debian net install.
Yeah its called netinstall hurt look at the right side on download page fag
Oh thanksDidn't see it
So is plasma 5 in the repos yet?
Is there any advantage from installing fedora 22 from scratch vs upgrading from 21? Just wondering since I recently started using F21 and I have no useful data on it.
Yeshttps://spins.fedoraproject.org/
>--nogpgcheckSeriously? What the fuck man?
that's the recommended way to install rpmfusion and there aren't really much better ways.signing always needs some initial blind trust. outsourcing that trust to some CA - like publishing the keys on some TLS site or to some WoT - like in some PGP scheme, won't solve it either.case in point most people blindly install their OS from some random ISO and that's more or less the official way.
Some issues:https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Common_F22_bugshttp://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-22-will-contain-fc21-packages/
Just installed this shit and I am already regretting it fonts are just disgusting and I already found two bugs every time I start Nautilus it resets the icons size so I am forever stuck with these gigantic disgusting iconsWhen you click refresh updates in Software, it just gets stuck not doing anything for hours if you let it and you won't be able to install anything else. even after reboot and trying again, it is still the same problem not to mention the usual lack of software support even the free ones which makes you unable to watch your movies or listen to your music without adding some shitty third-party repos which is just unacceptably disgusting.I see fedora shilling a lot on /g/ and every time a new release comes out I always hope it is alright this time but nonot stable, not functional and fucking disgustingnever again
Just look at this diabolical shit
>every time I start Nautilus it resets the icons size so I am forever stuck with these gigantic disgusting iconssounds more like you fail at using Gnome. you need to tell nautilus to save those new icon sizes as default>not to mention the usual lack of software support even the free ones which makes you unable to watch your movies or listen to your music without adding some shitty third-party repos which is just unacceptably disgusting.retard pls. that's because of US software patents and no Red Hat doesn't want to get sued into oblivion and can't pull the 'we are poor anyway' card like some hobby distro or incorporate into some tax-heaven like Canonical.
I like it :)
Considered giving Gnome 3 another chance with this. I'll see how that goes.

You love your wife and don't get off to the thought of a group of basketball americans trotting her globe.
Because even fucking Unstable doesn't have the latest version of Cinnamon. It's been in experimental for months. Fedora can be just as minimal and is FOSS OOTB if you have hardware with open-sores drivers. If not your wifi will still work without hassle.Also you wont have to deal with retarded decisions like the whole ffmpeg->libav switch.
Is that what happened to Debra and they got divorced?Why did they split anyway?
>Also you wont have to deal with retarded decisions like the whole ffmpeg->libav switch.because neither is in Fedora. great solution.
Again see 
>Also you wont have to deal with retarded decisions like the whole ffmpeg->libav switch.retard pls.no one knows before hand which fork will survive and maintaining both when they use the same names isn't easily possible.the way to get FFmpeg in Debian and Fedora was the same: use some third-party repo. now FFmpeg is even in Debian Sid and since Wheezy they don't care about patents anymore, meanwhile nothing changed for Fedora.
>they don't care about patents anymoreSee, Fedora has to care about patents.

Hey /g/, or rather /mkg/,I've recently picked up two monitors, and realized my laptop screen wont be the main one, so I'm in the market for a Mechanical Keyboard. I'm looking for one of those compact boards, without directional and number pad. I'd also like if it was wireless but also able to be connected for muh frames.Basically pic related, what do you call this style and what is one that I could like. Is the small style of these keyboards comfortable? I've got a 25 cm handspan, so I'm far from manlet
They can't be wireless.Even if they're not mechanical, wireless keyboards get terrible lag.What you're looking for is called a 60% keyboard. You should check out Pokers, V60, and happy hacking if you're into topre.
I've never used a mechanical before and I just ordered a pok3r with brownshow bad did I fuck up?
You'll probably be fine.Though, I would have gone with MX Clears for sure

/g/, how do you feel knowing that the DPRK has created an is which combines the visual elegance of apple with a Linux base?
Not knowing about elementary OS. You're stealing fromthem though for not donating to them.
i know you aren't my personal tech support, but I cant find this information dumbed down enough for me anywhere else. So i'm installing arch linux and i followed this indian fucks guide http://www.linuxveda.com/2015/04/20/arch-linux-tutorial-manual/13/So at that point ive rebooted it, and i go to install that shit and bam error because i dont have a connection. my wireless wlp2s3 connection magically dissapears everytime on reboot. ive reinstalled this shit 3 times now, and each time i have a connection till i reboot. god fucking help me, id like to just give up and go for something simpler but i cant at this point.
>i'm installing arch linuxstopped reading there, you already fucked up
just use EVO/lution installer
if im having trouble with this shit theres no way i could do gentoo.
stop besmirching Lain with your retardation, OP
gotta start somewhere
The only person you're fooling is yourself.  Install a non timesink distro, like ubuntu or anything based off of it.  Unless you want to wanted to waste time in the first place.

got a 290 the other month, so not me
DON'T GIVE UP HOPE YOU SHITSZEN AND ARCTIC ISLANDS IN 2016/17, WHIP YOUR CHODEY BONERS OUT AND BLOW A FAT ELECTRIC LOAD OVER THOSE
Waiting mainly on the 380. If they managed to reduce the heat and power consumption I'll get it if not I'm just going to get an old card from eBay.
yeah get a nice old burnt out hawaii card from eBay lmaoCopped me a $250 (after $20 MIR and selling the DIRT Rally code for $20) r9 290x with one of the best aftermarket coolers, idles at 33 and runs full load @ 73. Enjoy your $399 8gb moderately overclocked rebranded r9 290x in 2 months.
I'm more than okay with waiting for Zen because my Phenom II is still alive and kicking, but I've got a much longer tenure with my GPU. I don't think I can wait till 2016 even if it is Q1.
Thanks nvidia for once again ruining the graphics card market
Planned on getting a new AMD card, but after this piss I'll probably just get a 980 Ti
>everything but the 390x is a fucking rebrand>390x is $850Jesus, being serious here, pretty spooked for amd
If the price is not competitive the price goes down. Even if that means they'll be running at a loss, just to keep their market share.Hardware is fairly objective (even if /g/ sometimes try to tell you otherwise) if their benchmarks don't justify the price people don't buy it.
>nvidia rebrands the same cards for several series>NVIDIA A BEST I LOVE YOU NVIDIA LET ME GOBBLE YOUR COCK>amd rebrands cards for one series>AMD IS DEAD RIP RIP RIP
Nobody ever said the 390x is $850 dollars that's the rumor price of the new fuji gpu with hbm

Just buy the 970 you fuck. Or the R9 290X/290.
Who cares, AMD have no drivers anywayOwn more than one AMD card? Good luck ever using it in new releases.
So was Kepler kek. 600, 700 and 800 (OEM only) series.And so was Fermi; 400, 500, and some 600 series mobile GPUs.OH, but wait theres more, how many times did Tesla get rebranded:  8000 series, 9000 series, 200 series and the OEM only 300 series. Lel.
b-but muh directx 12 performance increase
>unironcally recommending 3.5gb or a driverless powerdraining housefire
Tesla is not a rebrand for 200 series200 series is different architecture, you know?GT200 is different from G80/G92GT215/216/218 supported DX10.1, again different from GF8/GF9 seriesYou don't even know wtf you're talking about
It's either that or suck it up and enjoy whatever you have now.
truly the worst of times
>supports a new memory type and has a superior memory controller>must be a rebrandNvidia users are fucking stupid
To be fair, though. Buying something expensive as fuck like a 980 isn't that unreasonable if you don't upgrade your graphics card often. I upgrade mine every 5-6 years and so far I've bought only GTX460/GTX960/HD5770 kind of performance. With a 600 dollar card, that's ~100 dollars a year.
New Hawaii's will be 10% faster than the old ones, how is that any difference in performance compared to GK210 > GM204
>expecting 6 years durability from a card of company that purposely cripples it's older cards
They can't cripple card performance. If the card does 100 FPS in 2015, it will do 100 FPS in 2021 in the same game.
It's already happening with Kepler.
>Is it on a new process node?So Maxwell is a rebrand too then?
>what is gameworksI thought it was solely to fuck over AMD users but it looks like they want you to upgrade that flagship every year.
Did you read what I said, though? A new game having poor performance with bells and whistles enabled using an old card is expected.They can't change the performance of the card, they can only make the games more demanding or differently optimized.
if these speculative rumors are true about the entire lineup being rebrands, then I'm going to stick with my 7870 tahitis until real change happens, I'm sick of them putting the same old architectures out and just slapping a new number on them, I know Nvidia does this too, but this is horseshit, this is why video card innovation died when the buyouts happened, now we're stuck with a shitty duopoly with nothing to show for except incremental improvements for a higher asking price, fuck this shit
Yet any GameWorks games that release a year later, where you would've been 80fps if it had no GameWorks, you're gonna have to put up with a shitty 50fps because Nvidia wont optimize for your older card because they expect you to shell out money every year for them.
Was until the 4gb and $800 price tag.Now I don't know what to spend my money on, don't want another cuck card so it's 980 or 980ti, both are pretty unappealing.Or just get 2 970 cucks and kill myself.
Yea, well don't buy gameworks games and maybe people will stop putting that shit into their games.
>those babbies will never even get why they even have to pay more once the monopoly is established.
>Even if that means they'll be running at a loss,By the looks of their last financial year I don't think they can afford to sell these at a loss. I'm pretty sure if zen and fiji flop, even moderately AMD is going under.Sad times ahead bois
People are fucking stupid though, you tell them "DON'T DO X FOR REASON X, HERE ARE ALL THE FACTS AND INFORMATION, DON'T DO IT!" but they go and do it anyway expecting something completely different despite all of the advice given before hand, look at all the people buying GTX 970s for fuck sake.
>look at all the people buying GTX 970s for fuck sake.I've seen people on multiple boards recommend buying the 970 because "it's still good even if it's not what they advertised)
Because that's true.
>implying normies read any of that shit
There is nothing wrong with the 970 performance, though. Even if nvidia are colossal dicks when it comes to false advertising.Saying "I don't want to buy nvidia product because they are evil dicks" is fine, but there is nothing really wrong with the card. It works.
That's not a good reason to keep buying them.You're literally telling them that it's OK to pull that shit
Every corporation engaged in anti-consumerism at some point. If you want to punish them all you'll end up buying nothing.
Who gives a fuck. Companies are supposed to do what's profitable, not necessarily what's moral.
But in this case you have a chance to make an actual difference. The 290X is better value for money. And by buying one you don't encourage Nvidia's anti consumer crap.
That's horsehitCompanies stop making money if you stop giving it to them.And making money is their main goal.In capitalism you vote with your money
>microstuttering intensifies
how is it better value if its performance is literally gimped in games shilled by nvidia?
Dunno about you mate, but I don't want a 290X.
Nvidia has like 70% dgpu market share at this point. So no, you won't make any difference.
How is it everyone else on /g/'s responsibility to stand up for the people who bought 970s?
im rocking a e8400, asus p5w dh and a gtx460any upgrayedd will not be 390 just because its the next thingif amd get it together then yes, 390, if not nvidia 980

At this point, desktop PCs are a dying market. Qualcomm and Samsung will still be around to compete with Nvidia in the mobile sector.
when will we finally get an alternative to nvidia and amd
fucking never
you already have, its call intel and its shit
Intel Iris Pro
Anyone who buys Nvidia is giving them even more of a reason to put gameworks into games. The more marketshare nvidia has, the more likely devs will shovel that shite into their games thinking that the majority will be pleased regardless of how it affects the minority.
So you'll always be playing 2015 games?
No, but I'm currently playing 2015 games with a 2010 card. Works alright. I do want to replace it, but performance is the third in importance for my reasons to do so.
Intel are fine for mobile devices at tablet sizes too.
Nvidia rebranded Tesla three times straight for their mainstream cards, not for their OEM cards like AMD
I decided to stop waiting and just get a 980 next Friday.
That's why you have to stick with the lesser of the two evils.Everything bad coming from AMD recently is down to bad long term business decisions which they've paid for with their wallet and are about to turn around, everything bad coming from Nvidia is down to sheer greed and monopolization.I know which company is more likely to jew me over, and it's certainly not AMD.
We'll see how Iris Pro 7200 (or whatever it's called) turns out. Intel has a lot of potential to do really cool stuff with their graphics, simply because it's integrated with cpu. Things nvidia and amd can't do without introducing proprietary gimmicks like nvlink.
Thing it's not an old card, and a much slower card in every aspect beats itA 960 beats a 780ti in Witcher 3, that's bullshit and everyone knows it
Some people have been waiting for 300 series for 5 months now. Fuckin idiots
>Nvidia>mobilekekAMD already did it, the APU's are working fineIntel has been trying into graphics since the late 90's, with the massive flop that was the i740, then Labarree that became a HPC coprocessor instead of a GPU, and finally did something acceptable starting with the second gen of HD graphics, and then made something slightly better but retardedly power hungry and expensive with Iris Pro
That's the 390x

Isn't wccf tech almost always at least partially wrong?
Hope you love paying 5x as much for your nvidia cards. Monopoly at its finest retard.
No it doesn't. I've seen Witcher 3 benchmarks and the 780Ti stomps the 960.
I think the 4gb 380x is going to be a good value
About hardware but what do you expect when following a bunch of shitty rumors we really wont know anything until computex or e3
>wccf techNot even oncehttps://vip.asus.com/forum/topic.aspx?board_id=9&model=R9000X-DC3-16GHB&SLanguage=en-us
>200 series is different architecture, you know?Geforce 260 was a rebrand of the Geforce 9800 which was a rebrand of the Geforce 8800. The OEM only Geforce 150 was also a 9800 rebrand.That's FOUR cards that all used the G92 chip; 3 of them being mainstream and one being OEM.
Thanks Nvidia, you're my greatest ally
>tfw waiting for the 300-series>tfw watching 200-series prices steadily rise over the last 3 monthsGetting nervous. When are they supposed to finally announce these fucking things?
series? no I'm waiting for the one and only actually new cardmight be too expensive for me though and there is no cut down version just shitty rebrandsI'm not paying TITAN prices
The 2xx is not a single chip.
that directed me to nothing, what was it supposed to be?
The same amount of evidence wccf tech has. They're taking the fact they don't hit an error page to mean the card exists.
>Geforce 260 was a rebrand of the Geforce 9800This is false.
got it, thanks for clarifying
He probably meant to say 970. The 960 shit stomps the 780 though lel
I gotta ask/wonder. From what little information we have on them thus far, is it looking like the 980ti or the 390x is going to be the card to go for?  I hope to build I new rig soonish, but I want a card that will last for a decent amount of time. Right now I'm thinking it would be the 980ti, I can't imagine 4gb of vram will be enough for 2016s biggest titles.
780 has slightly higher performance than 960 in TW3 if benchmarks are to be believed.
>rebrand a rebrand
>From what little information we have on them thus far, is it looking like the 980ti or the 390x is going to be the card to go for?390X.From what we know, the 980ti is a cut-down TitanX. From leaked benchmarks, the 390x already shits over the TitanX.Of course, nothing it final until both products are released. TitanX is due in a week or so, is it not?..While AMD are announcing the 300 series at some upcoming tech show or another, some time in the next month.
The initial release of the 390x is only 4gb though? Nobody knows when the larger versions will be out, the card can bench mark better than a titanx, but it's limited by the vram amount, right?
Hold off on both cards until a month after they're released.980ti is going to have 6GB apparently, but wait to make absolutely sure they don't pull the same shit they did with the 970. I wouldn't be surprised since it's a cutdown Titan X like the 970 is a cutdown 980.For the 390X/Whatever the fuck Fiji is going to be called, wait for general benchmarks since we know fuck all for certain with all the rumors.>The initial release of the 390x is only 4gb though?Rumors point towards that but I can't see why AMD would use 4GB for their flagship even with HBM. I still believe they're going to use a dual-link interposer because 4GB for the premier model doesn't make sense unless they've got a 8GB model around the corner.Unless they're not targeting 4K which wouldn't make any sense at all.
i have a 7870 and i'm not sure if i'll upgrade it. the hbm one might be buggy and will only have 4gb. man this fucking sucks
>The initial release of the 390x is only 4gb though?From "Leaked" "sources", aka, rumor mills.While HBM1 can only handle 1GB stacks, we have seen nothing to say that the 390X cannot have 8 stacks, thus 8GB of HBM.We really do not know yet.We might see some a special 390X version released specifically for VR environments, this may be a 390X refresh in 2016 with HBM2, or it could be the 8GB variant we seek to see.No one but AMD knows yet.While the 4GB does mean the card would struggle at 4K, it does not mean it is incapable, look at current generation cards, the 290X is capable of 4K, as is the 980. Hell, even the 970 can run 4K.We've yet to see how this new memory technology and GPU perform together outside of what could very well be fake benchmarks, but if the GPU is capable, then we could see something interesting.One analogy I seen here the other day, went a little like this.>You have 2 cars. And a number of passengers to move.>Car A can carry 8 at a time.>While Car B can only carry 4.>Car B can travel 50% faster though.>Both cars finish delivering the passengers at roughly the same timeIt's not exact or as well written with the ideas thrown in, but it gets the point across.
>amdhttp://www.guru3d.com/news-story/amd-radeon-r9-390r9-380r9-370-and-r9-360-series-rebrands.html
I thought the Fiji XT is a new card and it will be the 390xeverything below that tier will be rebrands
The 390x will have neither fiji nor hbmIt wasn't even worth the time I spent reading the rumors up til now
It would be a safe bet to say the 380 through to 360 are rebrands.The 380X could be what we know as the 290X, but with the DCC we see in the R9 285. This could give it a nice performance bump.390 and 390X are most likely the only new chips we will see. There is a rumor that some of the lower end stuff will also be new, like the 340.
why, because now all the rumors point to rebrands so you nvidiafags can have some ammunition for shit flinging contests?  fuck off
>It wasn't even worth the time I spent reading the rumors up til nowAMD needs to either keep their cards closer or fucking dispel these rampant rumors next time. The hype buildup always ends up in disappointment when left unchecked. This shit is only hurting them. Unless they actually do deliver.
AMD is marketing this poorly for sure. People are going to read these rebrand articles and just buy a new Nvidia card which releases products quickly and relatively transparent on the production line up>arbitrarily waiting for dates to unveilIf the product is fucking done, release the stats and specs, officially to remove any 3rd party shilling. Then show a physical demo of it once you get to your shitty video game show
>AMD is marketing this poorlyThey aren't even marketting it.Which is the problem.Though I can expect Lisa Su to get up on a stage, card in hand. Do a live demo, then when asked about the rumors by someone in the audience, just turn and say>Grow up. Only children listen to, even believe rumors.
thisIt'll have DX12 support, lower temps, lower power usage, and slightly more power. I've just finished my build and still don't have a GPU in it and I've been using Intel 4600 to play some CS:GO and USFIV. I'm hoping the 380X will be solid card so I can get it for Bamham
yeah, but what arch?  full Tonga?
your 380 is the r9 285...
So today we all learned that all GPUs made with the same process are rebrands. That means GM200 is a rebrand of GM204, which is a rebrand of GK204, which is a rebrand of Tahiti, which is a rebrand of Hawaii, all of which are rebrands of the new Fiji.
All we see is more and more expensive flagship cards while the mid range cards are just rebrands or at least so gimped that they can't even beat their predecessors.
to be fair, 1000$ cards have been out for a while now, but it is heading in that direction
you mean is it a different architechture. You could have the exact architecture shrunk and scaled down to a smaller node which would reduce power consumption and improve efficiency.A lot of the architecture is often reused and more logical blocks are added such that you make use of that extra space you've got on the die when you go to a smaller node.Why reinvent the wheel every time.
The 200 series was not a different architecture, you retard. It was still based on Tesla, the exact same architecture used since the 8800 series. They just made new larger chips based on that same architecture, just like AMD did by introducing Hawaii on the R9 200 series."GF" was Fermi, "GK" was Kepler and "GM" is Maxwell. What the hell do you think the "T" in "GT" means, you idiot?
Anyone got a price estimate range for this line through the old crystal ball? backed by past purchase history of course.
>AMD is marketing this poorly for sureThey did absolutely no marketing on this. The stupid websites are just speculating
Is AMD winning yet?
I'm surprised that the Titan X wasn't more expensive than the Titan Z but "only" 1000 like the original.
>AMD is marketing this poorly for sure.They have literally said nothing about the r9 3xx series
>They have literally said nothing about the r9 3xx seriesThey said some stuff during their Financial Analyst Day.Mostly about HBM and Mantle, Dx12, Vulkan etc.
they did say they would have new graphics products this year
Just to be clear, they didn't even mention the 300 series. For all we know their non-OEM cards could be the 400 series.It's fucking retarded how news outlets are making clickbait articles.
because as mentioned earlier, its all clickbait, AMD has been very tight lipped about the new products, everyone thinks this Asus product lineup is some major leak when all they are are product numbers, no other information given
No marketing is the problem.
Planning on getting two Fiji XT cards and putting them on water pending performance results.  Expecting my loop to raise like 10 degrees.
they fired their marketinf department to save money, you think they're gonna spend more money hiring a firm to hype up products that aren't even out yet when they're already strapped for cash?
Well they have said a few things, but most of the shit you see in this thread is rumors. Could be true, could be not true. What we know can be found in this slide. And if Q2 ends on june 21 the card will have to be released by then.
>not trueuntrue is the word I was thinking of :^)
>differentiatedthe fucks that supposed to mean?  are they differentiatrd from the previous models?  if so how?  is it just the model number but they use the same arches as last year?  WTF?!?!?!
No clue Computex is only a week away and that's when some think AMD will release more information.
I bought a [spoiler]960[/spoiler], might step up to a ti. I'm most likely going to get a 390/390X the next upgrade cycle however, unless HBM turns out to be a complete flop.
well I'm sorry but that's completely unacceptable, your answer is unacceptable sir!
why are people throwing around HBM so much when it's only on a single turbo-enthusiast tier card?anyway i wanted to get a 390 but i'll probably just wait for pascalDo we know anything about when pascal will launch? besides "2016"should have got a 280x, trumps the 960 all day any day. and i'm an nvidia guyanyway by the time you NEED to upgrade from the 960 pascal will probably be out, and it's supposedly going to have gen 2 HBM
would be nice if the gooks got their shit together and released info on the Samsung UE850 Literally like 4 months behind schedule
pascal = 2nd half of 2016
>Do we know anything about when pascal will launch? besides "2016"Q2 2016 I think I read somewhere.But Pascal being fabbed with TSMC, I think we can expect several delays.
Depends if you are happy waiting more than a year for this.
I usually try to hold out as much as possible without sacrificing too much before upgrading Video Cards.Went from a single X1950, to Xfire X1950s, then a 4870x2 and now a 7970.Ill try to keep the 7970 going as long as possible, unless 4k Monitors come down by a lot in the near future.
Really hope it's Q2 2016, would probably be the perfect time to upgrade
980 should drop in price. get dat. or the 290x. calm down guy
get another to crossfire, I have 2 7870 Mysts and they scream 2-7970s would be better
>being fabbed with TSMCWhy don't they go with superior samsung/glofo?
should I just add another 290 to my rig or sell the current card and buy a 390x when it comes out? I'd have to spend 550 more even after selling the card but would the lower heat and better driver support be worth it?
I got a 7950 and it's still going strong.7000 series is fucking awesome.Buddy of mine with a 7870 is still going fine too, granted he often needs to turn down or off AA and post effects, but that's to be expected to be fair. That was sometimes the case even when the card was newly released.
My psu is too shitty to handle the 280x, and I probably wouldn't notice a huge difference on 1050p. And who knows, the 390X might actually be relatively cheap by the time Pascal comes out because nvidia sure as hell can't into competitive pricing.
It will be Q3 minimal, anyone saying otherwise is way too optimistic. Even TMSC knows how shitty their 16nm ff+ production is going.
>My psu is too shitty to handle the 280xWhat psu? If you think it can handle a 960, it can probably handle a 280x tbh.
why the fug are they using tmsc
No idea.No doubt some business deals going on.I honestly feel sorry for nVidia.AMD were late to so many product releases because of TSMC fucking up.
A CX430, the 960 barely squeezes in there. Gonna go with a Seasonic 550 or 620 next cycle.
since the rumor that the fiji chips will introduce a category of their own is starting to make some sense, what do you guys that amd will it?given their track record, I'm pretty sure they'll go with somethng like Zeus (titan - chronos killer) -- well olympus is already taken and I doubt they'd go with God.Place your bets on w/e idiotic name it'll be given.
*what do you guys think that amd will name it
Anyone got proof that the R9 300 consumer series will be rebrands?>NB4 someone posting R9 300 OEM series.
>Anyone got proof that the R9 300 consumer series will be rebrands?No. Because there is none. It's all speculation so far.The most likely scenario is this ()
it can easily handle a 280x...
You should add that the car with 4 passenger uses more or less the same power as the 8 passenger one for both trips.
I don't hate AMD because it's cheaper, but if they don't stop with all the re-rebrand and the OC, AMD will need water cooling system in all the series...my tri-x will not go higher...
Why does Sapphire advertise it as requiring 750w? Seemed more than a bit overstated to me but I doubt a 430w is going to fall into a safe margin there.
14nm should allow for more oc :^)
Because noname brand psus that can't even handle half their specified wattage. If you don't have a super power hunger cpu, you can  handle a 280x. Just add the TDP of your GPU and GPU(s) together and add about 30W to get the absolute maximal power you will ever draw. If your psu isn't shit and it has more wattage, its fine.
Well it wasn't the dealbreaker tbh, but I guess I'll keep that in mind for the 300 series.
I wouldn't run a 280X on a CX430. Specially if it's one of the older revisions. That's a group regulated PSU and the 280X is massively power hungry. You're really playing with fire if you try to run a 280X on a 430W bottom of the barrel PSU.
>HD7970 OC = HD7950 moded bios = HD7970 GHz Edition = R9 280X = R9 380X
380x will be Tonga.
>R9 380X = R9 280XI seriously hope this doesn't happen, maybe if they sell it at $150 it could be acceptable, but fucking hell, I don't think they'd do that, no fucking way.It better fucking be, I'd like a 15% faster R9 285 with an extra 2GB of vram.
>http://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-r9-390x-hawaii-8-gb-gddr5-spotted-radeon-r9-380-tonga-r9-370-pitcairn-rebrands/The best comment>Rebrands suck indeed, because we gamers want new stuff. But let's be honest, was it really necessary to develop completely new GPUs from AMD's point of view? To compete against what? Maxwell? LOL It's one of the post pathetic new gens I remember.>The GTX 780ti was about 5-10% faster than 290X untill the 900 series has been released. Now Kepler is almost no competition anymore and the GTX980 is only 10-15% faster than 290X. That's current gen vs. last gen. No sane person would upgrade from a 290 or 780 for such a ridiculous performance gain. So what do you guys actually expect? A new 20-30% faster AMD GPU placed against the 980? And another one vs. Titan X?>What about the rest of Maxwell? The gimped feature card 970 not being faster than 290X. Nv has actually no counterpart against the 290. It's much cheaper than a 970 offering only 5% less performance but real 4GB lol>The GTX960? A true Nvidia peasant card. A $269 Tonga XT 4GB could become a real bestseller, it will clearly outperform the GTX960 and $200-250 is what most gamers pay for a graphics card. Fanboys should finally realize that Nvidia has NOTHING to offer between $200-350, this is ridiculous. I guess Nvidia will release a super gimped GM204 to compete with Tonga XT, a true 3GB 224bit GM204 garbage that they couldn't use for GTX970/980.>And then we should not forget that real DX12 engines are not there yet. As we see GCN is a future-proof GPU design, I believe that GCN will benefit from DX12 more than Maxwell. Asynchronous compute engines (2011 Tahiti already had 2 ACEs) will finally become important and who knows, maybe a 290X will perform like a 980 then. Anyway it looks like AMD needs only 1 GPU to compete against 2 Nvidia gens ;D
Can any  card that costs less than $300 run witcher 3 on high/ultra @ 1080p? I was gonna get a 970 but I might just hold out with a medium power card with a new generation around the corner
>Nv has actually no counterpart against the 290. It's much cheaper than a 970 offeringCrockshit lol
I keep saying it, and that retard keeps bringing up the mobile chip, but a full Tonga with 4GB VRAM would be worthy to upgrade to

Can someone explain to me Memory Interface Width? the 970 is 256 bit and the AMD is higher, what is up with that, I'm guessing it helps with textures and aa?
Well its true. 290x have more or less performance to the GTX970 for years old card except it uses more power but having 500MB more RAM.280x can compete with GTX960.The only thing AMD can't compete is the GTX980.
>still linking clickbait speculation
It helps with memory bandwidth. It has no implications on real world performance when comparing two vastly different architectures.Eg Amd and nvidia.

Give me one reason why I shouldn't buy a GTX 980 next week.I have a budget up to its price, no more.What would a 290x offer?Why should I wait for a Maxwell successor?
Wait for the 980ti and the 300 series to come out, it'll be sub $500 thenif you can get a 980 for $450~ you absolutely should, amazing card at that priceespecially if you can get it for sub $500 and get the free witcher 3/bamham codes

*memes**AMDshills*
I bought a GTX 980 about 10 days ago to play Witcher 3, and I returned it today for a refund.Planning on getting a 980 Ti or if the new high AMD card performs up there
Thats what I want it forIs it not cutting it? I want no concessions. Dont need supersampling, but need everything else.
Eh? 980ti already releasing that soon? Last time I heard it was september.
>tfw EVGA 90 day step up plan just expired for my 980 last weekfuck me. Making the jump to 1440p soon and I want the 980ti
last I heard it was supposed to be mid may. They'll without a  doubt release it around the 300 series launch, and the 300 series comes out next month
>What would a 290x offer?95% of the 980's performance for only 2/3 of the price
Leaked specs and benches already, some of them says a launch next week alreadyIt's a very good card but it's not worth getting when 980 Ti/390x and price cuts on old cards are right around he corner
>290XIt offers nothing but HOUSEFIRES
and 90% less drivers

>has no rebuttal>just posts reaction imagekek hows that butt amdfag?>25% market share
>Ngreedia>price cutsYeah right. If they actually lower the price of the 980 I'll eat a whole bag of sugarless haribo gummy bears.
They aren't going to lower them it would just make people less inclined to buy a 980ti  and they want to see this new card
If you're not tied to Nvidia, wait for the 300 series to see how it works
You were going to do that anyway you fat fuck.
Why would anyone respond to shitposting with anything other than shitposting?
There is no reason not to. I prefer AMD but the 980 is the best card out there for the price. The only thing better would be a 295x2, if you have an extra hundred to spend.
>What would a 290x offer?Close performance, but cheaper. Also Nvidia won't be able to gimp the performance via gaymenwerks when Pascal comes out.
295x2 is a piece of shit that pulls 16 lightbulbs of power out the wall
Piece of shit that out performs everything on the market.
I just got myself an R9 290X.I'm honestly not particularly impressed. If I didn't get it from a friend really cheap (less than half the price), I would've returned it.
It gets raped by a titanx, and a titanx isn't some nasty two cards slapped together with a water cooler that consuming a massive amount of electricity
>980Ti and R9 3XX series coming next month, allegedly.seems like good enough reason to wait to me.
You can buy a 295x2 for about the same price of a 980. Maybe $10-20 more.The Titan X gets raped by the 295x2. What are you on about?
>You can buy a 295x2 for about the same price of a 980. Maybe $10-20 more.What the *FUCK* are you smoking?
>If I didn't get it from a friend really cheap (less than half the priceShit, now that is a deal.
Not the same anon, but this is the pricing here in the UK.Honestly, not terrible considering the performance jump.But yeh, the cheapest 980 compared to the cheapest R9 295x2 is easily a £100 difference.
I'm like, whatever'ing so hard right now, I want to see this $550 R9 295X2, so fuck off.
At TigerDirect it's $630. You can make a new account for 10% off your first order and get free shipping, so that brings the price down to $567. That's only $17 more than the regular price of a 980. There's also a $30 rebate but fuck those things.
How well does a 960 play with linux? Any of you have any issues? does it work ootb?I hear people have a lot of issues with ATI
Fine.Fuck you.Here.Now, granted, the anon to whom you originally replied never said WHICH 980 is was $10 more than. But this is not the point.While the 295x2 is more expensive than most 980's, it wrecks it in performance, the gap in performance an price makes it a steal all things considered.
No duh it wrecks it a 980 is only marginally faster than a 290X and the 295x2 is Two 290X's on the same board
Because HBM will cause the jump in power to be much bigger than in previous generations.
HBM doesn't do much on its own other than allow for more shader ALUs to be fed, and we've already roughly reached the power limit for max shaders with 28 nm TSMC chips short of water cooling (hurray new AMD not-R9-390X). There's no real latency improvement, there's maybe a power savings in the low 10s of Watts, and even the 290X wasn't constrained as much by GDDR5 bandwidth as by small L2$ and questionable GPGPU design decisions.HBM is more the necessity of 2016 GPUs built on 14nm lithography with 6k+ shader ALUs.

iPhone 5 here.Battery dies in 2 hours.Battery is expanding.The expansion made the screen pop off from the phone itself. I can see inside the fucking phone.I'm waiting for the Xperia z4 compact or z3+ compact. Whatever comes first.
How can apple be superior when my fucking phone crashes when some asshole sends me a fucknig text?Explain that faggot!
Not him but I'd rather get laughed by fat neck bearded Linux/android losers like you than normal non autistic woman
Get out iCultists!
can anybody explain how to fix this?
If you actually letcApple know via techt support, then they can help you fix it. The problem could be anything.
the problem is fags being fags and sending malicious texts
That string of arabic characters crashed iOS6 and OS X devices using Apple's text renderers.
LOOK HERE NIGGERS FOR FIX!Just got off from support:Step 1: BLOCK THE SENDER(S). I don't care if their your friends, block them so they don't make it worse!Step 2: Click on your Photos app.Step 3: Send any picture to the person that sent you the malicious message last. This can be done by:Tap a pictureTap the square at the bottom left of the screenTap the Message buttonEnter in the contact name of the last sender4: You should be able to access the message app. Once you do that DELETE ALL TEXT THREADS CONTAINING THE MESSAGES. ALL OF THEM5: Boom! All fixed.Nothing you can do really to prevent other people from crashing your device while it's locked though, that part is up to Apple for creating an update to solve it!Hope it is fixed!
I bought a Raspberry Pi 2 and haven't really found too many great applications and games.  Also encountered some error setting up RetroPie so its sitting here like a brick.

Yes, it is

>Until Linux gets it's collective community shit together and offers gaming support as well as a better alternative to WINE. It will never be popular, ever in a million years.Are you actually implying that most people choose Windows over Linux because of gaming? You know how diminshingly small the PC gaming market is, right?
The entire desktop market, in fact. Consider that Android is based on Linux and it's easy to see where it places compared to windurrs

lol Linux......hacker wannabe os.
He's right though, why do Loonixfags get so butthurt about this? Linux gaming is awful, even with Vulkan drivers, they'll always be a step behind.
As a Linux fanboy, windows for work with cad or media is perfectly reasonable
>Linux sounds interesting, can I do X on it?>lol fucking retard, X is dumb and you're dumb too if you like it. The only reason why Linux can't do it properly is because it's not important, lolYup, that'll teach them. What a great example of the friendly and grown-up linux-community.

Linux is basically a "OSX DIY" kit, there is no real reason to use Linux if you can afford a Mac.
Because I like the laser eyes.
This is 4chan; we don't do friendly or grown up
except for the fact that OSX is a shit OS and macs are insanely over priced for what you get.
I've played a bit with Linux for years, but had it on my laptop for the past two years, and been using it full time on my desktop since January.
it's like choosing the "custom" setup vs the "recommended setup" in windows software.
Linux is a shity version of OSX bro, get your head out of your ass. The only thing Linux has going on for it is it has dircolors built in, and you have to add it on OSX.It's more of a DIY kit than a "custom" setup. Having a machine where all the drivers are specifically designed for that machine is something Linux users will never know.If you want to go... "custom" in OSX, it's very easy to swap out the Unix tools for GNU tools, put in ZSH shell instead of Bash Shell ect..
>Linux is a shity version of OSX brostopped reading right there; idk if you're trolling or a typical macfag but either way you're full of shit
It just is bro, please prove me wrong. I'd love to discover some hidden advantage Linux has to running OSX.I literally have to choose between a Linux and OSX machine at work with in the next week, and can't justify getting anything Linux related for doing real actual work.

Since when does "excessive hand-holding" make me less competent? I'm busy spending time developing software not fucking wasting 2 hours to get simple shit to work. Unless you ACTUALLY use Linux as a server it's literally shit
I'm writing this post on a ArchLinux box as we speak :) I am guessing you have ubuntu or mint installed and don't know shit about what Linux actually is.What a tremendous faggot. P.S. proper factory configuration is not "hand holding", it just means it works.
Since you need to spend two hours "getting simple shit to work" is what makes you less competent; not your desire for convenience. Embrace your limits, work within them and move on with your life, bra

I was thinking about installing linux , how good is Wine support , every time i hear someone saying it's good and there is no difference in fps for games i imagine linux fanboy speaking to me.
The linux community reminds me a lot of /b/ and /pol/ this
Haven't used a windows machine in years. OSX is really the only OSX any professional would ever need.
>uses hipster non ironicallyfucking retard
The linux community seems worse to me./pol/ Makes some attempt convert you to their view.The linux community does everything it can to discourage beginners from switching.
You don't to pick Linux or Windows. Use Windows for games and linux for whatever you need it for. VmWare and it's kind can run one inside the other all you want so you don't even have to log out of one to boot into the other.
I'd still prefer dual boot , are you sure virtual machines can work that smoothly that I won't be able to spot difference while working in it?
I have to agree. I do think the Arch community is the best out of all of them though. I have gotten legitimate help in-between jeering and general aspergery behavior. Even though I am a pretty big Mac Fag and find the Mac community to be extremely helpful when getting into the Unix aspects of OSX.... Microsoft products have above and beyond the best community for any software developer or other IT professional.
>Are you sure virtual machines can work that smoothly that I won't be able to spot difference while working in it?From personal experience using Windows as the OS and linux running in a VM I'd say yeah, pretty much. Note of course, that the two will be sharing resources so take care if you only have limited RAM
I don't care if it's popular I care if it's better.The more obscure it is the more people there are I can feel superior to.
Thanks for help
Game support has literally nothing to do with the Linux community, that responsibility rests SOLELY on game developers. Tell the developers of whatever faggoty game you play to port it.
Because Linux is shit for command line fetishists, it's community is neckbeard fags and 
Do you have a job? If you do, I'm sure you use a real OS such as Windows or OSX if you're a design faggot. The corporate world doesn't want to type shit into a console to get things done, and neither do normal people. It's 2015 mate, stop being a faggot. The closest Linux will ever get to being mainstream is Android.Linux is literally only good for inexpensive web servers, nothing else. It's shit, deal with it.
I am using Linux but I have to admit that video editing and sound editing on Linux is a pain in the ass.And I have tried a lot of linux software here..
Linux is the best OS.
>We
Nothing can beat GNU/Linux and *BSD when you work with Juniper hardware all day.I think people on /g/ just have a bad case of baby-duck syndrome and are incapable of learning anything new, and since GNU/Linux is an OS for people who are actually enthusiastic about using their computer to it's full potential, it requires learning and dedication to master the OS.

Actually, that permission denied message means that you can't execute that file. Really, you can't execute a copyright file. You should have used cat or something.
Not sure I understand that image.
To all those who said "Muh gaymes"get WINE you faggots, or run a dual OS.Besides, many steam games work on Linux anyway.

This is Yaourt, not Pacman. Yaourt is essentially a wrapper for Pacman that lets you handle some unofficial packages as well.yaourt works with anything installed from the AUR (arch user repository).That said, yaourt is only made for convenience. You can still install anything through pacman (yes, even if you compile it yourself) with very little effort.If you want to change the default configuration for some package (eg, change some config options on official arch's ffmpeg install) then you just grab the PKGFILE that arch uses for ffmpeg (via ABS), Modify the line in the file that lists the config options. Then run makepkg -s on the file and it will make a pacman package that you can install the usual way.So if you want to compile your own stuff altogether then all you need to do is write a simple PKGBUILD file for it and proceed as above.It's actually very simple to do and you can look at the install script from literally any other package out there if you want some examples or references.

I'm sorry but I just don't see this happening in any of our lifetimes. Think of ALL the modifications that would have to be done to the road... The cost of that alone just buries this idea.It's just like in the 40's when they thought we'd all have personal jetpacks by now. It's just not going to happen.Am I wrong?
What road modifications? Google has been sending autonomous cars in traffic for years now
20 years it'll be illegal to drive a car in public
>Think of ALL the modifications that would have to be done to the road...None?>It's just like in the 40's when they thought we'd all have personal jetpacks by now. It's just not going to happenExcept nobody expected this at all until google suddenly came out with working prototypes.So basically the exact opposite of the jetpack thing
Not in civilised countries at least. Here in Romania you can't drive straight for 10 meters before hitting a hole.
No there WILL be modifications that would have to be put in place, such as sensors that can guide the automobile when the lanes are covered in snow or debris.
... that's already a thing where snow is common...
>such as sensors that can guide the automobile when the lanes are covered in snow or debrisThey can already do that on their own as good or better than human drivers
Well, a self-driving car could probably be very good at identifying and avoiding pot-holes.Whether you'd want to do that or not, though, is debatable. It might look like reckless driving and make others very nervous about sharing the road with your car.

That's the plan. It's just I'm on holiday at the moment. I remember buying a laptop in the early half of the 2000s and it had about as much bloat as a Porsche race car.
This is fucking unacceptable. It's been over a year, and there is still no PRACTICAL method for an anon browsing on their ios device to view webms.Surely, one of you on here is enterprising enough to build an app specifically for this purpose. Charge a fucking dollar for it, we'll buy it by the thousands.Yes, there's the webkit bullshit, which means you can't use a web-view method. So make your app take the address, download the file, do some internal bullshit to convert it or something, and play it back (looping by default).
That's what you get for trying to use a shitty mobile device for practical usage.  Mobile sucks and needs to fucking die.

Hey /g/, this is your reminder to backup your data.Thank you.
You're welcome?
Why would I back up my data? I have nothing important to back up. Pictures? I don't care about that. Steam library? I can just download them all again. I have no important work documents either.
So you're worthless?
No, I'm just not some weeb who cares about Muhh anime :(((
Then don't back up thenSome of us use our computers for important stuff
>pictures, vidya saves, and docs all in sync with google drive>movies, games, music, etc. all synced weekly to external HDD via SyncToyI good, maynAlthough I am debating whether or not to backup my music to a service like Google Play Music or iTunes match. Play Music is free but has a worse track record of actually matching songs, plus I've converted my entire lossless library to be 256kb/s iTunes Plus AAC (with iTunes) so having it match to 320kb/s MP3 for some songs would be a bit jarring.On the other hand iTunes match is $25, but I would have everything in the same format whether or not it was matched since 90% of my music is converted from lossless (other 10% is hard to find shit that would just be uploaded as-is to either service)Sort of leaning towards iTunes match at the moment, I wouldn't be too distraught losing my lossless music library if I had iTunes versions readily available.My movies, on the other hand, I have no good solution for. I currently have them duplicated on another HDD, but feel as though that's not enough. 95% of them are my own personal Blu-Ray rips / encodes with hand selected metadata, so that would be an absolute bitch to redo from scratch. Duplication is enough for now, my HDDs are in good health anyway.
But how to backup?
No worries.  My home directory is on a RAID 1.
Cloud storage, DVD-Rs are best for the average person, IMO
Like what?
>wasting disks backing up anime and media that you can just redownloadyou guys aren't seriously doing this right?
External hard drives that are always offline except when backing up. Also consider software that takes images of entire partitions. Saved my ass once when I got a virus my AV just couldn't get rid off.But what if the zombie apocalypse comes and there's no more internet?
Meh.All I'd lose is 15gb of reaction images. Games and animu could be downloaded again, but you gotta wait until those images appear man.
All these deluded anons thinking there will be a stable internet connection after the next big war, which will be a thermonuclear one.

Which SSD would you recommend for gaymin?  My friend told me getting one would drastically improve performance.So far I've been thinking of getting the Intel one because I dig the skull design on it.
get a pcie ssd if you're not poor
another placebo threadenjoy spending your mommy's dollar for nothing
>I dig the skull on itYou're literally the only one.But seriously, it doesn't matterAs long as it's from Intel, Samsung, or Crucial you ought to be fine. They all produce quality SSDs.
850 pro or bust
>bait
Any SSD should do fine.
Crucial MX200 because their name is Crucial
I am kind of poor.  Been seeing some of the 500gb SSDs come down in price so I thought it would be a good time to buy.
>poor>thinking of buying a 500gb ssdright
Intel NVMehttp://m.newegg.com/Product/index?itemnumber=20-167-300Trust me, it's the best, increased my K/D ratio from 1/1 to 21/1 in CS 1.6
Get a 120GB if you're poor, idiot. That's all you need.
SSDs don't do shit for gaming performance, uleh. Only time they're actually useful is for reducing load times, so shit like GTA V is nice.Kingston HyperX Savage are fucking brutal fast for a good price, go pick up a 240/480gb one.Fuck off you retarded memespouting shitlord.
>Improve performanceDoesn't it only improve loading times? Like when you start the game up and it stalls(man) for like 20 seconds, it'll speed that up to like 6s and nothing more. Or general loading screens as well.Hardly seems like it's worth 80$+ when you can just wait an extra 5~10 seconds.
Except 120gb isn't enough when games like GTA V hits 60gb and its not uncommon for them to be around 40gb these days.
It doesn't improve performance for games, only loading times
Here's an idea:Don't give advice unless you know what you're talking about.Fuck off and use an SSD for 5 minutes, then you'll understand.
Most of the performance improvement from an SSD comes from the OS and in loading times. So you'd only get an actual performance boost from installing the OS and the few games that you play that have bad loading screens, like GTA V. You don't need more than 120GB for that shit. More is a luxury.
I've heard it stops the microstutters in mainly open world games when data needs to read off the HDD occasionally.  Don't think it actually increases FPS.  Could be wrong though.
We're talking about games here Anon not overall computer experiences.SSD's wont help increase your graphics and frames Anon, that's what a CPU and GPU are for.
>Fuck off and use an SSD for 5 minutes, then you'll understand.True, but make sure it's an Intel NVMe and you'll really understand
it improves all load times. >Hardly seems like it's worth 80$+ when you can just wait an extra 5~10 seconds.saves time loading everything, not just gaymesboot included. I can cold boot into W7 in 15 seconds
GTA V is like 60 gigs.Of course he needs a bigger drive.
crucial MX100 top quality for low costs
Windows (20GB) + GTAV(60GB) = 80GB.128GB is fine for GTAV and several more games that aren't bloatware.
Yes you fucking do, cunt.120gb SSD owner here with GTA V. Have 8gb of space left on the drive with the bare minimums.Getting a 240gb in a couple weeks, which is the REAL minimum for 2015 not just for space but also for write speed which is pretty much doubled.
Bull fucking shit.Stop spreading your retarded misinformation around.
I was told this was only for games that have heavy demanding shit beyond all fuckery.By that I don't just mean Fallout or anything, but Skyrim with every-fucking-mod-ever-tier.
I heard about people with 120gb drives not being able to install GTA V because during installation it requires 120gb of space for the all the temporary installation files.
Which part didn't you understand?The basic addition?
if someone was poor, then they probably pirated a repack of gtav, which you can't even unpack and install with less than 120 available
No, thats Vram you're thinking of.
Windows is not 20gb, GTA V is 65gb after updates and 120gb is not fine in any way, shape or form for modern gaming.Shut the fuck up unless you know what you're talking about.
It won't improve FPS but it will improve loading times alot
>don't do shit for gaming performance>reducing load timesYou load DURING the game, you mong.There don't exist any games any more that load everything at the beginning.
Ah, cheers for not being a dick like that other guy.>put an SSD in PS4>Bloodborne still takes like 50 secondsI know it doesn't utilize the whole thing but who the fuck coded that shit
PS4 is SATA2.
The 500gb version seems like such a better deal.
>Gaming>SSDIs this a troll thread?Sure the overall system performance and load times will be improved, its a must for nowadays system, but if you expect to get better FPS in game you will be greatly dissapointed anon.
You will get better FPS in games if your hard drive was already slow.Most games (especially ones by Crytek) will stall to a halt if it needs to load something. So your FPS comes crashing down with it. Try it out sometime.
it's a good investmentthe loading times are cut by more than half, but assuming it's just half>booting OS, 70 seconds, 35 seconds on SSD>opening/letting steam finish loading, 20 seconds, 10 secs on SSD, so far 45s saved>opening game, 30 sec, 15 w/ SSD, 60s saved>loading map or joining a server, 30 sec, 15 w/SSD, 75s saved>getting seven 30 sec loading screens in 1-2 hours of play, just 15 sec each with an SSD, 105s saved, 180s total now if you play games, 1 to 3 times a day, for 1 to 2 hours each time, that's anywhere from 180 to 540 seconds saved, when you arrive to that appointment 5 minutes late because you wanted to get that last extra hour of gaming, remember this now lets take one month, 30 days, 30 times 180 to 540 = 5400 to 16200 seconds or,  1.5 to 4.5 hours saved each monthyou might think, we'll this 3~ hours isn't too much, there are like a many hundred hours in a month. But these hours are wasted hours, during them you are not enjoying your games, neither you are working or learning something so you don't get anything from it eitherand that is only for games, if you use your PC for working or doing other stuff then you can save much more time, 5 to 10 hours every month
Shit that reminds me of that website / image about showing how much time in your life you lose by sleeping.
>reduced load times actually improve FPS>oh wait they don'tLe sigh. Stop being a dummy and realize what they meant.@ OPJust get any budget SSD that is worth it's shit. You don't need no XTREME edition shit or samshit pro cause you are PRO! etc.
I got an ssd to help with performing with VST software instruments in real time, it really helps with the latency when playing with really large sample libraries.
Is there a good (Reliable) SSD that's cheapish? I'm looking for a 120gb-240gb to upgrade my X201. Should I just wait until Black Friday?
I would say 256GB or 240GiB~ is much better as you won't really have to worry about space20GB for OS20GB for other software10GB for desktop and documents used frequently, as well as files saved/cache used by programson a 120GB that leaves you with 70GB, where you can only install 5-8 games, or not even 3 if they are newer oneson 240GB one you are left with 190GB more than double the amount of free space after OS and other softwarespecially if you want to futureproof as big  games from now on will easily be 30GB+
i'd get the most xtreme edition you can find. you get what you pay for anon
Kingston HyperX Fury>20gb for OSDon't know where you're getting that bullshit from, try 35-40gb for Win7 64bit.
posted this in the stupid questions thread but will probably get a better answer here:is $178 a good price for a Samsung 850 EVO 500GB or is it likely to drop significantly in a month or so?
it should also be noted that in256  128512  256not just in size, but that the larger version of the same drive will have significantly more spare cells (disproportionately greater) to replace dead ones, giving better lifetime reliability, and impacting performance in some drives.170 is lowest its been going on sale lately, but who knows for the future. probably not any major change in a month, no
Played Crysis 3 from an external usb drive and played just fine
So would it be smarter to just buy a 120gb SSD and then another external/internal SATA?
It is really just user preference. Some people prefer to pay more and store more games/media on their SSD. Other people pay less and store more things on secondary drives.
Before i pull my trigger /g/,Anything i should change or is it good as is?
garbage.just buy a mac.

Overclocking is a waste of time and money. If this is for gaming, don't bother, just get a 4570/4590, a H97 motherboard, and drop the afterarket cooler.There's no point in paying for a Caviar Black when you laready have a SSD for your OS. Get a Blue instead, or Red if you want more reliability.You can get decent cases, like the 200R and 300R, for less than that.Your choice of PSU is ridiculous. This PC will barely pass 300W consumption. Even if you add a second GPU in the future, a 650W one is still more than enough.Unless you live in a tropical/equatorial country, you might as well take the money you're spending on case fans and throw them straight into the garbage, it will be easier.And get a S2340L or P2314H monitor instead.
What is with everyone's font rendering?
Why not an R5?
>You can get decent cases, like the 200R and 300R, for less than that.This. I love my 300R.
not watercooling.i want a quiet and simplistic styled case.
You don't need 850w, a 650w would do.Fractal design fans aren't worth that amount the screws are cheap and they don't push much air.Could go full Noctua for a few more pennies actually.
must be windows
My Mobo has already been bought, have had it for months already.Here is what my list looks like now, 750w psu for SLI.I'd rather not buy a IPS monitor right now.Waiting for 980 ti and 3xx series to come out to pick my card.
Better.But you can still drop the overclocking nonsense.And if you're set on the R4, at least get one without the side window.
yeah, switched to windowless version.overclocking nonsense? you mean the cpu cooler and 4690k?
650w is definitely not enough for a second 290 in the future. 850w is spot on if he plans to get a new card in the future. I had a 750w with my second 290 and I had heaps of issues, so I bought a new one and I was fine.
Yes.If you mean for work, like you need to remove hours from the time it takes you to finish a complex 3D rendering, then it's worth it (but if that's the case, you should also be looking into getting a chip with HT).If this PC is for gaming, overclocking will bring you negligible improvements. Not worth the cost of the K CPU and aftermarket cooler plus the time it will take you to find the most adequante voltage and run stability tests.For context:>http://www.techspot.com/review/1006-the-witcher-3-benchmarks/page5.html>http://www.techspot.com/review/1000-project-cars-benchmarks/page5.html>http://www.techspot.com/review/991-gta-5-pc-benchmarks/page6.html>http://www.techspot.com/review/921-dragon-age-inquisition-benchmarks/page6.html>http://www.techspot.com/review/917-far-cry-4-benchmarks/page5.html>http://www.techspot.com/review/878-metro-redux-benchmarks/page4.html>http://www.techspot.com/review/787-thief-benchmarks/page4.html>http://www.techspot.com/review/734-battlefield-4-benchmarks/page6.htmlLook at how Intel performance changes going from 3.5 GHz to 4.5 GHz. In the best case scenario, you get about 5 FPS more, while already being above 60 FPS anyway. And all that is assuming you're not already GPU-bound, which on most of the demanding cases you will be.
>3 fans>And they're not noctuaKill yourself.
>In the best case scenario, you get about 5 FPS more, while already being above 60 FPS anywaySome people play games 120-144fps, anon.
In that case, I doubt going from 60 FPS average to a 64 FPS average will make any relevant difference.

been using the s6 for about a month now shit is speedy as fuck, but a friend i know has a nexus which is equally as fast in my experience. if you want modding definitely nexus, because samsung makes their shit tighter than a trap's ass. but if you want a "does what you want and does it good" phone then the s6 is what you want

>Can you show me an objective review backing that statement up? I'm pretty sure my PC monitor outclasses it by an order of magnitude when it comes to rendering accuracy.It seems there hasn't been many reviews on this one, though older models like the W800B had a grayscale dE 1.07, and a color dE of 2.7>is this supposed to be impressive? “oh look, I can render half the image”Half the BT.2020 color gamut, which is much bigger than AdobeRGB and even NTSC
>What would you suggest, a computer monitor and a media pc or some shit?Forgot to answerDepends too much on your specific requirements to be able to come up with a general answer.You need to at least provide a budget limit, a range of acceptable viewing distances, a range of acceptable screen dimensions, and then understand that you are going to make trade-offs in terms of image quality in order to stay within your budget limit.Sometimes more, sometimes less drastic.
Because I can compare in store with my eyes and objectively say it's fucking nice... Jesus dude how much of a fucking loser are you
But it's still not enough for BT.2020 aka what it will be fucking designed to play back.I'm not familiar with the numbers but 50% BT.2020 sounds like it could be the gamut of BT.709, aka decades old cheap shit that was gimped in order to make it cheaper to mass produce the phosphors.
Nah I don't want your autismo advice, get outta my thread faggot
Holy shit you are full of bait>compare in a store, where everything is intentionally miscalibrated in order to make it as bright and saturated as possible because that captures the attention of faggots like you>most likely compare at wrong distance, giving you a false impression of improvement over an equivalent 1080p display>and objectively say it's fucking niceI think you mean ‘subjectively’. You should read up on the difference between ‘objectively’ and ‘subjectively’, because they're quite important when making statements like these.Something is objective when it's a measurable phenomenon that independent observers will agree upon it. For example, you can use a colorimeter to measure the color accuracy and gamma curve in order to figure out that something is objectively close to the reference ideal.Something is subjective when that statement is based on your perception of something, eg. you can subjectively find one piece of music to be more pleasurable than another person - because it's something you're perceiving with your own senses and then making a subjective assessment of. Same is true for flawed TV “benchmark”.Also, even if you want to push the argument that subjective benchmarks are better for devices meant for the sense, then you should understand that level matching is important as FUCK. For example, you can't compare two headphones accurately if one is 5% louder than the other. We will always prefer the louder one, no matter which one it is. Same for TVs and brightness.This is why music keeps getting louder and louder, and why TVs keep getting bright and brighter. Because of fucking retards like you who stand in a shop and conclude that, based on visual inspection alone (aka how bright and oversaturated it is), one TV is somehow “better” than another.Holy fuck, you should all die. Every single one of you.

Sorry, I didn't realize that you needed a doctorate in science to assess whether or not a TV looks nice Dr. Autisimo.
you can adjust and test settings yourself anon, if it's expensive enough you can also request a dark room viewing 4
Hey OP, here's my advice: If you like it and it's within your budget, get it. Read up on reviews and see how the warranty is or if it's a dud in terms of reliability. If you like how it looks, you will enjoy it. In terms of size, it depends how far away you're going to be from it and how much $800 means to you. I have a 55" tv and its fine for a smaller living room.
This is quite a good idea, but those TV's are edge lit and sometimes it's a lottery to get one without uniformity problems, though you can RMA them until you get a good one
Thanks! I take “autism” as a compliment. If I don't get called autistic when giving advice or presenting an argument, then it means I haven't provided enough useful information in a post.I wouldn't claim BT.2020 covers all the perceivable colors, rather what it attempts to do is cover all of the *natural* colors.BT.2020's phosphors were picked based on empirical trials with highly saturated natural objects under a sunlight equivalent, and then considering a cost trade-off based on various established phosphors that could be readily manufactured on large scales.Basically, BT.2020 is picked to represent colors occurring in the real world as good as possible within the constraints.I'm actually interested to see how UHDTV broadcasting will affect the cinema landscape, since now BT.2020 is being made standard for UHDTV and UHDBD.We could actually reach the point where Blu-ray quality is not just equivalent, but also significantly above what they see in cinemas.Here's hoping we'll see actual 60 Hz UHDBD masters of movies. It would be fucking awesome.
Why would he pay 1.5k for 1080p 70 inch when he can pay 2k for 4k 65 inch?

I already do, every day. I hope that makes you feel happier or something.
I can see whyIf I had to be as autistic as you on a daily basis I'd kill myself too
>The Epson LS10000 actually covers the whole DCI-P3 gamut (the one used in digital cinemas), which is 72% of BT.2020Oh, also, you have to realize that if you want to take advantage of the DCI-P3 gamut then you need to actually get DCI-P3 sources from somewhere. Which you probably can't do unless you break into a cinema.In practice, all home media is BT.709, although that should be shifting to BT.2020 later this year as soon as UHDBD gets cracked. (Which will probably happen a week or so after its release)
:( do you have a job as a color grader or something? you know your stuff but the average consumer isn't going to care nor take any of it
No, I'm just fascinated by this stuff. I maintain the color management code for mpv but that's about it.
If I was OP I would wait to the holiday season to get a new TV.There's actually a lot content for 1080p instead of shit looking 4k streams and the upcoming 4k blu rays that will take forever to get close to the library size 1080p blu rays. I would wait a few more years to adopt 4k.

It really depends on the specific caseThings to consider is if the large CPU cooler will fit, swapping 2x4GB ram to 1x8 GB since mini ITX will only have 2 ram slots, it give you an easier upgrade path, smaller form factor GPUs
Because you didn't study your shitty Java textbook enough
monitor temps during loadrun memtest
Likely due to short circuiting, false && _ == falsetrue || _ == trueIt's a common optimization to not evaluate the rest of a boolean evaluation if the result is already known.  It's language and compiler dependent.
>swapping 2x4GB ram to 1x8 GB since mini ITX will only have 2 ram slotsSorry for being retarded, but why wouldn't I be able to use 2x4gb ram if there's two slots?That looks sexy as hell, but pricey as fuck

>easier upgrade pathIf you ever decide you want to upgrade from 8 to 16 you'll have to throw out your 2x4 instead of just adding another stick
>Sorry for being retarded, but why wouldn't I be able to use 2x4gb ram if there's two slots?if you have 1x8gb you can slap in another 1x8gb later instead of pulling the 2x4gb and buying a 2x8gb kit>That looks sexy as hell, but pricey as fuckI personally think the ncase is for hipsters and autistsbut that's just my opinion
If I'm just doing vidya I don't think I'll necessarily need more than 8 gigs.Is it unsafe to run a high-end video card and an i5 on a mini itx?
Will do when I get home from much part-time job.  Although the GPU never goes above 45c the CPU even on idle is around 50-60 and goes as high as 95 under load.  When I was in an SQT before I was told it was likely a broken temp sensor.  I have perfectly seated the heat sink and yet such high readings. CPU cooler needed?
Never underestimate bloat
>If I'm just doing vidya I don't think I'll necessarily need more than 8 gigs.if it's just games no, but it's nice to have 16gb just so you don't have to close anythingI miss having 16gb>Is it unsafe to run a high-end video card and an i5 on a mini itx?it's perfectly fine if it's not a shit case, most of them have a dedicated vent area for the gpu to draw air
UNIX is shit, but it's the least shit that's currently practical to use, unfortunately.Even decent distros like Debian have weird problems when you start stepping around the automated tools to do things you couldn't do otherwise.
I was just afraid that it'd fucking fry the motherboard or something, not really that it'd overheat, I heard people talk about bottlenecking with a mini ITX build and I was assuming the motherboard itself was the problem and that going too far would ruin everything.If I'm gonna get 1x8, I want to ask if there's a very distinguishable difference in 1x8 and 2x4.
there's enough of a difference to see it in benchmarks and when you're doing full load all the timeand most of the ITX overheating issue is just not having enough fans in the right places, especially when you have a tower cooler not brining any air to the VRM's and ram and shit

What has more/higher permissions in Windows: SYSTEM or TrustedInstaller?
This is kind of a retarded question, but I just wanted to see what you guys thought of this:So for a fun project, I was considering turning a Raspberry Pi board that I've got lying around into a tiny Bitcoin miner. I have heard (based on admittedly cursory research) that Pi boards are actually decent btc miners because apparently they have a relatively low energy consumption rate compared to typical bitcoin mining platforms. I have a vague, retarded plan to get a buddy of mine to sort of squirrel a few of them away somewhere at his work so that I won't have to use my own electricity and ideally the company will attribute the comparatively small spike in power usage to something else or not care altogether. This way, I might actually be able to make a small amount of money instead of just money paying off the power bill.The thing is, you can buy a low-tier Bitcoin miner premade off the internet for  ~$50, which will output about 10 GH/s, whereas a Pi miner will only give out about 1 GH/s individually.  So that means that I'd have to spend over $200 (at $20 per board plus money for an sd card and all the other fittings) to get the same amount of power. So unless the power usage is considerably less, I'd essentially be wasting my time (not that btc mining isn't already a waste of time). But the machine might make it more difficult to hide and steal electricity like the tech savvy homeless person that I am.I guess what I'm asking is, is it even worth it to try this shit or is buying a bitcoin mining machine an actual good investment? Is btc just too dead for it to matter either way?

What is practical if life does not exist to be enjoyed? But life can not be enjoyed if no person ever takes anything seriously. The human species does not exist for a practical purpose, but it creates all it's suffering. So then hedonists are not idiots when they aren't the #YOLOfags that are typically meant by hedonists.

Up until yesterday, I had been able to run most programs without having to click "run as administrator". Today, things seemed to change however as programs began behaving oddly. One example: I launched a video game from its original source, played it for a while and then decided to save but when I restarted the game I couldn't find the save. I decided to search for the name of the save file and eventually found it in virtualstore folder, for some reason. The save was located in the game directory of virtual store, but not the authentic game directory. I ran the game again as administrator and now saved files worked fine. The same thing happened to a few other programs that I run.Does anyone have a clue what this might be?
What actual belefit is there to using Ubuntu 15.04 vs the LTS? I know SystemD is in the newer version, but other than that it just seems like it uses a slightly newer kernel.
>belefitChrist*benefit
they removed amazon spyware. They start to bring mir they have a better support for nvidia drivers (optimus)
If youre running tons of proprietary commercial software (anything from cad to steam) then LTS will be beneficial since they don't update as much (it basically means once you configure a shitty coded software to work on LTS it won't break with an update for next few years hopefully).But if you don't rely of said software then ye, use 15.04, they ditched upstart which is good, and more features don't hurt do they?

I have a question about SSD's, How reliable are they?What are the odds that the SSD controller fails? what could happen if this ever happens? is it normal/frecuent? you can recover data if this happens?

i think to save myself the headache ill just use the 32bit compiler executable because the libraries im using are 32bit
Am I retarded for going for a 8320 for my build? Also rate my build. http://pcpartpicker.com/p/PBJk3C
I think the general feeling these days is that for a normal user an SSD is more reliable than a corresponding quality HDD in terms of mean time before failure.The problem is that as a new product they do have weird stuff pop up on a model-by-model basis, such as some 840 EVO's slowing down due to voltage shenanigans.There are also some concerns about drive corruption on sudden power loss but that's true for platter drives as well and SSDs can often coast through using power stored in their caps.In the case of failure SSDs generally give you a better chance to recover your data than a HDD but it does depend on the type of failure. For the most common types of failure data recovery is more successful on the ssd.
Its not like 4ish years ago, theyre pretty reliable and sometimes a must nowdays
What app is this?
I see, i wanted to buy a Crucial BX100 120GB and i wanted to know something about failures in SSD and what could happen if i had my OS on it and it failed.Thanks, im reading it right now.

Is your question whether you can drop your current HDD into a new computer and boot off that HDD or whether you can plop an old HDD into a computer that already has the OS installed and read data off it?No on the first one, yes on the second.
If you were given the link to a Doubleclick ad, is it possible to view a page source, find out where the digital advertisement should be placed and force the given Doubleclick ad in?
most major SSD or HDD failures will stop your OS from booting. In the case of the SSD there's a greater chance your data can be recovered using another computer.
If I played video games on the lowest settings, would it reduce the heat of my components?
yes, it will get corrupt. There are parts of the file where you can insert stuff without corrupting the format, but you will need a special program for that.If you just need randomness, you can add random bytes instead of zeroes at the end, by using /dev/random for the input file to be used as the "overhead" (i'd say overtail in this case haha)
With VSYNC on, or using some other method of limiting the frame rate, yes.Otherwise it will actually make more heat.
Second one, but the main question was if that hdd already had an os installed to it beforehand could that affect in any way or I should just not give a fuck and plop it in?
Quidquid Latine dictum sit altum videtur.
Thank you most kindly

Where were you when Kubuntu died?https://skitterman.wordpress.com/2015/05/26/i-think-i-may-be-done/
what did that faggot expect when he constantly bashed Canonical?Canonical should have dropped Kubuntu completely when they stopped supporting it years ago instead of letting another company use its trademark and provide support.
Kubuntu Council wants to fight it:http://jriddell.org/2015/05/26/reaffirmed-on-the-kubuntu-council/

blogspam is on it:http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2015/05/kubuntu-project-lead-asked-to-step-down-by-ubuntu-community-council
you are using Kubuntu, retard!Adding one additional repo and installing some codecs by default doesn't change the fact that for 99.9% you are just using Kubuntu.
uh... no? it's two different things. just because they're both ubuntu with kde, it doesn't mean they're the same. HURR DURR
Mint is using the same Ubuntu packages and even piggybacks Canonical's repos. If Ubuntu dies, so does Mint.
thought you meant kubuntu and mint kde. even still, ubuntu dying in 5-10 years doens't mean mint will die as well. there's plenty of time for them to adapt. they also have mint based on debian. you're just buttmad
you have no idea how big the Ubuntu dev community is and how small the Mint one is. >they also have mint based on debian.that's already at its second try and the first one was utter disaster and showed how clueless they are. they can't even build their own debian packages but franken-repack debian's.

>using kde>using a distro for people to stupid to apt-get install a de
They need to cease and decease Kubuntu
If he leaves there is only a crippled Kubuntu left, I mean Jonathan is Kubuntus creator and developer for a decade.Most of the team will also quit with him, there is no doubt about that.
A good day for Debian and their KDE team.
using a distro for people to stupid to apt-get install a deseems like you are one of those to be too stupid to do that. you should use tasksel not apt-get for installing DEs.anyway it's really convenient to have DE flavors instead of manually selecting that at install.
If Kubuntu falls, where else should I turn for a solid integrated KDE desktop? Mageia?
Kubuntu is basically Debian's KDE team, so no.
i dont even use shitbuntuhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Tasksel>Usage (alternative)>Examples:>sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^dank
HAHAHAH, all this because Jonathan asked few hard questions about Canonicals GPL policies and commitment to FOSS, I bet they found out the answers weren't so nice regarding Canonical and their position.
who do you think maintains the KDE packages in Ubuntu, retard?
commercial distros everyone, remember next time you consider fedora
sure, there's a tasksel subroutine in apt-get (notice the caret) but it's not really the same and not recommended.p.s. here's the proper Debian documentation:https://wiki.debian.org/tasksel#Desktop_environment
Red Hat wouldn't have purged him but made up a new more powerful position for some Red Hat employee.
Yes, but I'm talking about rebasing Kubuntu as a distro on Debian, that is the path this will lead if Canonical doesn't budge.Ofc it wouldn't be Kubuntu anymore, perhaps Kebian?
It's pretty much over for Ubuntu and its offshoots.  Ubuntu basically wants to be Microsoft GNU/Linux with all its insecurities and AIDS, and it's not worth using any more given that there are so many other easy to use distros that are so much better than Ubuntu and its derivitives.And if you're in any way experienced with GNU/Linux, if you're not using Arch, you should be.
Kubuntu council changed their constitution(no diff, so no idea what) and voted to keep Jonathan at the helm.http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2015/05/26/%23kubuntu-devel.html
until now, he's moving to debian>if you're not using Arch, you should be.lol, it's so weird nobody but 1 kernel dev gives a fuck about arch like all the /g/ pros
well, Kubuntu devs already maintain most of their packages in Debian proper when possible, because it's upstream for Ubuntu. that's what most Ubuntu packagers do anyway.Debian does have a different release cadence than Ubuntu and Debian leads were against making their own Ubuntu-like releases because there's already Ubuntu.>until now, he's moving to debiannope, he already was a Debian Developer since a long time.
Their loss.
>lol, it's so weird nobody but 1 kernel dev gives a fuck about arch like all the /g/ prosyou know about what kernel devs give even less fucks? old kernel releases! they solely live in mainline.
you know about what kernel devs give even less fucks? stock kernels from some amateur's repo!
nope, you can report issues running an arch kernel just fine. Canonical otoh needs those mainline PPAs and kernel devs didn't even accept their stable kernels as official because they are not maintained by people from the kernel community.

IS there much trouble with modern video cards fitting in micro atx builds?I am planning on buying the BitFenix Phenom M Micro ATX Case and the MSI AMD Radeon R9 280 Gaming Overclocked 3GB Video Card.Should I expect trouble fitting it?
Not at all. Actually MSI's card's fit better than most other cards. My current MSI GTX 960 gaming is thinner than my former Asus GTX 960 directcu. And my case is a micro-ATX
Yes.Assuming your gpu needs cables directly to the psu, expect to be cramming cables in so tight the fans on top won't even spin from getting caught on the fucking cables, if you're unfortunate enough to have a motherboard that puts the gpu in such a position.Its a tight as fuck fit.
I have an MSI R9 290 in my micro ATX build, although I would have liked a Sapphire Tri-X.
In this btw, proper handy for LANs
Fuck off, clueless retard.I have a R9 280 on my SG08 and it fit just fine. There's no difficulty in plugging the cables and no fans get caught in them. I don't even comprehend how someone can come up with something that retarded, unless of course it came straight out of your ass.Not at all, OP. GPUs fit fine on my mITX system, let alone a mATX one. Just check whether your case supports a long GPU without needing to remove the hard drive cages (if you need to remove the cages, get a 5.25" to 3.5" adapter as well).I don't know about that case you mentioned. I know the FD Core 1500 supports long GPUs without removing the cage.
Why don't you get a good case?
>implaying retarded shit like ATX and above is good in any wayHilarious.The only conceivable reason to buy an ATX case is if you literally can't fit stuff into a smaller case. That means at least three graphics cards and/or at least seven 3.5" drives.
What, I said get a good case. Like pic related.
Yes there is. Most modern cards are too long to fit in microATX cases. It's ashame we don't see more of 750Ti sized cards (small and low power).
I am looking for a somewhat inexpensive quality smartphone that will last me for a few years.After some research I am in between the HTC One M8 and the LG G3. Both are said to be great phones but I can not decide:>Both have the exact same chipset>Both feature expandable storage The HTC One M8 is said to have the superior design and is not a phablet, which I like since I want my phone to fit well within my pockets. It is said that it gets hot though.The LG G3 is a bit too big for my liking and has your standard plasticky design but it offers superior 1440p resolution, more RAM and (according to some) superior camera.Do you guys own one of these two? I am looking for realistic expectations from the phones, including battery life, and some advantage/disadvantage to help me settle for one. Any other phone recommendations welcome.
1+1 or zenfone 2
This. The only bad thing about the Zenfone 2 is the lack of custom ROMs though.
I was going for OpO but the lack of expandable memory and the problems with the support kinda pushed me off.About the Zenfone I haven't heard much
That depends. Is the default ROM good?Do you own one? Any compatibility issues?
What do you need more than 64gb of storage for? I have 3k songs on it and still plenty of room left
I like having the occasional emulator with games and perhaps some remastered old games for android.What I care most is the battery life and support.A few Zenfone 2 reviews that I have just seen suggest that the battery is somewhat mediocre, but if someone who owns it can confirm that it is realistically acceptable, I might as well go for it.As for Op One, I am waiting until the cyanogen mod and Oxygen OS dispute ends so I can be sure the phone will be supported for a few years.
Wait for the 1+2 OP
Should I? I am looking for a decent phone for now and I'm not sure when it's out
Lg G4, screw how expensive it is, its fucking worth it.
Bought g3 10 days ago on contract. If you don't plan on rooting avoid it! Screen is heavily over-sharpened, audio playback is buzzing is one channel, default CPU governor is bugged. All of this is easily fixed but only when rooted. When that's done it's a wonderful phone. Try out G3 in store if you think it's too big. Camera is fucking fantastic btw.Avoid 1+1. Don't know shit about Zenfone but I don't trust 2nd grade manufacturers. M8 is not bad but has awful camera and a big frame for it's modest screen size.
I have a 1+1 and love it.
sure, you paying?
Is the zenfone with 2GB of ram still worth is? Or should I get a idol 3?
Battery life will be fixed in upcoming OTA updates. The extremely compotent SE's at ASUS release one every ~10 days.
I do plan or rooting and customizing
Fucking worth it anon, 801s suck. (Coming from a samshit s5 with touchjizz)
Another question about the ZenfoneIs the screen brightness as bad as it is shown in this comparison picture?
And I would get if I had the money.But I don't. Wat do?
Of course I keep an eye on ebay for any inexpensive offerings but I doubt it
check m8 and g3 in stores then, and check camera samples in reviews. their displays and camera is the biggest differentiator. 3gb on g3 is also nice for futureproofing, especially if you use your phones for 2 years.
Brightness is high as fuck actually, I'm always using it on lowest brightness.
If it's between these two, then the G3 as it has a removable battery.
Not necessarily, I am always open for suggestions and I am also considering 1+1 and Zenfone 2
My last phone that just kicked the bucket was a 4S. So I use my phones for a few years, yeah.
I have an HTC one m8. Expect around 5.5 to 6.5 hours of screen time on average. Performance is never a problem. I'd stay away from lollipop on this phone. Screen looks great but the brightness is limited, difficult to see in direct sunlight even at max brightness.
until they die or support is dropped
Why not upgrade? Does it lag?
what about the idol 3? I've heard some great things about it
http://www.gsmarena.com/alcatel_idol_3_%285_5%29-7081.phpAlcatel? They're still around?
Samsung A3
Really? How so? The Samsung A3 doesn't even have an HD screen. I'd at least go for the A5 (which also lacks a full HD screen)
Got the G3 for awhile now.. and still impressed, get a custom clean rom and you are good to go.
http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-two-phone-and-wearable-news/This article is saying about a June 1 release of OnePlus Two.
-I have opo but if expandable memory is an issue, go for zen. It seems amazing.
I'll wait until mid-Summer to see if the OpT get's released. Then I might push my budget to get it if it's as good as people are speculating.
It's well worth it
Ok, I'll wait until June, if OnePlus doesn't release anything - I'll consider the Zenfone.Thanks
Cuckphone 2 :)
LG G4 it's not that expensive compared to iPhone
I will be on the lookout for a G4 at a good price onebay
I bought my 4S pretty cheap locked and it took my a year to manage to get it unlocked - never again.
The s5 is where it's at. I only paid 320 for my unlocked galaxy with 1 day of use. You can't find a phone that is better for the price.
I got tired of all the big screens and got an LG L40 for $60 unlocked. It's shitty but if you don't watch a lot of movies or game a lot on your phone it's perfectly OK for doing productive stuff like email, browsing. One handed operation is wonderful and when you realise that 480 res is perfectly sufficient on a 3.5'''' screen you start to wonder what that K pixel craze is all about. 3mp snaps are OK for Facebook. Wouldn't give a crap if I accidentally dropped it into the toilet which is a great feeling. Fits into any pocket. Runs kitkat. Neat modest little thing.
Samsung phones suck except for the Note line
Except this one. And the s4. And the s6.
I have the lg g3It's alright, I've put on another rom with an lg android flavorEverything is well, battery life is great (don't expect alot of screen time, the screen drains the juice out of the battery if left on), ir blaster that can send and recieve (it can replicate ir signals you point at the ir blaster)People struggle turning on your phone, or ajusting the volume (this is funny)just one mayor big flawThe 3,5 mm port, it's an hardware problem and thus can't be fixed in a whipSo avoid using a normal headphone jack, as it thinks you're giving him commands while you don't even have buttons on themReally, I highly suggest you only use either smartphone headsets, or a bluetooth headsetAs for photo's, it has a laser focus featureIt's slow and most utter useless and you'd still get blurred images if moved slightly while taking a snapThe hardware stabeliser in video recoring is neat, good video's from the hand I must admitOverall, recommand this phone to everyone?No, it took a guy more then 5 minutes to unlock the screen, he needed my instructionsrecommand it to you? Yeah, few tweaks here and there and it's good to last you a few years
Honestly, LG G2. The performance will be almost identical (Snapdragon 800 vs 801), it's got a 5.2 inch 1080p screen with >muh bezelsso it's tiny as fuck. The battery life is better than the G3's. The camera uses the same sensor as the G3 but no lasers.It's like $150 or so on ebay refurbished every other week. If it doesn't last the full two years, spend the extra $150 you saved over the M8 or G3 and upgrade.It does lack the SD card slot and removable battery, but I think most models come with 32GB stock (all of the $150 deals on Ebay that I've seen are 32GB).Also, great ROM communities, all models have root (even fucking Verizon), and I believe most have 5.0 out of the box.
Note 3
This, but as long as you avoid the ATT and Verizon versions.If you happen to be on Verizon, get the Sprint version and take it to Verizon to activate it.If you happen to be on ATT OR TMO, get the TMO version and stick the SIM in.Otherwise you will be in a world of root-less, ROM-less bag of hurt.
I'm going to get the T-Mobile version so what are the best ROM's to use for it
IDK anon, I'm stuck on the ATT version with a couple decent ROMs but that's it.But probably whichever ones in whichever ones of these threads have the highest pageviews.>http://forum.xda-developers.com/note-3-tmobile/development

OP if you're looking for an inexpensive smartphone why the hell are you looking at HTC and LG? Companies that market to the western world are literally stealing from you, the bloatware is also unbearable. Here are some Chinese brands for you to have a look at:Top tier (reputable companies known for decent support and vanities, slightly inflated prices):AsusLenovoTier 2 (Best value for money. Not bad hardware wise, don't expect much more besides that):ElephoneDoogee
I know someone with a One M8, it has serious internal storage limits that make ikt damn near impossible to install anything.
Yes it is, but can be fixed if you modify the power settings.
Tmo note 3 here.Any of the AOSP/CM rom are nice, although sometimes I feel like the battery dies faster than touchjizz based roms. Then again most of those lack features or are wip.
Doesn't that oven cost a bit too much?

I'm pretty damned tired of using Windows on this shitty U56E laptop. All I do is type and surf the web, you guys have any suggestions for a Linux distro? I have used xubuntu and Linux mint in the past. I can't into arch, too time consuming...
For the record I like Windows, it's just it is too damned clunky on this laptop... Things take years to load
Xubuntu is great, but seeing as you already tried it, maybe try Fedora.
481802Thanks mate
Antergos. Its like arch without the long install.
>Xubuntu>Lubuntu>Slackware>DebianThe fourth one means you also need to be using hardware they have drivers for, otherwise it ends up being a bigger pain than arch would.Pretty much any distro, above are just uncontroversially okay if you come from windows and don't have developed taste yet. They can all type and all have whatever stupid browser you're using.
Antergos + Oprnbox, i3, or Gnome 3 with Plank and Shellscape.
OSX
It's not very popular, but if you like Windows, try the Deepin distro. It's pretty, and easy to use.
Hello /g/. Looking for a private tracker for college textbooks. Would be very helpful. Any info appreciated. I have already searched all open trackers for some books I need and none have them.
I can only speak for my college but they were essentially shills for the books.>you NEED the book>not having the book is NOT OPTIONAL>we WILL use the book EVERY DAY>never need it a single time besides for retarded reference when they say "oh you can find this on page xxx" and that doesn't really count
Agreed. However, I would like the books incase.

Why aren't there more semiprivate trackers like BakBT for not anime? Or at least a book tracker that is easy to get into?

You could probably get a job as a computer programmer, OP.

Those all sound terrible.
Are you asking because you don't know? Or is this hypothetical? A simple Google search would have pointed you in the right direction...>JavaScriptA lot of web development. Front-end devs use it to add any interactivity into a webpage, while it's getting popular on the back-end as a server language because it's event-driven nature makes it a natural fit for responding to HTTP requests.>JavaAll over the place. A lot of it is older enterprise (corporate) applications, because Java apps can easily be run on any OS. I hear of more gamedevs using it since Notch made his jillions of dollars with Minecraft, but I wouldn't recommend it. I guess you could also be an Android dev, but good luck making money with that.>C>C++Honestly haven't developed in either to really say. Since they're so low-level, a lot of older legacy systems are built in C/C++. Also, a lot of embedded systems ie, anything running off a chip. A lot of game engines (especially 3D) are built in C or C++ because the system is so low-level, making them blazing fast.>PythonPython is largely a language used by people who aren't programmers. Probably mostly jobs as a researcher>C#Like Java, a lot of these are enterprise applications. There's also a lot of webapps written in C# using IIS for hosting. Of course, there's also a fair amount of Windows programs written in the language as well.
Are there any alternatives to JavaScript? Or anything that works well with it?
For front-end dev work? No, not really. Google was trying for awhile to create a language called Dart, that compiled down to regular JavaScript. The plan was to get all browsers onboard for using that as a client-side language so that everybody could start moving away from JavaScript, but it never went anywhere. There's a couple other languages (CoffeeScript, TypeScript) which also compile down to JavaScript, but honestly I would urge you to learn JS before giving them a shot anyways.Most of the same goes for back-end work using nodejs. You could write your server code in Dart, CoffeeScript, or Typescript, and have it compile down to JS, but... there's not really a point to it. Of course, on the backend, you don't /need/ to use JS. You could just as easily write it in any other language.
If you want to do web development, there's really no way around learning JS. It's actually not a bad language, you just have to spend a couple of years coming to terms with some of its shortcomings and its long list of "gotchas".
Thanks. So what is nodejs really? Google hasn't really helped.

To add onto this, if you want to get any decent work, you should learn back end JavaScript like MEAN Stack. Easy to use, easy to learn, and it's becoming increasingly more popular.

How the hell will 'rootless' security work in OS X 10.11?
You might want to consider adding a Dell xps 13 on there.
Thanks for the suggestion but the XPS 13 is already on there
Whoops, didn't see it.
Redirected from a post I made a few minutes ago:So, I've got a mid 2010 MacBook Pro 13", and it's time for a change.Last summer I was about to buy the 15" MBP Retina, but I heard about the Broadwell processors so I waited. Now that Apple is skipping those and jumping directly to Skylake, should I wait another year or buy the Force Touch 15" MBP recently released?Give me your opinion.Pic related. What a beautiful motherfucker.
You may want to consider putting one or two of the cheaper models on as well.
Now is as good a time as any as they've just been updated. WWDC in 13 days but i doubt there will be any macbook hardware talked about there
I'll have a look if the cheaper ones compete with the MBAs
Yeah, I really doubt it to. Well, I guess I've waited long enough.I'm probably buying the machine next week.BTW, any of you tried the Force Touch? How does it work?
I hope they redo the Graphics UI renderer on OS X 10.11. It currently lags like shit on any Retina MacBook.Doing Bokeh style transparency on a PDF (Open Document) renderer is just so inefficient.It's embarrassing since Windows 8.1 runs butter smooth on even Intel Atom tablets with 2048x1536 resolution.
just the Flash storage alone will make it a speed freak compared to your old 5400rpm mbp
Jony Ive promoted. Again. 
I have the same problem with my MBA. sometimes it gets very choppy. Yosemite is pretty buggy. I'm glad there doing a bit of a quality control update again with 10.11
>BTW, any of you tried the Force Touch? How does it work?Just like a regular MacBook trackpad but there's multiple levels of click.Like pressing a camera button, there's a half press and a full press. You can customise what each type of press does.The vibration of the touchpad feels and sounds really close to an actual click.
Apparently it's just so that they don't have to disclose his compensation amount
>Apple GeneralLet's make Android General, Linux General, Browser General and Windows General while we are at it.
I really can't even imagine how much of a difference there will be. It's been worth the wait.
there are usually android generals and thinkpad generals
The purpose of this thread is trying to condense 20 shitposting Apple threads into this 1 thread, leaving more room for actual quality threads on /g/.
Who are you to consider what is shit posting? If it is tech related and does not break the rules set forth then fair game. There is a dragon dildo thread that seems up your alley.
Fuck off appleshill.
This is an Apple thread, bitch.
Good. That's what I wanted, the trackpad was too good to change it too mach. And the camera example is perfect.
Then keep it in your thread :^)
>/hm/Stay on your board. ¦P
with the force touch you can even click it right up the top just as easily as the bottom. Pretty sweet, though you do get used to clicking the bottom of the old ones
Yeah, I've seen that, but I'm so curious about the feeling of the 'click'... I will know in a few days.
New betas in half an hour probably.Are you ready?
Source? Looking for iOS 8.4 Beta 4.
Hey guys, does anyone know what Starbucks has the fastest Wi-Fi in the Upper-East NYC area? My Macbook Pro is coming on Thursday and I just can't wait to show off this beauty. My sister just got the new MacBook. I mean true, there is only one port and it almost snapped in half when she dropped it, but apart from that this thing is revolutionary! Can't wait for the iPhone 7. I hear they are going to make it thinner AND lighter!! Wow
i haven't bothered with the current betas but i'll probably cave and try the WWDC DPs
Well they release on two week periods, they were supposed to release it yesterday but they didnt probably because of holidays. Are you looking for a public or developer beta? I can give you a link for the public beta profile if you want.
Ive added the $999 XPS 13 Config to OP guide. Any more suggestions?
I currently have iOS 8.4 Beta 3 Dev installed. I was expecting the update yesterday. Forgot it was a holiday.
I would go for the 2015 RetinaPlus Macbook Pro, with the $200 SSD upgrade it is super-fast! Granted, the CPU isn't any more powerful and it does throttle at 1.2Ghz after it reaches ~185 degrees, but it is great apart from that! Unfortunately the Retina display on mine cracked and I had to pay $800 for them to put a new one in, but I'd say it's money well spent. Next time I will remember to get extra AppleCare!
Maybe go back to >/lgbt/?
get out.
a response to him was not necessary
Go rub your dick on your overpriced aluminium piece of shit
Yeah!! I can't wait to see what great new features Apple come up with! The day iOS8 came out was amazing. Some people say they stole most of the additions from Android but I just tell them that Apple is revolutionary.

Add samsung ATIV books to MBA comparison, Dell xps 13 3200x1800 model
thanks i'll check out the samsung. the dell is already there but with that display it becomes competition to the rmbp so it's in that table instead
>the dell is already there but with that display it becomes competition to the rmbp so it's in that table insteadI'd argue that you should only put models that arent using Ultra low Voltage CPUs with the MBPr, since the class of product between the xps and the mbpr is different. ( browsing & media consumption vs media creation)
Not comparable because they have shit-tier screensIf the MBP had a shit-tier screen it would be half the price tooLiterally how fucking autistic are you that you can't figure this out?

what's the performance difference of a 2.7GHz ULV to a 2.7Ghz non ULV though?
sorry about the language.
Yeah it is it's pretty slick right? http://osxdaily.com/2015/05/20/use-san-francisco-system-font-in-os-x/That guide has the downloads. you don't have to follow it and make it your system font though
at burst, none, at sustained the CPU throttles so that the continuous power usage matches the TDP, in this case 15W. So a whole hell of a lot of throttling in high-performance applications and none in lightweight ones.
ok i might leave it there but i'll add ULV in the CPU spec of all models that have it.
same specsit´s time for a change (si tan solo tuviera dinero...)
Kind of a weak table.  You should include actual battery life, at least, since you're not distinguishing between CPU lithographies.

Give me one reason why I should choose Samsung S6 over LG G4.One reason
No
metal
Girls only sleep with dudes with popular phones.LG is not popular.
>subjecting yourself to Samshit>everthere is no reason, OPget the G4
Blast processing.
You shouldnt, the LG G4 is the superior smartphone >superior battery life >removable battery >SD Card slot up to 2TB max capacity(wtf)>far more durable >more comfortable to hold especially with leather backs >superior camera >bigger screen
My friends and I recently threw our money together and bought a OnePlus One for each of us. We love it more than our families.
S6 is more expensive, and everyone knows it is more expensive. Normies like Samsung, so an expensive Samsung will make you rise above
Samsung better pixels and faster processor.Only thing G4 has going for it is better front camera.
Samsung S6 hasn't got retarded button placement.
>better pixels I take it english isnt your first language, they have the same amount of pixels and use different screen technologies(quantum LCD vs Super AMOLED) with the LG G4 being the more color accurate while the AMOLED is saturated
>with the LG G4 being the more color accurateAs long as the color isn't black, which the G4 will display as "dark gray."
Not true at all
why would you ever put yourself in the position to pick between two Korean cell phoneshave some respect for yourself and buy a damn iphone
Hahhahahahhahha You cant be serious
>buying korean shitWait for the next Nexus release or the Z4
I wanted the fucking phone but they don't ship nor receive payments from Mexico. Congrats for buying it damn it.
Neither of those will have a better camera or removable battery, Nexus wont even have an SD card
No its true, its true for most non-AMOLED screens, although some LCDs do look black the G4 is dark gray.
Nope. Ever since note 4, there was a mode in settings that allowed you to get accurate color from the display
Again, not true at all, the black colors on my nexus7 dont look grey in any way, so that makes you a liar

Hi /g/ i need your help, today i bought a Yamaha AX-430 Reciever for $40 i just connected my speakers and all works good but the subwoofer.Yamaha' subwoofer output is RCA but my subwoofer is wire, any way to make it wokr, tried >pic relatedthis but doesn't work
Wow. I'm actually having the same problem with a pioneer receiver. I tried running the RCA to a RCA jack, wired right to the sub. It didn't work. Then I noticed that the RVA jack says "Pre Out". This leaves Mr thinking hat it actually requires an externally powered sub or sub amp. I think it's actually outputting line level on the sub out meaning it won't drive it on its own.
Just got a C1 and want to make it my HTPC so I don't have Amazon recording me or buy an antiquated Apple TV.I'm a beginner to microprocessors and know that the C1 probably wasn't the friendliest board for beginners, but I figured that the possible gains in power outweigh the lack of support through odroid's community.Anyway, would anyone kindly share some resources on how to get familiar with what be done with boards such as the odroid and rpi as far as creating your own HTPC (xbmc + lakka + etc.) goes?Also, I remember there being an application for Android/iOS that was popular among infantry abroad that allowed them to get channels for free - is there something like similar for Kodi or xbmc?

That was me!  I hope I don't regret the purchase.  You should work for SNSV, you are a good marketer.  Do you even have one?
mine came in today, really like it so far
How does Apple not block this shithole website?Do they shill from the store?
Good to hear.  I hope I can get reasonable battery life once I'm done debloating it.  It just changed the status of the order from "packaging" to "shipped", so hopefully it gets here by Friday! :D
They pay for shilling here, are you new?
Just factory reset. Lollipop is perfectly fine on my D802.
>They pay for shilling hereooh, look who thinks he matters
shill pls
Search for stock 4.4 for your phone and for cwm recovery, then flash cwm recovery through pc, and finally put stock ROM zip file on sd card and flash it from cwm.Xda should have all the info.
That is a shame, if you can root it, I would.Nexus 5 here:>OptiPop Rom (5.1.x base)>Uber KernelI get slightly better screen on time when going all out than I did on KitKat, and it has the smoothness and speed of Lollipop.Don't get me wrong, I waited a very long time to upgrade to Lollipop, but once 5.1.1 was released, I felt it was safe, and it turned out fine.
Install a custom rom, I'm using blisspop and everything is working fine.
Same, g2 & G3 User here, Option 1: Factory Reset - Apparently fixes most bugs and gets the phone running how it shouldOption 2: Install a Cloudy Rom, Great Roms, Deodexed ( see cloudyg2 - cloudyg3)Option 3: Revert to KK
>not doing a factory reset after getting lollipopAlso dont forget to downgrade your bootloader to JB before going back to KK
Am I the only one here who loved the update?Apart from status bar color not adjusting to apps (yet) it's an epic update. Looks sexy as fuck. Fast. Battery life got better. I dunno. Lucky I guess. :3

>Apart from status bar color not adjusting to apps (yet) it's an epic update.Why would someone want this?
It looks good that's why
same herebattery life seems about the same, memory usage is a bit better, that's about it.
Me fucking too!! Lollipop crippled my G2 and I'm pissed! It used to be such a good phone. Now it's crap!
Still crap after restore.
How does one revert to KK?
Thanks OP. At least I'm not crazy and can vent a little about it.

Sure it's decent...But is it $389 decent?
Have you seen the hardware in them laptops compared to the laptops made today?The hardware was so power hungry that it has to run hot being in such a small space with one air vent.For a 2010 model laptop it was possibly one of the top 10 on the market at the time.
I got mine for $385 the seller i bought from was selling them for $369 last time i looked im not trying to push sells for him im kinda pissed that my Ethernet port is kinda fucked the cable don't clip into the port so if not care the cable will fall out.Intel i7 2.67 Ghz Dual Core8GB DDR3 memory1080p mattie display250GB HDDfor under $400 im not gonna complain.

Op whatever you do DO NOT TRY TO SWITCH IT ON WHILE ITS STILL WETput it in a bowl or rice or beans and let it sit for a week, you could try and open it so the water evaporates 100%
I did this. It worked for me. Good luck, OP.
1. OP was pushed into a pool2. The iPhone cannot be turned off by quickly removing the battery, meaning that the phone was definitely on for an unspecified amount of time while soaking in water. That phone is fucked. Unless you shut it off immediately after getting wet, and don't turn it back on, better off just replacing it.
this  worked well on my iphone 5s
Put it in a bag filled with rice over night. The rice will attract asians that will fix your phone in exchange for the rice.

You're fucked anon. You're not getting anything and if you push it, they're going to claim you bullied that girl and "I was drunk, I didn't know". Just buy a new phone or if you have insurance, use that.
Dropped my note 4 in the toilet the other day. Thought it was waterproof like the s5. Proceeded to rise it off for 20 seconds in the sink. Broke it. Paid 149 for a new one because insurance. Sucks that I had to pay that but I would never inebriated but a used electronic device or pay 850 for a phone.
Your phone is probably fucked.  Just pay the bitch back by pushing her into some water.  Make sure that water is at a rolling boil when you do it.
easy just quickly take off the batt-oh wait
Put it in a bags of sand
She's over the age of 21 and she was the one who suggested drinking.  Like I said, I have two people who are witnesses to this.
Sue the person who pushed you ffs.
Only $60?Well she better get a work.Tell her to save up that money cuz you are going to need a new phone and not a refurbished one is not okay, either you do the right thing or we will take this to the law, you gotta take responsibility from your actions.

what is there to explain?  its easy to show hidden files and hidden OS files, and unlike osx or linux machines, whether you have a dedicated window open or an open/save dialogue box, you still have 100% functionality instead of just being able to make a folder and only make a folder
What I hate about Word is that a simple thing like numerating the pages starting at page 3 can't be simple.I hate that there so much unnecessary shit and stuff that should be simple is fucking impossible to do.
I make a point to enable file extensions and show hidden files on every machine I touch (IT guy), and I wouldn't do the latter if ctrl-h was a thing on Windows>get a phone call>"What is thumbs dot dee bee? Is it a virus?"
I think hidden files shouldn't exist.If you have to hide a file then it shouldn't be there in the first place.A big warning sign like the one on Windows XP should be good enough for hiding system files.Both OSX and Windows do this shit (thumbs.db and .DS_STORE files). I don't know about ext4 on Linux.Thumbnail data and other metadata should be contained within the archive on formats with open specifications like ID3 on mp3 files.
it's shit. all of it
hyper-v is legit.  it is so fast and smooth.  It comes for free with 8.1 pro, in case you didn't already know that.  I love how easy it is to manage, especially with powershell etc.
>giving /g/ access of any kind to a server with thousands of accounts connecting to itGOOD IDEA
I like their OS cause it just werks honestly. If Windows were to disappear from the world tommorow then it would be a fucking nightmare since nothing comes close when it comes to usability.
I like the ecosystem, everything has been working flawlessly>WP>win 8.1 desktop>win 8.1 laptop
OS X.Shame about application compatibility with Windows, but it's nearly fully compatible with anything *nix.

>OS Xkek. Locked down to death and doesn't work properly on 99% of hardware out there. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
Outlook.com really needs better contact syncing with Android.And a way to sort contacts in folders.It's like they intentionally made a flawed email service.I like that you can disable the ability to login into aliases.
Windows is great when it's not your computer. Active Directory is the easiest shit ever, Powershell knows a good amount of BASH commands, it's fast, snappy, and works out of the box.I'd honestly only use Linux at home if I wasn't using AMD stuff (open source and closed source drivers are fucking crap). But at work? I love Windows.
>Locked down to death No.>doesn't work properly on 99% of hardware out there.He asked for a software alternative.
Linux (like any other Unix) hides things that start with a dot by default, but it's only for convenience and hiding config files.  It's trivial to show them by flipping an option (usually Ctrl-H) in your GUI file manager, or by passing the -a flag to "ls" from the shell.
>laptop crashes and blue screensare you working on XP or what?
That scene was kinda cringy if I recall correctly.Nigger gets all pissed off. She's cute as fuck though.
consider yourself lucky you could even hit your nas.  holy shit it was a nighmare getting my macbook to reach my freenas share, or even a normal windows share.and then holy shit good luck if you put the computer to sleep while still connected.  i cant count how many times i woke the computer up after having a share open in finder to realize that the finder was 100% frozen, couldnt change folders, couldnt do jack shit and the only fix was to reboot the god damn computer
I had a blue screen on 8.1 while it was IN THE PROCESS OF SHUTTING DOWN.  That rustled my jimmies like you wouldn't believe.
This. On a standalone basis, Linux trumps all others, with compatibility, performance, and user-friendliness (not babby-duck "the way it used to be).With any networking whatsoever, though, Windows is mandatory if you ever want any kind of stability.
kek.For a while my Windows XP installation showed a Visual Studio C++ Runtime error THE EXACT SECOND it shut down.

Who /excited for windows 10 package management/ here?If it's good, it may be enough to make me switch back.
>With any networking whatsoever, though, Windows is mandatory if you ever want any kind of stability.That's only "networking" in the sense of "remote managing desktops".  Linux owns the server and embedded space outside of Exchange (although Openchange exists) and managing Windows desktops (although Samba4 lets it be a domain controller).
>Computer crash nearly caused the loss of important data>thank god the document was recoverable! hail microsoft!backward logic, in future remember to save the document often if you are working on a system so much unstable.
I've tried Chocolatey, which it's based on, and believe me it's no apt-get.  It's probably closer to OpenBSD package management in terms of features and repository size, only it deals in .msi files.
That's probably what he meant, man. Server management via Linux, but user administration and workplaces in Windows is what a lot of companies run.
last bluescreen i had was on vista, 4 years ago. never had on 7 or 8
Semantics. I'm the guy running Linux servers on the 2012r2 box. But any domain / remote access / terminal services system I set up is all Windoze.And Exchange is every sysadmin's bad girlfriend. It fucking sucks but everyone wants it and nobody can work without it.

Same here, using 7 now and other than when I downloaded a damaged nvidia driver update, the only blue screen happened when I changed mobo, for the drivers. Resolved in less than 1h (pic related). The video driver issues can be fixed easily in safe mode + internet connection, redownloading and reinstalling the driver.
bluescreens are usually cause by shitty drivers he probably has a nvidia card or something
That's because macfags are mostly idiots, with a smattering of grumpy old people that want unix on their laptop and don't like Linux or OpenBSD.
Even among savvy mac users (they exist, memes aside) there's this culture that shit should just work for macs, that everything ought to be handed in on a silver platter.I guess you learn to expect the car to work all the time if there's no way to open the hood.

That's your distribution's fault for not automatically rerunning DKMS for the new kernel when it was installed.  Debian does not have this problem.
but amd drivers have never caused my system to crash
Then count yourself lucky.

everything works for me. all games, all programs, no bullshit. I have a job and don't have the time to fiddle around and try to make things work on Linux. Everytime I install linux, it seems great at first then I try to watch a video and I have to remember how to repackage (or whatever) flash to my specific distro and I quickly remember why I went back to windows in the first place.

I recently switched to Linux and LibreOffice. It can do most of what Office does but I did notice that when I copy paste something into LibreOffice there is no option to Merge and Format, so I have to make it the same size and format manually. It is a pain. Linux can do anything else though as far as I have seen.

anyone written or designed a compiler?  Tell us your story.  Details.
Where the fuck do you think you are?99.9% of the people here havent even managed to get their helloworld to compile, how the fuck do you expect us to make a compiler.The closest you will get is some guy making a script that just renames all the filename extensions to .exe and calls it a day.
My friend is making a language. Thats as close as I have gotten to making one

Don't have to be mad just cuz im right
Oh please technology master, teach me your ways.Fuck off loser, you're probably dumber than anyone else here.
I wrote a macro system on top of brainfuck (with some of its own functionality) but that only transpiles to regular brainfuck.I wonder if anyone here has actually created a nice little language.
>implying i claimed i was smarter than anyoneYou're so butthurt i must've been right about something tho, why else would you bitch and moan like that.
He is almost right, samefag.
Yup, wrote one for Java in undergrad
bump
everybody to the limit!
I did most of my compiler writing in college.First was a basic-esque language that compiled to a little stack-based VM the teacher wrote.Second was a lisp (interpreter, not compiler) that had haskell features such as list comprehensions.Third was a C compiler (structs, arrays, ints, and all combinations like structs within structs containing arrays of structs etc.) plus functions, do/while, for, if/else, switch, etc. that compiled to x86 asm.I've been out of school for a while working professionally. Currently designing a language that will replace *my* usage of C++.
An assembler is closest I've made.
I haven't.  I will eventually, unless I die first.
Yup I have. I've done a C-like language in the past, but it was utter shit. I've also done 2 mini Lisp interpreters just for fun/learning. Right now I'm working on my first "real" language, which is based partially on ML but has some differences in the type system plus some other changes. I'm still basically stuck on type inference, although I do have about 3/4 of the front-end of the compiler done. Once I'm done with the type inference part I'm gonna do my first of 3 backends, which will be {My Language}->Rust, but I'm also going to do LLVM and x86 back-ends when I finish that.If you're new to making compilers here are some tips:- Use an ML: It doesn't matter if it is F#, OCaml, Standard ML of New Jersey, or whatever the fuck else exists. Even Haskell will do (although good like writing a pure compiler). Variants, pattern matching, tuples, etc. make writing a compiler a fucking breeze.- Translate to something you're familiar with. Don't try outputting x86 assembly if you've never used it before. Although some of the output will just be basic patterns you can reuse, be ready to have to use some higher-level features to hack some functionality in.- Use a lexer and parser generator (and not something that does both). For OCaml, I recommend Menhir/Ocamlyacc+Ocamllex. For F# there's an fslex and fsyacc I believe. If you haven't listened to my first piece of advice, use ANTLR for Java or Bison and Flex for C/C++/Objective-C. I wouldn't advise using PEG.js (only mentioning because I just saw someone using it earlier today) since it tries to combine both. Don't roll your own until you've used a generator.- Fuck optimization. If you're just trying to learn, don't bother with it at all. Wait until you know what you're doing to try your luck at it, and for this you /must/ know the ins and outs of what you're compiling to.
Wow I just typed like a retard.>although good like writing a pure compilers/like/luck/Oh, and also I might write my own VM for the language before I do LLVM and x86, since I am kind of scared of trying to write functional x86 until I've fucked with my own VM for a while.

My vote is for the google keyboard, but if you don't want muh botnet, try swiftkey. Both great.

Windows:>only one window open in program>click the "X" in the top-right corner>program closesLinux:>only one window open in program>click the "X" in the top-right corner>window closes but program is still running in the backgroundWhy? Is there a reason for this?
because you aren't using terminal like a true neckbeard.
What program does this?I've only encountered this once or twice, I think it's mostly OSX that does this.Although windows also has it's fair share. (I'm looking at you, skype.)
Actually on Linux you can just send SIGKILL instead of SIGTERM.  There is no equivalent on Windows because its closed source and you can't change the behavior.
It's the other way around, on Windows Skype, Steam, etc. minimize when you press X while on Linux they close.
Both operating systems do both you idiot.When you press 'X' on Steam on Windows, it's still running in the background. It's just dependant on how the program chooses to deal with the close signal.
There are programs that are fairly good at killing other processes.And typically if you taskkill everything in a process' wait chain, you can successfully kill it without needing other methods.
Skype is so gay I open task manager to kill it bc the X minimizes it instead of closing it
Nope, I don't use skype, however steam resides in tray.
xkill is an excellent example of a linux graphical program killer, if anyone is looking. Or just don't install programs that force that kind of behaviour upon you.
You can configure whether the process closes or minimizes to run in background on Windows.
>Or just don't install programs that force that kind of behaviour upon you.Easier said than done since everybody and their mother uses Skype.
Skype, spotify, origin, steam Heh i prob deserve it though
That's true, but I'm never going to put up with a program that abuses it's privileges. Moment a program starts intentionally doing what skype does, and it's gone.
Skype/Steam behave identically on windows in this regard, and for steam I think it's an option.Spotify/Origin I weren't aware even existed on linux, but I'm pretty sure they both behave the same as well...Don't use programs that are abusers. End your relationship with abusive programs.
Use the terminal you fucking autist.
/g/ doesn't though. Hopefully. It's not even a>muh FOSS problem, there are just better altenatives you can use to chat with your chummers.
>use the terminal you fucking autistThe irony :')
Umm don't most apps in Linux do that as well?
Yes, I'm pretty sure I can count on one hand the programs that I know do this OOTB on linux, and most let you turn it off easily.In fact, skype is the only one that I know of that can't be turned off.
>I open task manager to kill it bc the X minimizes itYou know you can just right click it on the taskbar and "Quit Skype", right?
you cannot simply quit skype
care to elaborate? are you referring to the programs that hides in the system tray? why are you saying that this only happens on linux?

I am open to more options above the $800, but lets not go too high.Extras:Any awesome monitors around? Keyboards? Mouses?

>baits: the thread
Diminishing returns doesn't mean it's wasted. Everything runs into diminishing returns, so you have to spend more on the luxuries that really matter to you.I don't buy very much, so I have a good amount of money. I spend a lot of time on my computer and do tasks that demand power, so I really care about performance. Computers also aren't that expensive compared to other luxuries. $2,000 gets you an absolute top-of-the-line machine, and you'll only have to upgrade every two years or so. That means that I don't mind the diminishing returns.
Fucking Nerf Guns... I lost so much money when you fags convinced me to get all the Nerf Guns. They ain't even good.
You do hit a wall with audio stuff, although  was exaggerating a bit.  My DAC was $60 and it's perfect.  Amplifiers/receivers tend to get really silly after $600 or so.  But that's just me, I guess.
Holy shit nuggets, I have a VERY similar model of that stereo.
Of course. You hit a wall with computers, too. For almost all people, a $2,000 system would be BETTER than a $10,000 system.A wall is a problem, but diminishing returns is not necessarily a problem.
after $600? are you delusional? amps cost bananas to produce and to have a 1:1 signalfor /g/ you're all pretty fucking stupid and clueless when it comes to audio and electronics
let me guess you have it hooked up to your pc too instead of a simpler and cheaper usb interface
>more than $20 for a receiver>more than $40 for bookshelvesYou mean that lepai "20W amp' that reaches 10% distortion @ 9W into an 8ohm load, that also comes with a power supply that isn't even capable of outputting the rated wattage?

Sure they're good for the price, but they're not that good in general. They're decent if you want desktop speakers, but you're not going to be good for movies, or even for background music when you have a few friends over. Fuck the lepai isn't even good at all, just ultra cheap
I am clueless about audio. My aesthetic sense sucks and my ears have never been very good.I can tell you all about the electronics of it, but I do not know what sounds good. I can only work with the objective measurements.

Alright /g/uys I'm planning on building my first pc soon and I need help deciding something Should I go for-500GB SSD and fx 6300or-250GB SSD and fx 8320e
500gb +6300
Will the eight core make much of a difference, I want more power over storage
wait for zen
I'm on a budget they'll probably be expensive no?
>amd>expensive
Look up the benchmarks I don't think the 8 core was a lot better. My fx 6300 is oc at 4.1 never seen it crash on a stock cooler
>amdinto the trash it goes
6300 + 500GB SSD, hands down
>AMD>I want powerWhich is it? If you want a powerful computer, do not purchase an AMD CPU. For the price of the 6300, you could get an Intel Core i3-4160. This is a far better chip for real-world tasks, despite having fewer cores.Also: You should be getting both a 1TB HDD for slow media and a small SSD for OS and applications. I use a 120GB SSD and it works out fine, even though I dual boot.
>people actually consider buying AMD CPU'sI know intel are literal jews but jesus christ.
OP do you think 8 cores are good enough?Think again!AMD will release ZEN soon which will feature 16 cores with over 2 flotation points to make sure you'll never get to use this power
>flotation pointstop kek
>AMDyou're making a big mistake anon
That's like a $50 difference. Why not save an additional week and not compromise?The worst thing is feeling like you need to upgrade right after you finish building.You really should spend a good while setting aside some money until you can get at least a good i5 and a 970/380X. Get a board with good SLI/Crossfire support, a high maximum TDP, 16GB of RAM and more storage than you think you'll ever use. Intel boards stay relevant for much longer than AMD boards too. Also a good power supply, something 80+ rated with at least 650W.Now you have a great PC for not that much money that is essentially future proofed for when you want to upgrade again 4 years down the line.
>Thinking that an entire brand is shit.You're the cancer this board deserves.
They literally don't have any chips worth buying, though. Their competitor is better at every price point.
Has AMD even made a decent processor since the 965be?
Don't listen to these faggots, personally I have an fx8320, undervolted and OCed to 4ghz, I don't think I will need a new cpu for at least 5 years, probably more. I'm not sure what you want to do with a 500gb SSD though? Just get the 250gb and a 1TB HDD, there's not enough important programs that need the speed of an SSD to warrant 500gb, and if you do need it in the future, just get a second one and do RAID, which will be even faster.
Also don't forget, intel cpus need intel sockets, and motherboards with those cost more. And the whole thing with the new intel cpus since ivy bridge I think having their metal lid on top only put on with some thermal paste. Wait 2 years and have fun with 70°C cpu temperature, because the thermal paste degrades over time.There's no reason for an intel cpu, unless all you play is skyrim all day.
>amd cpuwas building a shit pc part of your plan?
>amd cpus
0/10, almost like the price/performance of intel cpus.
You dont think you need Intel CPU because all you ever experienced was AMD. Please stop spreading your delusional thoughts of a 18y/o who can't afford a CPU that actually performs.
Please tell me what I missed, who knows I might just buy one if you really change my mind with some nice arguments.
AMD CPUs also need AMD sockets, are you serious? Have you ever even seen a computer in real life?
>its like a xbox but bigger right??
Motherboards with amd sockets cost like 70% of what the same motherboard with an intel socket costs you retard. Not fooling anyone here, intel employee.
>Also don't forget, intel cpus need intel socketsNo shit,>and motherboards with those cost more.Do they? I got an H81 board for £30. Fully featured Z97 boards are ~£60.>And the whole thing with the new intel cpus since ivy bridge I think having their metal lid on top only put on with some thermal paste.

That's another good reason.

Might actually be a good idea to get a cheap cheap h97 board and slap an i3 on it. Until zen comes out that is. The fx 8 core is good if u plan on utilizing the extra cores. U need a more expensive mobo in my experience compared to intel mobos (1150)..I had an fx  6300 originally and oc it to 4.5 ghz. It was preddy gud for games and also single core was better.I upgraded to an fx 8320 since it was on sale for 99.99 at microcenter (leas than i paid for my 6 core ) and sold the fx 6300. Its much better at a lower oc of 4.0ghz (barely over stock turbo of 3.9) My uses are mostly games and some 3d rendering. If u plan on virtualsing ever or maybe streaming gameplay, the 8 core will pay off.For stirctly games a 6 core at a potentially higher OC can yeild better results. The lower tdp (95w) makes overclocking it much easier than the 8 core at 125w tdp. I also like to run many many programs side by side and extra cores pay off there too.I use: zbrush, autodesk, blender, cs5, illustrator/inkscapeGames : titanfall, bioshock inf, batman games etc.Cant really say too much about the newer games since i buy em cheap after some time goes by...but I imagine dx12 will make the extra cores of the fx 83xx much more useful for vidya too.
Thats a joke unless ALL you do is game. For professional tasks like rendering 3d and video encoding it will tromp an i5 for half the price. Hell my fx 8320 is marginal to an i7 in the tasks i listed and its a third of the price.Op if you need notepad to launch 5 ms faster by all means fall for the i3 meme.You said u want power but didnt say in what regard. An fx 8 core will destroy an i3 in raw compute any day of the week. The integer based calculations are miles ahead of even a 4770k but the fpu is weaker than the i5s. But the i3? A joke
writing from OP's picdon't know why i said this
Theres nothing wrong with AMD cpus, contrary to half the haters posting. You're not doing computation that will take weeks to deliver results so a small performance % hit is negligible in day to day usage. Even more if you can get it at a considerable lower price.I'd say you should try to hit the sweet spot in space versus price with the SSD. It isn't rational to splurge big bucks on a big SSD right now when in the near future prices will keep dropping. SSDs by their nature, and at the stage they are now, aren't made to serve as storage units. Get an HDD for that. Or else you'll end up creating a thread here in the near future about how your SSD prematurely wore out. Save on the SSD, get a decent CPU, check if you're able to do some overclock, and save even more on the CPU. Get a good PSU and a good motherboard that let's you stretch the cpu legs. Good memory so that you don't bottleneck.As that's about all. No matter getting the most expensive GFX too. Mid range is fine. Soon technology evolves and you'll end up with an uber expensive card that could still play games but won't have the latest tech.If you don't work with multicore enabled programs theres not much use to those octa and etc cores cpus too. Most programs are still run in single cores.Save some money for proper cooling. Having a silent PC IS NOT overrated. Once you try one, you won't ever ever again think about having one sounding like a jet engine.
Intel shills never provide any substance in their arguments, ever. They likely are trying to overcompensate for the money they feel they wasted.Amd users will always provide a clear, substanced argument because they did their research before making an important purchase.Intel does not provide the better price:performance ratio at any price point until you need to go way beyond normal use. If you have a job that requires a 6 core intel, youd know it , and could easily afford it. Otherwise just use your noggin. Find out exactly what you need out of your rig first, and make your desicions accordingly.

Here's some real-world use-case data for you.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AunYlOAfGABxdFQ0UzJyTFAxbzZhYWtGcGwySlRFa1E#gid=0This is popular (play GC/Wii games on your PC in HD, what's not to like), and compute intensive on one or two cores. So not a theoretical synthetic workload that magically spreads perfectly to many cores.Notice how much faster an i3-4130 is than an FX-anything. Notice how even a LAST-GEN i3 is faster than an FX-8320. Notice all the Intel MOBILE chips that are faster than AMD's offerings.Now, if your workload DOES spread well across many cores- video rendering?- and isn't FPU intensive- then I could very well see an AMD chip being a good fit for you. But for most real-world applications that people run- especially most video games- fewer, faster cores are vastly preferable to many slow ones.I know this because I did my research before making an important purchase.
Also get a decent 50$+ cooler. Really helps with overclocking headroom.
And you can overclock and still have a decent silent computer.It's all about management. Case, quality fans, cable management, fan speed vs temperature management. Can't stress how important it is to get a motherboard that supports these functions so that you don't end up having to deal with shit programs like speedfan.
I think the 8320e (higher binned for low tdp) instead of the 6300 I personally have an earlier 8320 @3.5 undervolted and it runs just about everything smoothly with the exception of shit designed to make unreasonable cpu calls. Like physx and hairworks because nvijew Seriously though as soon as they fixed games that made ridiculous amounts of physx calls on the cpu nvidia went out and made them add more.Anyway I don't think I'll be upgrading until zen and the nvidjew shit could be fixed if you went and got one of their cards. (y'know if you want to have them be able to afford more of this crap)But thats just from the AMDSPECTIVE™ It is probably a good point to get a lower end intel chip as long as the price is reasonable but if it's going to cut into your graphics card budget , assuming you game , always get the best single card if unsure.
So, what's the solution? Intel are jews, AMD is garbage. How do we solve this?
Incineration is the answer to both.
Really? I play dolphin super smash bros brawl with 4x msaa and 2.5x native res and never dip below 50 fps which is the cap for that game. And im using an hd 7870. Youre right dolphin is popular and uses two cores, in that case the intel will do better.  But did it occur to u that maybe, just maybe, it's not all that stressing on any modern cpu?
HMy point is the fx will hold its own in these cases, while excellening in intensive tasks where an i3 will simply crumble OP if you need to play dolphin at 16x msaa and 5x native res, and thats the most stress your pc will see, go for the i3. If you intend to anything intensive, dont bother with it and get the fx
This is sadly true, but intel or AMD now is not the time to buy. If zen is a worldbeater, then great buy that but if you wait and see until after that, intel might well throw out a new amd beating cpu soon after. You really do lose buying now, you lose doubly buying a an AMD chip literally in its death cycle.
Wait for Via to catchup :^)

The sooner the stuff is in your hands the sooner you get to use it. Inn business that can be critical. Waiting for the next-big-thing is a fool's game.
It depends on what sort of games you play. I returned a 144hz monitor recently(that Acer IPS) because in part because it really didn't feel any different to me. Felt it in games like Counter Strike, but I don't spend nearly enough time with those sorts of game to make it worth my while.
>Inn businessWe'll leave the light on for you
When I saw 295, AMD was not what came to mind.
I get that argument, but the 300 series is literally less than month away.
I've heard that monitor had horrible g2g values so the 144Hz effect is diluted. Unfortunately IPS still isn't up to such high refreshes.

Also getting constant connection errors and "you must fill out the captcha to be verified," after I have been verified, and after they make me tell them a hamburger is actually a street sign.How is this captcha service acceptable on a site that participated in the SOPA blackouts just two years ago?

changed to 4790k and downgraded ram. price now 3100. cheers
-drop powersupply to something lower, go bronze if you need to-drop to DDR3 and optionally 16GB of Ram-drop to a single card and possibly better card, fuck SLI no reason to pay double for 10% more performance, and 100% more hassle.-drop the spinning drive..286 is too much for a 1TB spinner, secondly you really dont need it.  That price on the Samsung 850 has you at what 750GB maybe 1TB?  Thats all you need.-drop mother board, you can find something with the exact same features for half that price, especially a DDR 3 board-drop processor to something more reasonable, again no reason to pay double for slight performance gains.-drop liquid cooling, un necessary, your rig will be more than fast enough at stock speeds...if you need to push it at all, push it as far as you can go with air and stop, anything more is just autism

However, I can't get it to work on my PC even though it should be compatible with Windows systems (says on the product info and other users). The device installed just fine, but somehow the controls won't respond when I do the calibration tests. Any help please?

Lol public trackers have nothing when it comes to tv. All they have is shitty xvid avis that are barely seeded.Can you mega it for me bro? I don't really want to join another tracker when I've already joined so many tv trackers that have maybe 1 thing I actually want.
If you have access to private trackers, you have a moral duty to reupload to public trackers.By putting up with byzantine rules and regulations to share content with others, you martyr yourself for the good of mankind.Fight copyright.

IPTnot all of us are bad
I doubt tracker databases are encrypted since the software would have to decrypt it to do I/O and the keys would be close by anyway.What other security measures do you/trackers in general employ?
I think IPT is only hated on r/tracker honestly, and by hated I mean people will just post the same "IPT is the worst PTP is the best" to get comment karma
If you're running gazelle?Prayer.

What the fuck? I thought What.CD was autistic abour security. So it's not really any better than anything else?
that's a lot of delusion all wrapped up in one shitpost
The only fucking security ANY of these trackers have is through obscurity. It's fucking ridiculous.
Don't fall for the "le gazelle is bad" meme. It's just aza shitposting.
Lol I was expecting the software to be sophisticated on that front or something. If that's the case anyone could write their own tracker and still end up with something as secure as Gazelle. I hear a lot of shit about reverse proxies but that's apparently an Nginx thing.So why the fuck does everyone put up with hacking on Gazelle's shitty PHP codebase? Why did it take ToTV to innovate something new? Gazelle is not even that good.
It's like babby's first project. He thinks gazelle is so shit yet the competition is just so horrible that there's no true alternative
>Why did it take ToTV to innovate something new?people are very lazy and if something already exists, they will use it instead
Well then, how secure is it? Do you know? I started browsing the source yesterday out of curiosity, starting by the database schema. All I've seen so far were attempts to deproxify users.
You have clearly never worked with gazelle
Because for the most part, it's just changing the hardcoded shit (literally almost everything) to variables. Once that's done, it's much easier to organise shit. TBDEV doesn't even come close so people don't bother with that. Making your own frontend is bothersome; you have lots of boilerplate to set up, you need coding guidelines, a dedicated team that won't fizzle out after 3 days etc etcOh and yeah, reverse proxies are literally routing 1 VPS to another until they hit the root server. Great security there, 312cuck.
Put your trip back on, fagtron.
What is wafflesfm/batter
>oh no people are calling me out on being an idiot I better insinuate that they're the same person
So you have a more customizable version of gazelle? Have you released it on Github?Anyway I seriously doubt all that database shit can be abstracted away. PHP sucks at it and the models depend directly on the schema.
I have. It's shit, hardcodes as far as the eye can see, but much better than trying to mould TBDEV to your liking. 0day sites are great for TBDEV but if you want any semblance of organisation then gazelle is sadly the only option.You're going to come across posts form 312cuck and co. that state they have elaborate anti-cheater/security mechanisms that they can't go into.Hint: it's fucking nothing. Scripts that cross-reference downloads from new users with ones from banned users to ascertain their tastes. Little shit like that. Their cheating scripts are just laughable. Fire up mRatio and use memory reader with a client of your choosing and go ahead and cheat on a decently active torrent and see if you get banned. If you did it right (e.g didn't set your upload at 50MB/s from a residential line, didn't cheat 5TB in 20 minutes etc) then watch as they go about and still claim they have good scripts.
>How do I join GGN?Recruitment on other trackers. Become PU on WCD, that's basically the best way of getting into any tracker you might want to be in.>Is there a healthy cracking/development community there?Depends on what you mean by that. If you mean whether or not they have good threads on these topics in their forums, no. Private trackers have notoriously shitty forums. I mean they are all basically just gated community populated by people who want to get shit for free and most of the userbase is barely active in any way. As a result the communities tend to be ghost towns filled by morons, assholes and autists.

threadly reminder that no matter how big your epeen is, you'll never get into OppaiTime
Yeah I asked about those "methods" here once and the results were hilarious. People on this board think security through obscurity is effective.Their historical cross-referencing methods are evident from the database schema and IRC logs. Statistical methods are an obvious solution as well.I don't think the bittorrent protocol allows this but the way to prevent cheating is to track actual traffic between peers instead of just the peers themselves. That way you can verify that a client is downloading the same amount another is uploading with high specificity. The tracker relies on clients telling them about their activities like an idiot. It's really a hint that everything should be ratioless anyway.It's like a tax evasion detection system. Bittorrent and economics have so much in common.
Go and Java have automatic code formatters and official coding styles.
You just defined majority of reddit.
What.CD devs had guidelines and it didn't seem to help much...
sorry bud, but I've never had a reddit account. the ipt hate is pretty justified tho. you seem to know quite a lot about all the reddit drama yourself, so maybe you're the one that needs to go back.
They don't.They really don't.The programming style is all over the place in gazelle.
But it says right on their github readme that they have one. Good lord.From your description I'm almost chalking this up as PHP code monkeys.
The protocol doesn't allow that because peers are promiscuous by nature; they'll seed to anyone. Combine that with dropped pieces and discrepancies between announcing and transferring data due to power failure etc, you can see how the data would be unreliable as fuck.But yeah, the security these trackers like to think they have is no more than simple cross referencing from banned users and basic scripts to check discrepancies between client id reporting, speed vs the availability of internet packages in that area, music/movie tastes with banned people etc.There was a pastebin from the autistic admin of WCD who basically confirmed all this by telling a suspected trader that they check the writing style on the forums with previous users as well as music tastes. Seriously fucked up. They're storing all this data too while deliberately hardcoding the IPs of the mods as 127.0.0.1 (check gazelle source)
mutracker (other anon isn't me)
Yeah, in my opinion the bittorrent protocol just wasn't designed for this ratio stuff.How would a tracker detect client ID spoofing? It's literally a string you can change yourself.Yeah I saw all the IP history tables in the Schema. They probably automatically alert staff if the geolocation doesn't match. The staff IP hardcoding is retarded. Harder to detect a compromised staff account like what happened to Emp.
>How would a tracker detect client ID spoofing? It's literally a string you can change yourself.Each client produces a certain pattern like a fingerprint. If that fingerprint doesn't match the reported client, you're banned. However, cheating tools are so advanced that they extract the fingerprint from the running client's memory and sends that too which gets past all their shit.Fun fact, in many places rtorrent isn't even on any anti-cheating scripts as it's almost impossible to extract the fingerprint as it changes it for every torrent added, so cheaters can't masquerade as them and trackers don't need to worry about them.But you can change the source code to report a higher upload than normal, top lel.
>reverse engineering gazellethread saved. based oppai time staff giving information
simple spoofing doesnt do the randomized peer idthats why the good ratio spoofers have a memory reader which reads a legit client's unique peer id and replicate it for their fake up/down
Fingerprints? Are you talking about behavorial patterns of the client? So you have a data on how each client behaves given each and every torrent engine, client and setting combination, including closed source clients?You're trolling me, right?
>based oppai time staff giving informationAs much as I'd love to take credit, neither I nor my staff have been posting this shit.The only thing I've been doing is talking shit on WCD.
what did they actually improve over base gazelle? It looks like /g/tracker except pink
Don't know what a random peer id is. Can you englighten me?
I worded that wrong, i meant to say peer id, but overall it's like a fingerprint (peer id + client id would almost always be unique to a certain client)
What determines this peer id? The tracker? The client itself?
Check out SBI forums. They're a ratio cheating place but i genuinely learned so much shit from there. It's unbelievable how tracker staff can still claim they can detect this shit.Well, technically they can detect the retards who don't set up everything correctly.
>tfw ratio cheating on all the big trackersI can't believe people actually put in time instead of just cheating on these autistic trackers with no possibility of getting banned
What if you trigger their autism one day with all your shitposting about their software?
The clientAlso good luck to them trying to catch me fake seeding massive files that i fake downloaded, for bonus points, which i convert into upload.
What are they gonna do about it?
send the what.autism hit squad to your basement
let say you have your Peer ID for utorrent its gonna be something like UT3001, the number being the version number.or deluge being DE1311 somethingbefore those idents you have a string of characters that are randomly generated by your client.The trackers don't have a list of all the randoms of course, but they match them because the strings are usually unique in lenght per clientlets say deluge has 5 randoms before the peer idif you just spoof the client you will change the DE1331 part with lets say UT3001, but not the randoms, hence detection.
Sprout tentacles and rape your tight little asshole.
forgot to add .im sure you are asking yourself why would you change the peerid of a client, its not usefull well lads, because back in the days there were only certain modded clients that could do modified upoload and download, and those had the same peer id, especially for the utorrent or Azureus versions that can be detected by every new iteration, so connecting with those clients was auto ban.then came the standalone softwares that could do it without actually upping or downloading anything, but the peer id was the problem because they were not actually the client, and so they could'nt pretend 100% to be what they appeared to be memory reading is the best solution and cannot be detected. trackers play on the " we have secret systems that you don't know about" , but realistically they can't do shit.people that get caught just mess up their behavior by-upping on torrents where there is no peers and no one else uploads-uploads too fast for their country/provider
So why can't one look at the client source code, find the method it uses to generate the unique peer id and copy it verbatim to your cheating program?
>people that get caught just mess up their behavior by-upping on torrents where there is no peers and no one else uploads-uploads too fast for their country/providerThis. Uploading at 30MB/s from a residential line in the UK where the realistic max is 1.5MB/s right now (Virgin Media) or around 6-7MB/s (depending on where you live with BT). Also, uploading on an almost dead torrent with 2 seeds who have not seen any activity in weeks, then you pop up and start uploading at 30MB/s to no one at all.
No, the public trackers are fine.
uTorrent source? You technically could, but it's far easier to memory read it as even the tiniest error in your implementation could mean a ban.
well the main client, Utorrent is closed source, the utorrent hacks were just hex hacking, nothing muchits much simpler to detect the running process of whatever client your are running and extract whats from it.
You could look at the source of any of the many, many free software clients that are whitelisted, including well-regarded clients like rtorrent.Hell you could embed the program into them.
Yeah sure, it should be pretty simple, but let's pretend it was impossible for the sake of determining the lower bound of staff effectiveness.
rtorrent randomises peer id everytime you add a new torrent so it's not worth it. Also, it's mostly used on seedboxes
yes you could, but you don't seem to have an idea of the time and effort for this strategy
I use rtorrent in my home... Anyone that uses *nix and doesn't use it is not very smart.
Eh, it's easier to use qbittorrent or deluge for me.
You shouldn't even fake upload to begin with, you'll eventually fuck up one day cause you got other things to do and you left the program fake uploading for too long when there's no one downloading. Just fake download it and keep it seeding for bonus points to exchange.
God damn it man, just automate it. The client can count the number of seeders and leechers, can't it? Make it stop when leechers == 0.
That's what i do. The only time i've faked upload is during big events like AHD's Nimoy freeleech where i faked roughly XTB without getting caught. Otherwise i keep it locked down with BP.
So trackers basically put proxies between themselves and their users and call that security.Am I correct in assuming the only reason nothing happens is because nobody gives enough of a fuck?
Straight up.
>he thinks the tracker admins don't sell user information to anyone who wants it

>all those oppai time torrentsThanks staff. This shit is gonna be bigger than e-hentai one day.
btpd (pipeable and scriptable) is more *nix-style than rtorrent (ncurses shit).
can we even upload all the kind of stuff that's hosted on e-hentai though? I Don't recall ever hearing if stuff like game cg or doujinshi is allowed.
Rules don't seem to be set in stone yet. Plenty of games in there. There seems to be plenty of doujinshi as well?Make a suggestion in the forums. Personally, I'd like unzipped versions of stuff like it's on AB.

>tfw less than 100 GB on seedboxptp pls
How much you seeding?
On PTP? 215 GB combined seedbox and home seeding size.
lel, my lowest is 750GB. Highest 4TB
Well I don't have that much storage. Yet.Why? Before I expand my storage, I need to look into backups. I've been talking to Backblaze about it. Seems they'd be too happy about eating 10 TB of data from my computer. But how would I get it back when my shit inevitably crashes?
You don't backup torrent contents, if you care you just download them again.
My ratio wouldn't survive that.
>This shit is gonna be bigger than e-hentai one day.I wouldn't bet on it, "e-hentai" generates over $20k/mo revenue.
... Holy shit.
how in the fuck. that ponyfucker is getting rich off anime porn
>Personally, I'd like unzipped versions of stuff like it's on ABHalf the "unzipped versions" of stuff on AB doesn't even work properly, especially games/VN's.
I was talking about manga. For games, I prefer disc images and such.
>unzipped mangaI'm being fucking trolled by the Oppaitime staff aren't I?
No? What's wrong? Literally a directory full of ordered pictures. Incidentally, that's what a zipped file represents.
>Literally a directory full of ordered pictures
>animeYou have no redeeming qualities, you should do that to yourself.
I don't understand why you're getting so upset at what he's saying. Try using words instead of reaction images, and maybe you could actually get a coherent point across.
AB allows it. That's how your music files are organized, by the way. Are you actually going to explain your autism or just shitpost?
Please don't defile the cuteness of moe with your psychological addiction to aggression.No, he's not going to explain. He just enjoys being a little shithead and annoying everyone. He's a special kind of attention whore.
Holy shit, for a second I forgot I was on /g/ not /a/, you might actually need this explaining to you:Comic viewers on windows don't suck, unlike Linux were you're stuck with the god awful MComix.
I don't use comic viewers.
>the comic viewer I use can view zips therefore zips are superiorHow about fuck off
And that's the difference between you and people that actually download and collect manga.
I have plenty of manga, and I haven't used a comic viewer since like 2004 or 2005. Not everyone like to use them, and I'm still not really sure why just having both versions uploaded is such a big deal. Why should it only be the format you like?
What do you use? I only know cdisplay
So what's the problem? Your program can load a zipped file but can't load a directory full of of ordered images, which is what is inside the archive? My image viewer can do this. Why can't your fancy "comic book" viewer do it?You realize it's the same thing, right? Only zipped files have worse compatibility because it's a binary blob. They also have less granularity.The only advantage of zipped files is that you can treat an entire directory tree as if it was a single file. Useful if you want to upload it somewhere.So the difference is you're not just dumb but also annoyingly autistic and he's not?
How long did you guys have to wait for your BTN invite after you requested it?
3 months
>Useful if you want to upload it somewhereOnly useful if you're not using bittorrent
>Your program can load a zipped file but can't load a directory full of of ordered images, which is what is inside the archive? My image viewer can do this. Why can't your fancy "comic book" viewer do it?There's no need to get upset Anon. It isn't my fault your Timesink OS doesn't have comparable applications to mine.
Zipped files result in less wasted I/O.
like a few hours. this was nearly 4 years ago tho

So you don't actually have an argument. Got it.
They've never actually opened a 900+ page anthology.
Yeah. Rapidshit and friends, sending files through Facebook, etc.I use Windows and Honeyview3. It supports loading your zips but I still prefer folders.

that's nuts. Wonder how many MLP plushies that fagboy buys with all that extra money
Are you people actually going to explain some shit or what? Most good image viewers out there will pre-load all images in the immediate sequence.I never had any issues but fuck, if you're so thirsty for I/O performance, use a fucking SSD, or copy all your manga to a RAM drive before you read them.For some reason I don't see any autism about zipping up music albums, where the files are much larger.
You dense motherfucker.Zipped folder = saved space = more storage = less bandwidth needed = less I/O caused by writing pictures due to viewers extracting to memory and not diskIf you prefer folders, then carry on sucking that dick, cuck.
He's a fucking faggot but you can't deny he's smart, H@H is pretty clever and the guy works at a top 100 company as a senior engineer.
>Zipped folder = saved space = more storage = less bandwidth needed = less I/O caused by writing pictures due to viewers extracting to memory and not diskWow, 1 MB of saved space per zip. That's literally the difference in size between archived and unarchived versions of every single torrent I've seen on AB to date.You realize pictures (and music, and video) are already compressed using highly specialized algorithms and running a second highly generalized algorithm over it isn't going to give you significant improvements, right?
oh, for sure. not denying that at all.
>Wow, 1 MB of saved space per zipUnlike you fucking normies, some of our collections are hundreds of GB
Pro-tip: modern operating systems are multithreading, a single large .zip gets uploaded to cache faster than 30 smaller .jpg files.
>They haven't past the TB line yetdo you even archive?
Wow, a whole gigabyte saved at the cost of convenience.I have fucking terabytes of this shit, mate.But do you read 30 pages at once?
>only hundreds>calling others normies
>1TB of mangaUnless you have a mangatraders backup you'll never reach that amount.
lmao you guys have transcended normies and become ultra autists
>Unless you have a mangatraders backupI actually do run one of the /a/ backups.
If i'm encoding a season of tv, do i have to adjust settings for the first ep or do i have to do it for each one? how long would it take if i'm trying to do a good job for mkv transparency.
Madokami or you're one of the guys that archived mangatraders? I haven't been to /a/ for a while.
Each episode m8
where do I download these backups
who got the invites for karagarga.net?
>saved space = more storagestorage is literally unlimited nowadays you cuck, nobody cares>less I/O caused by writing pictures due to viewers extracting to memory and not diskwith folders the pictures are already extractedyou only load the one you're actually reading and perhaps the next and previous ones if you want "performance"
Do it anon
me
make a torrent of it man, I'll love you forever
After PMing the BTN recruiter, how long did you guys wait for his email?
3 months, i fucking told you before.
make a torrent of what exactly?
Stop lying.
About three months
He's not lying you dumb fuck.
Usercap is reached homo, it used to take 6 months right after it happened but after some pruning, more space opened up. However, the backlog seems to be 3 months as the usercap gets reached quickly and you have to wait for the next prune. Now fuck off.
Both of you are lying. It takes a week or less.
Can someone tell me why the fuck all my ggn torrents say error right now?
They have gone over the userlimit so you are lying. Fuck off.
All my oppai torrents are error too.
Tracker is having issues. Just sit tight and keep them running.

my oppai torrents are fine. I'm guessing GGn is just the usual tracker issues that have been ongoing.
lel
it begins. this is why you never post on tracker forums, nerds.
So Azathoth became hitler like all other tracker staff?Well, it was a fund ride but i'm jumping this site.
Why did PTP lower their user limit?
>So Azathoth became hitlerNo, that was me
I'm willing to bet this wasn't even Azathoth, Spaghetti is the autistic one but I don't think he posts here any more after being doxed.
>warned for a flamewar starting postNo, he handled it exceptionally well. Look at the autism above.
for what purpose
x264 settings will largely stay the same, unless you notice a specific section it's destroying.  For example, rain is often smeared to oblivion on settings that otherwise look great, so you may have to mess around with AQ and qcomp, and turn off any denoisers.It isn't a time issue since CRF is pretty much CRF, it's a size issue.  Slower encoding settings save space.Anime can benefit going all the way to 16 b-frames and 16 ref frames, though I wouldn't argue with 12 or 10.
>became hitlerCan you please not reddit up this thread? We love Hitler. He is the greatest man of the 20th century. Do not fall for Jewish propaganda.
Having shit opinionsIt's not like I banned him. He got warned. It does literally nothing except prevent you from ascending user classes, which don't do anything right now anyway.It's lighthearted I swear
>Having shit opinionsThis is the prevailing opinion on /a/.
CorrectAnd your point?
>states the truth>flamewarPls>this post>this numbersShit, i have to agree. But i'm a chink so Hitler would eventually kill me too.It starts lighthearted and then you do like 312c, kane and fubar and starts powertripping like there is no tomorrow
>/a/ opinion>anything resembling authorityLol.
that doesn't mean it's not shit. what fucking point are you even trying to make with this statement lmao
>your silly preference>truthLol
Who do you think are the target audience of yellow fever the tracker?
>/a/'s opinionhahahaha
>i'm a chink so Hitler would eventually kill me too.Hitler didn't even kill Jews for being Jewish. He killed anybody who attacked his people. Read about Hitler from a non-Jewish source for once in your life and you will find yourself rewarded with knowledge as to how the world really works.
I haven't visited /a/ since the rebuild of evangelion generals.
people that like anime porn. now explain to me what the fuck that has to do with archived files
Chinks are never satisfied with what they have so we would eventually clash with germany. But i doubt throwing a billion people against a technology advanced country would work.
>and then you do like 312c, kane and fubarAll I know here is that 312c is staff at PTP (I think). Are these guys all known power trippers or something?Anyway I promise this is as bad as I get. It's not my first rodeo.Just because our target audience holds a crappy opinion in favor doesn't mean we're going to support it. Archives are absolutely stupid for image and video torrents because they require you to either keep two copies of the same data (one archived for seeding and one unarchived for actual use) or limit you to only using software with zip viewing.If this was a general tracker, we wouldn't allow 60 part rars either just because the scene loves that
empornium will probably have it honestly
Kane is at GFT and fubar is at x264
>Archives are absolutely stupid for image and video torrents because they require you to either keep two copies of the same data (one archived for seeding and one unarchived for actual use) or limit you to only using software with zip viewing.>If this was a general tracker, we wouldn't allow 60 part rars either just because the scene loves thatLove you man
I've never heard of either of those trackers.Unless fubar is a developer of the x264 encoding library and I'm misunderstanding something here.
>we wouldn't allow 60 part rars either just because the scene loves thatThis person runs your private tracker /g/, congratulations, you've finally found somebody more inept than the GGn staff.
I don't run it. I'm just in charge of dealing with retards
>never heard of gft or x264Meh, they are other trackers and those guys guys think they are gods because they can ban people.
someone make a new thread already FUCK
Do it yourself FUCK
i cant be bothered fuckhead
Fuck yourself you fuck
say that to my fucking face motherfucker
I'll fuck your fucking faggot face you faggot fucker
if you fuck my face then that makes you the faggot you fucking faggot
420 blaze it phaggot
get moving faggots
Hey /g/, I want to start learning Python, but I found out that there are 2 editions of Python? Do they have any noteable differences, and if so, which one is better?
3.x is betterEveryone uses 2.7Use 2.7
2.7
3.x
3 changed some things but no one uses 3 because devs backport all the updates from 3 to 2 anyway. It's a really stupid problem honestly.
If you are learning then go with 3
Learn 3.xIf you are gonna build something new use 3.xIf you are gonna extend something in 2.7 use 2.7
Use 3.x, it is the future. 2.7 is slowly being deprecated. The only people that use it are being forced to use it because other things use it.
Do you want to learn it for work or for yourself ?Work : 2.7Yourself : 3
learn 2, it's easier to switch to 3 from there.
nothing really different besides slight changes to syntax so it basically the same,go with 3Read this: http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy.pdf
http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdfopps here a more updated book
The differences is small enough that you shouldn't get worried.Instead, get recommended, or go find your own book/tutorial, then use whatever they use in the book. or don't, it literally doesn't matter one bit.
>Programming books>Just a bunch of monkey see, monkey do>They don't explain what functions do
Yeah mostly, but it's nice to have reference material when you don't have a hugeass monitor.>They don't explain what functions do.If you're really learning then you're supposed to figure a lot of that out on your own, not get it from one source, otherwise it's "just a bunch of monkey see, monkey do," but more verbose.
faaaag
No.
>2015Just use 3. You are not gonna need anything that only has a 2.7 version, and if you do, there's probably a better alternative in 3.
They don't explain what functions doThat's what the reference documentation is for. Do you want a book to simply copypastes docs.python.org?
don't be a homo and learn 2.7
:(Which part? If you're not looking up and experimenting with new functions on your own then you're going to be shit at remembering anything you learn, and probably shit at implementing anything besides whatever muh "learn x-language the hard way" taught you. I'm not saying you should be looking at just function names and figuring the rest out on your own; books should definitely give the rundown on what a function is meant to do and how certain data structures should be used/interpreted, but anything more and your hand is being held.
By the time you're reasonably competent, 2.7 will have been phased out.
Keep reading a lot about kepler and nvidia not supporting it/sabotaging it leading it's performance to be worse than the 200 series amd card in games that use gameworks. Or shit like a 960 beating out a 780. The 700 series was shitstomping amd pre gameworks so what exactly is going on? Can anyone clarify?
its called 'planned obsolesance' and Kepler owners got fucked by the very company they devoted so much shit posting in favor ofpottery
Its just fud and lies OP. Nvidia would never do something like that since it would hurt business. They know better that that.
>implying Nvidia doesn't look at their legion if idiotic fanboys as cashcows
Who cares about Irrelevant GPUs?
I just want to know where all this is leading since I do plan to upgrade to pascal eventually but now I feel like keeping my eye on what happens to the 900 users in time because I can't upgrade as often as I'd like. Then I dig into it a bit more and see this already happened before witcher 3 and in other games that use gameworks (according to their users on their forums) but no one has done or said much which is why I'm now a bit confused and worried. All you really have to do is stop by the 600/700 official nvidia forums to see users complain about it all.
Gameworks is cancer in general
After the 970 fiasco, do you really think that they'd worry about their actions hurting their business? They're banking on people doing marginal upgrades. The blind faggots just see benchmarks of Kepler performing bad thinking it's way past its prime and not because Nvidia can choose when they want to make something obsolete. Which makes them go out and buy another card because they need "the best" and Nvidia is banking on that. Besides, Nvidia has always stopped giving a shit about drivers for their old cards. It's only natural that they move up from neutrally dropping support to a negative with planned obsolescence for gayworks gaymes.
the 7XX series were always weaker than the AMD cards, nvidia active sabotage anything that isn't their latest cards. Now they are sabataging 7XX cards as well as AMD. Have fun in a year when they are sabataging maxwell too and the titan x is weaker than the 290x too.
The likelyhood is that nvidia simply fucked up. Because that wouldn't be unprecedented considering how bad they've fucked up before.
>like that since it would hurt business>nvidia >knowing how to business >The company claims that their OEM income is only a tiny part of their overall revenue. >A bit over a year ago this wasn’t true, Nvidia was overwhelmingly dominant in OEM design wins for GPUs from Apple to no name players.>What changed over the past year or so? Do you think that Nvidia suing or threatening nearly 100% of their OEM customer base with a patent trolling lawsuit had anything to do with losing business there?https://semiaccurate.com/2015/05/11/nvidias-q12016-analyst-call-three-unusual-themes/
But they would have fixed it back in project cars. They just simply don't care and it will take another round of screwing over 900 users to get people riled. I'd be pretty angry if I got a 780 ti or some shit but I'm a poorfag who upgrades once every 4-5 years so what do I know. I do however play my upgrades carefully and have been nvidia for a bit so this is disgusting
