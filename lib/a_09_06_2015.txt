Just finished watching Serial Experiments Lain, can we talk about it?
I want to sniff Lain's cute butt.
Sure what did you think about it?
1Do you have an actual thing you want to discuss or do you just hope other people will start discussing something so you can watch?
4woah end of the mature discussion.
5Well it was obviously really weird and didn't try to make much sense, but I still liked it. To me, it felt like Satoshi Kon made a series about people in the Matrix. That paranoia, and questioning of reality and whatnot seem to match their style. Now sure if all the repeated scenes were stylistic like what was going on in perfect blue or if there just wasn't a huge budget and they were running out of ink.
2Column A and B. Still processing it so I want to see what others have to say on it while throwing in my 2 cents
The unsettling, foreboding atmosphere in Lain was one of my favorite parts. I'm going through Texhnolyze, and while it's good, it just doesn't have the same appeal.
3I loved the contrast in a lot of the earlier episodes. Everything was super bright and washed out, but shadows and stuff would be black and have those swirling effects on it. Definitely did a good job establishing that there was something not right about Lain and the world she inhabits
3Some themes are similar but expecting Lain when watching Texhnolyze is not the thing to do. Texh is much more graphic compared to Lain.
I probably nodded off 6 times when I watched it the first time. Not boring, just quiet and slow. Music was nice too.
1The constant buzzing of the wires was a nice touch as well.3I realize that now. It's still pretty enjoyable.
8MatrixI was really surprised how similar the computer set ups looked to the Matrix designs, and that Lain came out a year before the first matrix film
I really liked the somewhat retro computing feel of everything. It definitely had a good comfy vibe when it wasn't being unsettling.

Anybody know of literature that has anything to do with Lain? like inspiration?
6is the PS1 game good? I have a hard time imagining what it would be like
It's hard to convey Lain's achievement because we have to talk about it in the context of the modern era.Lain was made in the mid to late 90's when almost all computers had to rely on slow modem dial up service and the only things that connected to the internet were PCs and they had to use wires. Network gaming was starting to happen in IT firms and college campuses, but the idea of the 'information superhighway' seemed to be overblown tech daydreams.Lain came out in that era and it fucking predicted the modern world from Wi-fi to iphones to broadband to internet meetups and buit a very engaging, abstract and human story out of it's eerily prophetic vision of the future.Having seen it in the nineties and now seeing what has come to pass I am stunned at just how much Lain was living in the future and selling itself as 'Present day. Present time.'AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
9It's hard to convey Lain's achievement because we have to talk about it in the context of the modern era.Not really unless you're talking about actual, real life......What she did equates to transcendence, which a lot of people are doing that nowadays. Besides, we'll be beyond what she's done once immortality comes out and $ is available in the form of furthered lifespan. At least until the Seed AI and his robot fingers come and take care of all of that junk for us.Or kill us.Also I would say that the "Sprawl" trilogy from William Gibson would have been much, much more of even a "predictor" I believe you're using this word erronously for this type of thing. I mean that was a fucking while ago and people still call him the prophet of all of this.Fucking wireless Ono-Sendai headsets, man. Can't wait.you a funny guy ahn't chew?
0From what I understand, it's like a graphic novel with some cutscenes like this one that gives some background information that's not in the show.
3I really think the buzzing was what brought the atmosphere home, really did it for me. That and the powerline/blood imagery
0Wasn't there some news about a remake of the game?
8No clue.
0Isn't the game like an alternate reality, though?
Incomprehensible for the sake of incomprehensible. Great atmosphere, but once you peel back the layers of pretention, the plot is kind of boring as any plot with an omnipotent protagonist is bound to be.
2I don't agree. The plot isn't about power levels or something, so her omnipotence is not an issue. It's about Lain discovering herself and the interaction of the digital and real worlds.
3Texhnolyze is a show you need to marathon while depressed.Its only purpose for existing is to drag your mind to the depths of hell.
It's basically Gnostic Cyberpunk, and I couldn't be happier about that.
Which is better? Lain or Texhnolyze? I loved Lain but I don't know what to expect from the other one. I've heard very good things about it. How's the story compared to Lain's?
8Seriously, the atmosphere in pretty much everything Abe is similar but they're all quite different. Texhnolyze and the whole surface people bit as well as the fact that like literally every named character dies except that one train operator whose name I don't even know hit hard. That being said, renmei is what seriously makes me want to off myself and I'm not sure why. Maybe it's rakka's depression on top of the whole sinbound = suicide thing, plus the entire purpose of their existence being that they all died and the best they can now hope for is essentially achieving another death. The theme I think was redemption, but for me it totally backfired.Still my favorite anime
8Lain or Texhnolyze?I would say it comes down to taste. Personally I preferred Texhnolyze.
3The electric buzzing was easily the best part of the show. First time I saw Lain I was using headphones, man did I feel the atmosphere with that buzzing in my ears
8Awesome, I should expect good quality then. Thanks!
Lain predicts people will lose their sense of identify with the advent of the internetIt actually turns out that people are MORE of their true selves on the internet than anywhere elseYou fucked up

Have been rereading some OP arcs lately and I dont see how anyone can say the Jaya/Skypiea is not arguably the bestIt incorporates just about everything great about OP, even if it is pretty irrelevant to the bigger pictureintroduces blackbeard piratesidea of haki/mantracricket and his intertwining story with wiper and their respective ancestorsrepresenting a mans dream/will in all aspects which is One Pieces pretty much main focusEnel is great villain, seemingly invincible enemy, with "god complex"and overall just shows how the OP is just a creative great adventurewhat not to like?
3I don't know either, it's one of the best and everyone who dislikes it is a poopy-head.
3Skypia is fun and even the lead up is great. Montblanc's story always hits me hard.
it was an arc in between the Alabasta and the Eneis Lobby arc two of the most favored world-building arcs so naturally it felt kinda off to some people also that flashback seemed good by itself but kinda went on very long
3The only interesting villian was Enel.
1very longThis could only have been for those who read it weekly though, right?
1that isa very good point, honestly never thought about it in that lightI think it was a nice break from just your shonen quest to be the best and just a nice side arc just focused on adventure
3Cricket is one of the best side characters in that he fully embraces every theme of One Piece, inherited will, destiny, free will, dreams, romance, adventure, makeshift family, friendship, and manliness, plus he's one of the few that felt completely on the same wavelength as Luffy, when he cried tears of joy, not at fulfilling his lifelong quest or vindicating his ancestor, but because he knew Luffy and his friends were safe, it was so nice to see a minor character who felt as strongly about Luffy as he did for them.
5yeah I always thought it was spaced fairly well, its only like 2-3 chapters isnt it?8Enel was definitely one of the more interesting
0though Alabasta was the beginning of the quest and fans wanted morethey got it from Eneis Lobby that came after making Skypeia stick out like a sore thumbcould call it the Wind Waker of the series but that would imply that Eneis Lobby was like Twilight Princess that was Marineford
implying the filler arc where usopp helps the little girl build the firework wasn't the dopest shit ever.
Still want to know why Zoro was wearing goggles all of a sudden and what was the point of Luffy wearing the black wrist band and bracelet.
1They'll come back at some point, right? I know they're chasing mirages now but still.1Style.
1copypastabut very well saidHow do you all feel Dressrosa is coming together? I am looking forward to a reread once the arc is finished
5No it really felt like it dragged too long, both in the manga and the anime. Montblanc's history is fucking amazing though. As is Enel.Overall a decent arc unlike shitty Dressrosa.
3law needs to kill doffy, barto needs to join up.
1gogglesgoing up knockup stream and could come in handywhich they didblack wrist band and braceletnot sure
1The moon people and the winged people are integral to the lore, as shown by Enel's cover story, so it will retroactively become of great importance and world-building. The winged races originated from the moon and migrated to the blue planet centuries ago. This is pretty much fact, the following though is just my opinion.In fact I like the theory that the D is a symbol for half-moon, to signify descendants with both human and moon blood inside them, from the Lost Kingdom that was made possible by the cooperation of those two races.
3I've only reread bits of as the volumes have come out, but every time I have read a volume of Dressrosa, I've become convinced it's much better than I thought it was.7I'm going to disregard your opinions because I disagree with them.
0black wrist band and braceletbecause oda changes his characters clothes.
1He was wearing that for when he swam in the white sea.
7why is dressrosa so shitty?7and yes, quite clear luffy will win this fight but as all ways he will not deliver the killbut everyone wants his death and is only right law gives it to themb4 luffy convinces law not the kill him
1law uses shambles and swaps with luffyi told you i'd pull the triggeroda you glorious bastard you've done it again
Well look at the pic you just posted. It looks so off compared to other scenes from other arcs. Basically a bunch of pirates go into the sky and meet two groups of people, one made up of white people with angel wings and another based of Native Americans. Then they fight a group of villains that use concepts from Western European Christianity in an place that looks like a Aztec digging site. Skypiea was this jumbled mess of ideas that broke the flow between Alabasta/Water 7. But it was still enjoyable.
Who are you all most hyped for strawhats to fight?bb?kidd?Kuma/px0?kaido?I also believe the green bull will be first admiral to fall by luffy, the fact he hasnt been showe leaves to believe he will be an enemy to be hyped later on
8So,is Laffite a D. that awakened his moon genes?
6against or alongside the red hair pirates.either way shanks dies.
6but its an adventure, not a fluid boring storyand it builds the personalities of our major characters and gives a lot of insight into the crew and how they interact instead of the world they live in
2Zoro still mistrusted robin during this arc.he took a hit for her from enel because "the captain trusts her"good shit zoro, good shit.
2Like how Robin is a dumb-dumb who doesn't know anything about campfires?
0I can't remember. I think Zoro had them after the KnockUp Stream but before he jumped into the clouds and started swimming, 0Luffy literally didn't do anything but put on the wristband/bracelet before he/Sanji/Ussop left. Everyone else had on different clothes.
7Overall a decent arc unlike shitty Dressrosafuck that. Dressrosa isn't any worse than skypiea at the very least. I'd even say it's way better but that's my opinion. Skypiea is still a bit of a drag to read through, even though I think it's a good arc. Rereading Dressrosa is a blast to go through.
1he still changes the clothes from time to time. the wristband was probably something of some significance to oda.
0Nuh-huh, because the arc is weekly and that means it's badly paced and drags on forever!
08the arc is fine on reread.the tournament thing dragged on but i feel it was necessary.
6I know, I was being sarcastic.
6exactly
1I know, I was agreeing.
So how about that outfit Robin had during Skypiea? Slutty, stylish, or both?
7lil of bothI loved this arc with Robin cause its a change of pace to see an outsider traveling with the group and how she eases into being their crew
6wish I wasnt lazy to find that panel of the bonfire
3whats not to like?how about the fight between luffy and enel? lol lightening cant affect me bc im rubberSo? all of his rubber still should have completely melted
4Wow. It's like you're reading a fucking comic book.
6they went out of the way to bring the real world concept of electricity and insulators and applied it very poorly in what was supposed to be the final climactic fight of the arc
5No, they used cartoon logic. Like how Luffy can blow air into his bones through his thumb.
9the most anticipated fight in the arc went: lightning strike lol im rubber shitttttttttttttand somehows thats not a valid criticism?
4Wait, that's how the fight ended? I'm pretty sure that's just how we got the best reaction in the series, and that the fight only started afterwards. My mistake.
9the fight that followed was bullshit because lightening is highly effective against rubber
3No it isn't because cartoon logic. You know for a fact that almost everything that happens in the series, including the island of Skypiea existing in the sky, was bullshit, and this is what you get your autism irritated by?What's wrong with you?
3Skypiea was fucking boring. I've tried to get through it twice and I've dropped it midway twice.
4The entire arc was built for that moment. If you don't find a goldmine of entertainment and catharsis in seeing Enel utterly shit his pants in fear then there's no helping you.
3 Again it's retarded to bitch about op not following the real world If it dead everyone would be dead before reverse mountain...which also doesn't work with real physics
6Then one piece isn't for youSorry
3autism irritated?asked whats not to like?give valid answerequals autism somehow? i wouldnt pursue a career in psychology if i were you
Skypeia gets overlooked because it doesn't really advance the plot and goes on for a long time. The ultimate take away from the entire arc is that you're supposed to care about Robin because she's getting taken away next arc and that there are wonderful, adventurous things all over the world. It's a world building arc, and those aren't always the most readable. Plus the antagonist is a mustache twirler of the highest order.That said, it is a good arc, especially on subsequent readings. It builds the world very well and gives great character interactions and development. Plus the artwork is very well done.
3But your complaint isn't against Skypiea, it's against everything in One Piece or any other manga or other medium that doesn't follow real world physics.
3youre missing the point. its not about the physics its that the best fight in the arc was ruined because the creator didnt understand what he was writing
7No, skypiea is boring. Every other arc imo has been perfectly entertaining, as a matter of fact I loved Jaya, but the skypiea fights of "You'll die using that dial" as the character proceeds to use it multiple times gets old quick. Not to mention Enel lost before the fight even started knowing that luffy was rubber.
1for the record i liked skypiea fine, i just didnt like getting robbed of a real enel fight
It's a fun and great arc, still don't get why people skip it so much.It has a lot of adventure and a good chunk of focus on side characters. People who always look for fightings on One Piece are real cancer.
4didnt understandAnd I'm sure Oda also thinks you can blow air into your bones through your thumb or survive the kind of blood loss Zoro suffered during Alabasta or Thriller Bark.8but the skypiea fights of "You'll die using that dial" as the character proceeds to use it multiple times gets old quickGood thing it was only done by one character rather than in every fight.
6So did you just stop reading after that part or what? I mean the fight still happened, but you're acting like it didn't. Listening to you would leave someone thinking the whole thing ended in one page.
4But that's only because you are crying about the physics being not realistic?Whose to say oda didn't know how real world works since he isn't retarded and decided to say fuck it since it's a damn shonen manga?
0Good thing it was only done by one character rather than in every fight.Yeah still pissed me off beyond belief, but maybe I'll go through skypiea again and see if my opinion will change
0And I'm sure Oda also thinks you can blow air into your bones through your thumb or survive the kind of blood loss Zoro suffered during Alabasta or Thriller Bark never did i imply this anywhere obvious fantasy element are fine just dont try to bring in real world concepts that you dont understand and ruin the antagonist of an entire arc
7Dressrosa is far better than Skypia though
1I agree wipers survival is a little cheap, but we should know characters with strong will like that are the equivalent of being immortal in one piece
3Mock Town was fantastic, Noland's back story was great, and the sense of adventure was true to One Piece.However all of the villains besides Enel were completely forgettable, and the length combined with the pacing make it the most boring arc in my opinion.
5it didnt, enel was forced the fight w/o his devil fruit because of a bullshit premise
7trying to do real world conceptsReal world concepts like how magma is hotter than fire?4He still moved at the speed of lightning, used his electricity to remodel his blunt staff into a trident and moved through the gold of his ship.Which you should know. But you're going to pretend none of that happened because he didn't spam his epic lazzzor beamz.
4Confirmed retard
6luffy shouldnt have even been able to touch him, he had no haki and his fist would have literally melted if he hit enel
2would have literally meltedBut it didn't because he's made of rubber and therefore immune. What's so hard about this?
4But it didn't because he's made of rubber and therefore immune.What's so hard about this?because he's made of rubber and therefore immuneimmuneimmune to lightening lol
6Yes, you're getting it now.lolThat too, you're supposed to find some joy in this series, not take it apart panel by panel as you look for scientific inconsistencies.
1I love that they kept the Hercules beetle Luffy found and gave to them for two years.
4again i dont know how youre not understanding that it has nothing to do with scientific inconsistencies i just didnt like that he nullified enel's ability because of a faulty premise and since i was askedwhats not to like?i said something i didnt likei cant see why this is hard to understand
to be fair eneru not being able to use his DF was a cop out
4I don't understand how it's a cop out. Enlighten me.
6Crocodile lost cause apparently sand isn't sand when hit by water? And that didn't make yo u butt hurt?
6faulty premiseI can get you not liking how the fight went, but stop pretending you don't like it because you think there was something wrong with how the logic worked. Lightning doesn't affect rubber, end of story, that's how it works in the setting, the premise is not faulty because it's not real life.Just admit your real complaint is that you didn't get to see DBZ style lasers already.
2No, because that fight didn't involve laser beams. That's also why he isn't bitching about how Gear 3rd is impossible or how Skypiea even stays in the air. He doesn't care about things making sense, he's just too ashamed to admit that he wanted to see laser beams get spammed.
3Jaya is god tier on it's own
0this thread is about skypiea so im talking about skypiea also i barely remember Croc and dropped OP after skypiea years ago
4you're supposed to find some joy in this series, not take it apart panel by panel True. Sometimes I get the feeling that some people are just reading the series to find every single supposed flaw, inconsisty, frodos, plot holes or whatever and are not reading it for enjoyment purposes at all
5dropped OP after skypieaReally? Because the Davy Back Fight arc would have given you the thing you want most in this world. Beams.
0faulty premise nullifies main antagonists DF ruing the climatic fight somehow not a valid criticismsomehow not an asspulllol
6asspulland now I will disregard anything you say
4lol ill imply random assumptions that'll show him!!111!!1!
maybe because Enel vs Luffi is not as good as Luffi vs Crocs or vs CP9Skypea arc probably the most piracy things they ever done... let's seenew world depicted, Maya tribe likegold huntingjungle campingdeath match to the laststill prefer Alabasta tho
0But that's what the complaints were about.enel's not using his fruit!but he is, these are the things he did with his fruitNuh-huh, he didn't shoot da lazzor beams!That's really all it is.
9luffy is about to fight a lightening DFsuddenly somehow luffy is magically immune to lightening  not an asspull lol
5You know I once read a Spider-man issue where he beat up Electro by putting on a pair of rubber gloves and boots. This is how comics work. Deal with it.
Reading a manga about an MC is made of rubberFirst chapter and we 've already seen a man drive away a sea monster by staring at itCharacters can splits ships in half with tiny swordsCharacters can move faster that the eye can track or fly by hitting their legs fast enoughBlah,blah,blahComplain about a rubber man being able to withstand a lighting manThis is beyong bait,autism or even retardation.Anon is clearly lobotomized.
9i have a 250 IQ and am a well known one pieceologistcheckmate atheists
9It's what happens when you get science nerds following OP. The idea that a fictional world might not be like ours is absurd to them. They always need to apply real life physics, powerlevels or numbers on things if something doesn't make sense to them.
5lolfuck offalso in the opverse rubber is immune to lightening. that's the property that was given to luffy's rubber power. that property or rule hasn't been refuted yet in the story. how is that an asspull. or do you not know what the term asspull actually means?
5holy shit, you don't even know what an asspull is. you are so fucking retarded it hurts.
6luffy is about to fight a lightening DFsuddenly somehow luffy is magically immune to lightening despite that never having been established in OP or real life  not an asspull lol
6
8to signify descendants with both human and moon blood inside themWe Final Fantasy IV now?
6from googleAn Ass Pull is a moment when the writers pull something out of thin airlike rubber magically being immune to lightening the moment luffy is about to fight a lightening logia
2see6
7implying
6But rubber being immune against lightning is a well established fact in fiction! See for example0Or the times when Team Rocked put on rubber suits and Pikachu couldn't hurt them.
8Of course the final fight wasn't as good. It wasn't supposed to be. Luffy vs. Enel wasn't the primary purpose of the arc and ultimately had little consequences to the Straw Hats either way. The point of the arc WAS all that piraty shit and the sense of adventure.That's why Enels actions and motivation were so bare; because he was only a device to advance the Straw Hats through the last steps of the arc.
32 examples is a well established fact
6how many fuckings times do people have to tell your retarded, dense ass that cartoon logic is at work here. The lone fact that you are complaining that the things that happen in a fantasy setting full of exaggerated shit are going against real life physics or laws is so fucking baffling that I don't even know if you are trolling or not at this point.
9Do I need to find every single example and spoonfeed them to you, babby? You're wrong. Deal with it.
0wait, its not supposed to be real?
3The people discontent with it had to read it weekly.
0wait, is anime not real?
534Devil fruits make the eater gain qualities... Luffy is not literally rubber. If he was, he would be dead he still has blood, he still eats and breathes... but he is stretchy and resists electricity.If you eat a fruit, you gain an attribute. You embody it to an exaggerated degree. Luffy can stretch farther than any real rubber because he isn't rubber... he is "stretchy-ness" incarnate. He is electrical resistance incarnate.Either that or it's a cartoon-logic fueled adventure.
9and it will be the same with Dressrosa, just wait a few years
1I know it can be difficult to tell but no, it's not real.
3I found the fact that it was irrelivant to the bigger picture to be why it was so amazing. it was unexplored territory and was exactly what this adventure manga should be about.now its just super shichibukai, yonkou, and world government and shit. what the fuck ever.
0but its like based on real events right?
7Sure, that's why One Piece has so many historical figures in it.
I always thought the tournament part made it drag on more than necessary, but after a recent re-read, it was far shorter than I'd remembered it. I never felt any pacing issues while reading it, as all the chapters served a clear purpose. Definitely a top 3 arc for sure and had the best conclusion out of any arc.
5Right, like Donquixote and Rosinante. I learned about them in school.
6Yes, and Blackbeard and Lafitte and Sengoku Buddha. Of course the historical Buddha didn't have a goat because he became a poorfag.

36rubber acts an insulator against electricity. pretty sure that's a well known fact. it's used in pop media a lot and pretty sure that's where oda got his inspiration from. cause authors do that you know? he just exaggerated the property since it's a fucking cartoon. how is that a fucking asspull.

Skypiea is the best OP arc hands fucking down. Why there is no movie I don't fucking know.
7
3Oda draws some god tier reaction faces
3You're forgetting the middle. Skypeia has a great beginning, and a good end. But its middle is incredibly forgettable and has a lot of bad scenes that in the end nobody really cared about. Also it has so many fucking death scenes in a manga where nobody dies.
0They're on their own romantic quest. They don't need to show up really, they have a good ending as it is.
5They're on their own romantic questNotice how I mentioned it in my post. But I still want them to show up. Just being a fanboy here.
Personally, I am just so burnt out from it because back in school I used to watch One Peace in tv every afternoon and the Skypiea arc was reshown so many fucking times that it annoyed me.Kinda a Pavlov's dog effect I guess.
7Who forced you to watch it?
0My childish habit.
Anyone else feels like Doflamingo's power kinda does not live up to what you imagined him to be like? During the meeting of the shichibukai it was the hypest shit to see those new characters with that immense bounty and imagining what they could do. Doflamingo then controlled some people just for fun, and having characters so drastically OP is always a big "how will anyone ever reach this?" moment. But now he just kinda has strings. He does cool shit with that, sure, but it did not live up to the hype. Also, his former bounty of like 200 million is not that much anymore now.Guess that is the problem when shonens go so fucking long, the powercreep eventually overtakes the initially OP characters.Also I find it annoying how now most of Zoro's attacks are shooting a tornado or a flying slash, when before the time skip most of his attacks were pure sword fighting, and he very rarely shot a flying slash.I just got back into One Piece in this arc, so I might have missed a lot. Gear 4 is preddy cool.
4The first thing I assumed his power to be when I saw him control people was strings. He's more than lived up to the hype.former bounty of like 200 million340.might have missed a lotYou mean you skipped stuff? What the fuck? Get out of here and go read what you skipped.
4i thought doffy lived up to his hype for sure. with all the shit he's pulled and the fact that he's still standing. i see more people complaining that he's op at this point than the opposite.
4PULL THE STRINK! PULL THE STRINK!
4Everybody called it being strings back in the day, so not many people were disappointed by that.Zoro hasn't had to fight anybody in a real sword fight yet. He's been able to utterly dominate people and hasn't had a challenge. Until he does, he won't be doing much of the pure sword fighting.
4how now most of Zoro's attacks are shooting a tornado or a flying slash, when before the time skip most of his attacks were pure sword fighting, and he very rarely shot a flying slashhuh? i don't remember zoro doing any tornado or flying slashes?
1On Fishman Island he made a slash tornado, and he's done a couple flying slashes in Dressrosa. Otherwise all his fights have been either blocking, or in the case of Hodi/Monet/Pica/Hyouzou he defeated them in one slash. Granted his defeats of Monet and Hody are some beautiful shots, but I can get why he'd want more sword fighting when you compare that to his fights against Ryuuma and Kaku before.
4I just got back into One Piece in this arc, so I might have missed a lotsorry but only retards skip stuff
9You mean you skipped stuff? What the fuck? Get out of here and go read what you skipped.Yeah, I just kinda randomly dropped back in at this arc out of curiosity what was currently going on. I did not really plan to go back to One Piece, but I will do so now.And yeah, I know many people called him using strings, I heard that idea back then aswell. I guess it is just that in the beginning he seemed utterly untouchable. And now he is touchable. Kinda took the mystery out of him. But obviously that would just be a personal complaint.
You know what's One Piece's biggest flaw? There's no ship-to-ship combat. It's about pirates, there should be lots of that. I mean come on, they had the fucking Flying Dutchman in the series and there was no underwater fight between that and the Sunny? Damn you Oda!

0Dude, shut up and go read what you skipped. You've no business being here talking about stuff you don't even read! Shoo, shoo!
6must've forgotten the tornado slash on Fishman island. and i'm not really sure what you mean by flying slashes, but i was assuming one where he cuts with the air pressure or something? cause i don't remember any of that in dressrosa. i might be mistaken though.but anyway, it's pretty clear that zoro hasn't really been properly challenged yet. he barely broke a sweat cutting up pica and that was only because of all the running he had to do. I'm glad though, because that means he can challenge stronger opponents down the line, maybe even a yonko officer, without it seeming like too much of an asspull. Same with all the other strawhats.

So I just found out there's a spin-off to haruhi suzumiya no yuutsu. It's Nagato Yuki-chan no shoushitsu. I'm 30 seconds into the first episode and already it has pissed me off. I didn't realize that they could completely and utterly ruin a beloved character so fucking quickly. Please, /k/, tell me - does this anime redeem itself or should I burn it's existence from my memory?
/k/sorry already thinking of going commando on them for this one. /a/*
2It's becoming better and better.You will fall in love with this Yuki very soon.
/k/What?Anyway, this is as close as you're going to get to a haruhi S3 it starts out pretty shitty but it's gotten a little better, however most people have dropped it already.
90Thanks for the input. I'll give it a shot, but, god this is going to be REALLY tough to get into by the looks of it.
Where can I mail my vomit to as "feedback"?
HELLO /K/OMRADE HOW YOU STUMBLE ON CESSPOOL OF BOARD ANIME?I WAS ENCOUNTER ANOMALY IN FOREST WHEN SHITTING AND I WAS ANIME
0Lol. sorry pissed off = /k/ my wires got crossed. Feel free to keep the joke running, I deserve it.
5It gets better when alt-world haruhi enters the fray and Nagato basically shoshitsu's as advertised.
5at this point, the shoushitsu is going to be the best part. I'm over 15 minutes into the first episode and thinking, "wow, I suddenly find social justice warriors less offensive by comparison."
2P.S. I need alcohol to get through this one. why does my state have to stop selling alcohol this late? . I just finished my vodka off, but I didn't have enough left to even get a buzz.

6Thats because the jokes grow old. You aren't clever for making them again, or pointing out the fact that everyone used to enjoy them. Now please don't post here again.
Man, this thread fucking sucks. Hey, OP, it's a spinoff. It's going to be different, you fucking retard. Nobody cares. Kill yourself.
2Lol wasn't supposed to be a joke you double mongoloid. It always was nothing more than an abbreviation that tells that the poster was amused, nothing more, nothing less.And I probably posted here for longer than you in any case.

Just went back and rewatched this today. It remains an absolutely incredible piece of work. Fakir is my nigga.Who else remembers this shit?
0I watched it for the first time around 4 years ago. Fakir was so based I couldn't believe it, probably my favorite male anime character.
0Seriously, man. He's such a great execution with absolutely no bullshit. Leaped into my top ten right after the first season.
Great show, Fakir's development was really cool.
Friendly reminder that ducks breed through rape.I never did care about the Mytho. Scenes about him became almost painful at times.
0The characters were really likeable all around. Only problem is that it's over a decade old, so it's not like there's much room left for discussion.Neko-sensei was so fucking awesome. Also, dat ending.
1Mytho kind of exists to be a shoujo prince archetype so he can participate in a whole bunch of role reversals and twists on the genre. When you know what he's supposed to be, he's actually quite tolerable, especially in comparison to many of the characters he's essentially a jab at.
0020such fakir mindhusbando of the year all years
Real shame Princess Tutu never got more popular.
5I enjoy this kinda secret club.
0It's the far better version of Madoka.
Friend of mine had me watch episode one, skip the middle of the series and than watch last few episodes. Doesn't feel like I missed too much; the anime as a whole certainly has an artistic flare that I don't see too often but I'm still not sure how I feel about it.
5It was popular on LiveJournal back in the day.
I actually enjoyed the dub. However I don't know why they bothered casting the guy who played Mytho in that role. He sounded like a 40 year old man trying to sound bishounen. Everyone else was more or less great.

6Why is Ushio to Tora the best Shonen ever? I mean, that whole thing but seriously that ending. I take the chance of bumping to ask, if you don't mind, in case you know if the gaiden is ever going to be scanlated.
5
11While I wouldn't call it the best, I would say that it is very solid and uses a lot of things from that is common in shonen pretty well. It pulls a lot of things out of the book. The art helps as well. I'd say it's my favorite 90's weekly action shonen however.I dumped the last volume fo Gash Bell recently whcih sort of did the same thing, but I still feel that UtT just had a better all around fight.I've heard that the Gaiden is being scanned and a new chapter released somewhat recently
4More on the final fight, I think it helped that it wasn't really a "spell exchange", no Rasenshurikenx20, no Ultimate Baou Zakeruga, but it was just the two of them fighting off the Big Bad.I do wish there was a better epilogue though,
8
0I think it also helps that UtT's stories are pretty varied...and that it isn't anchored in goddamn High School.

Thanks anon, both for answering and for sharing your opinion. I have a pretty similar view on it, but I am particularly fond of Ushio Tora, in general but specially because of its ending. The final few volumes were filled with shonen tropes, but the fight felt important to me, it was handle in a way that I wasn't sure how it could turn out or who would make it out, something that most shonen don't manage with me. Plus Ushio is one of the best shone MCs in my book. Anyway, great going with the story time, keep the good work.
1
45Yeah the ending is real good. My favorite part of the fight is definitely Hakumen's last tail. I dunnow, it just felt so poignant. And in the end, you can't help bet feel sorry for it.
9Well, anon. Here's hoping the anime reaches it.

46Honestly, I'm not sure how I'd feel about watching this adapted when I mostly like it's shading which is best seen in black and white.It's weird enough seeing Tora as this huge pile of orange.

Kind of nice to know that Makoto Raiku was an assistant and fan of Kazuhiro Fujita. You can clearly see the Zatchbell/Tora - Kiyomaro/Ushio comparisons.I just started volume 2, nice stuff.
6
23No way. That's neat as fuck as my original plan was to dump Zatch Bell and UtT back to back as both had 33 volumes.I've also just recently finished Zatchbell's anime which had a terrible anime original ending but worked so well in most aspects that I don't want a re adaptation.Honestly, I've always compared the two as my two favorite shonen series. Who'd have think?
2They both also had sorta the same feel to the ending.

2If only Karakuri Circus got translated....
02Maybe the anime will get people interested? Hopefully...

2I've always had a soft spot for "even a human and a demon/monster can bond and team up" stories. That's what made SMT so addictive to me,I think.

1He listened to Yuto's ghost projection and got off Yuya's back. Although that might've just been from being surprised at suddenly seeing a ghost
7What's the worst thing that could happen?
8And he didn't ask Yuya about what happened to him in first place.1Yuto considered Shun his best friend, but I don't think that was reciprocal.
8Yuto is probably a Barian and has died at least 6 times by now. Shun is used to it.
Track you want most from Sound Duel 3:Go.
4Shun's theme.
5After seeing OERD Shun probably thought maybe Yuya really was telling the truth that Yuto gave him Dark Rebellion. And then for some reason he assumed Yuya was working with Reiji around the time Yugo vs Yuto happened, gave Reiji Yuto's duel disk, and then lied about it. Even though Yuya made his opinion on Reiji pretty clear.

What is with the sudden influx of fantasy MMO-like mechanics anime? This show doesn't even need the video game elements, since it's clearly a generic medieval fantasy adventure, but it still has them for no apparent reason. It's just bizarre, like if all harem anime were obliged to feature every girl wearing a purple hat.

4Making it like structured like a MMO makes it easy for the creator to introduce things into the world without thinking too much about it. For example, if you tried to do something without an RPG element:Creator: "This character can recreate any weapon he's seen using water."Audience: "Where the hell did this come from? Why water? You can't just do this"Now with RPG elementsCreator: "This character has a high water affinity and can make water weapons because of his unique character skill."Audience: "Makes sense"

4The "modern audience" is incapable of relating to anything that doesn't resemble their shitty multiplayer grinding games, so the effort of coming up with a unique world and setting is easily avoided by just throwing in elements your average MMO-playing shitter can instantly recognize.
2775743017What if he does kill himself?What then!? HUUUUUUH!?
0Yeah but he's also cute
4Yourself you must kill.
1Then the gene pool has less trash in it
5That's slapstick.Even Naruto tries to explain where special powers come from, even if they do it horribly and just say "because Sharingan" to pretty much all the lategame abilities.With an MMO setting, you can just say an ability exists without going into details about clans, eyes, emotions and alien rabbits or whatever the hell was involved in the Sharingan history.
4Then anybody who like this shitty show should kill themselves.
Blacksmith-kun should be MC.
0I like this show, I'm a sucker for medieval fantasy animu. Honestly, in 2010s, this kind of anime is not much.
3True.
4Or if every girl in a harem had a heart-meter hovering over her head. Maybe a bomb icon too.RPGs and other games use numerical "stats" to approximate real life because they have to, or it's the most efficient way. Anime has a different set of constraints that the audience is used to and is forgiving of, but to have an anime adopt straight-up game mechanics mumbo-jumbo requires two levels of willing suspension of disbelief.
4awoo~
5RPG NOT MMO, you fucking retard
5No, they're very much MMO specific.RPGs hide the mechanics from the player, since they're about immersion. The world of an RPG would never make reference to levels, stats, respawning etc. because that's all meta shit.

5Implying RPG tutorials aren't in-game canonThis is what you're not understanding
6Who says there can't be MMOs with permanent death?MMOMassively Multiplayer OnlineThis ain't an mmo. Granted it's rare to see meta talk in normal rpg's as opposed to mmo's, but the furthest you could go with this is call it a hybrid influence.
6Why in the fuck would you assume that a series written by a japanese man animated by a japanese company would have western game/tabletop mechanics and not jrpg ones?It shouldn't have "mechanics" at all. It's a fucking story, not a game.
5As I said, you should kill yourself.
9stories can't be written in x wayFuck off tumblr
7Tutorials that make reference to the mechanics themselves are more of a JRPG thing. In western RPGs you usually have the characters reference what actually happens in the game world while what happens mechanically is explained via text and meta-overlay.e.g. in Vampire Bloodlines, you're not told by the characters to "press F" to feed so that your "blood pool" is filled up, but they simply tell you to go feed.
6People can write whatever they want, the question is whether it's good.Do you think the whole MMO shit actually improves the story? I don't think it does.

1Nah, go fuck yourself prententious ass. Why do you watch shit like anime when you dismiss ways a story can be written?Do you think the whole MMO shit actually improves the story?There is a market for it because a large enough group of people who find them entertaining. Again, go shove your hot opinions up your ass.
0A failure.1Honestly I think a lot of these shows are getting the design better than actual MM/ORPGs. Particularly with the massive 100+ floor dungeons. Best part of dungeon crawlers is best part for a reason.
7Why do you watch shit like anime when you dismiss ways a story can be written?Not all ways a story can be written are equally good.There is a market for it because a large enough group of people who find them entertaining.Lots of people like shit, this isn't anything new.
4What's with the influx of retards who automatically associate RPG mechanics with MMOs instead of RPGs?This setting is closer to Diablo and other ARPGs than an MMO.
6Good by what measure? I bet you're one of those faggots who get off on objectively analyzing anime on mal with your buddies, fellating yourselves. Tip your fedora elsewhere shitstain

5Not to mention he's literally the son of god.
7I disagree about this sentiment. RPGs aren't about the mechanics, RPGs are about hiding the mechanics, they're primarily a storytelling medium. An RPG inspired anime would just be a fantasy anime.MMOs, to some extent also games like Diablo though, are distinctive in the regard that the mechanics become more important than the plot. You're not working to achieve some in-game purpose, but you're working to achieve some meta-goal, e.g. making numbers go up, finding better loot with better stats, etc. - the enemies respawn and actual "progress" can't really be made. It's fully repetitive.The way this show is set up reminds people of MMOs simply because it resembles the repetitiveness. People go into dungeons to kill respawning monsters, in order to gain levels and loot.
4Overlord this coming season is another MMORPG anime, that apparently has a lot attention.Lets see if this will also crash like the rest.
The main problem with this anime is it's not daily instead of weekly... fucking hate waiting for new episodes.
6the closest game i can think of that might have mirrored danmachi was Grandia Xtreme. And i thought it was a terrible game to be honest.
This kid is literally giving me diabetes
0Adoptive grandson of a god, he's human, his parents are human.
1no its be-cute-to-win.
3People go into dungeons to kill respawning monsters, in order to gain levels and loot.And Bell has the story of getting stronger, gaining friends, working towards his goals. It's just more of a dungeon crawler than ADVENTURE like most rpgs.

we will never get sakuga the level of episode 8's fight ever again
So does this show ever introduce any other guilds or go into other strong characters? I'm getting sick of Aiz and her band of misfits
0shiroe for ants
3SHUTTHEFUCKUP!!Listen you pathetic little shit i don't know where you get off thinking your opinion about which video player i use gives you some kind of fucking authority over me but i'm here to tell you that it does. so please by all means go suck a dick and die already!
2Those pictures are literally cancer. Stop shitting up /a/. It's bad enough as it is.
5Because it makes sense to put it in there THAT'S HOW.Is this new season? Why are you watching this?
Literally the worst show this seasonJust end it
5You should fantasize about being the god of the universe of the anime you're in. Make something up that's even more ridiculous than whatever the MC's got. It's a great way to suspend your disbelief even further, and what's more, you won't come to /a/ to complain about every little fucking thing.

6Fuck the fact that they're giving Hestia less and less screentime these past few episodes.
2Wow, you're on an image board for Anime, calm down man
5The whole "getting stronger" thing, is already very much a meta concept since it takes grinding to the storytelling level. Within the narrative of most RPGs, grinding has no place - it's purely a mechanical thing which is only possible when monsters respawn. In normal storytelling you wouldn't expect people to perform repetitive actions in order to make numbers on their back go up, but they'd become naturally stronger through overcoming obstacles. Factually, this is also what's happening though, since Bell doesn't need to "grind" that much really due to his abilities; he's thrown into situations only he can overcome, he overcomes them and grows in ability.It's just more of a dungeon crawlerYeah, most MMOs are dungeon crawlers at their heart though. The games are mostly about forming parties, entering dungeons or monster infested areas and murder everything inside to gain levels and loot.
4This is not a MMO. It's inspired from MMO but it's not one, is it that difficult to understand? MMO is a game, that's not a game.
2Suck my cock dude
2She's going to heaven and leaving Bell-kun alone soon. That's probably where they're ending the series I'd guess.
2Alright, what is with anons responding to that picture with awoo?Is it supposed to represent the sound wolves make by howling to the moon?
3Grandia 1 was fun though.Not sure re: 2.
4I wasn't aware monhun was mmo
2Go watch a shitty SoL if you want more Hestia screentime instead of dungeon crawling.
2See: 2
9Of course it's not an MMO, but the point remains that the way things are set up resembles an MMO - or a dungeon crawler akin to the earliest RPGs if you will, where the world is limited to a dungeon and a town.
4It's a maymay. Shitty fanbase always latch on to anything that can make their shitty show relevant.
4No.What are you, retarded?It's their mating call.
59Oh. Ok.Carry on anons.
3It feels more in line with Etrian Odyssey to me.There are mysterious dungeons/labyrinths everywherePeople in guilds are exploring them out of curiosity / to get stronger / to make a living / etc.Government infrastructure that facilitates for the presence of these guildsThematic connecting humans and godsThe list goes on.

4It was originally /jp/'s meme but then a Touhou secondary from /s4s/ started spamming it on other boards like /v/.
48I recall our usual response four years ago was either yiff in hell or burn it with fire.But I guess this is a bit more adorable.
0I'd say so. The mainline series, at least. EOIV is particularly polished. The different ways in which you can build and customize your party's tactics is the primary appeal in my opinion. It gives you quite a bit of freedom.Like playing without a dedicated healer; there are several ways in which one can manage without ever having a Medic as a party member with the proper planning, but your success largely depends on how well you thought through your advantages and disadvantages you have to contend with to taking such an approach.
8implying
0The different ways in which you can build and customize your party's tactics is the primary appeal in my opinionWell I think the exact same thing about SMT so this sounds neat.
mmowell it could be worse, he could have called it a moba
killing faster  killing stronger mobs is the general rule, except if the dungeon has some kind of balance penalty mechanism....

8Bell started 6 weeks agoSIXIt took Aiz a year to get level 2, that's 15 times faster.Also Aiz has Ariel which lets her use wind, but she's pretty much maxed out on skills, meanwhile Bell hasBerserk mode when in a pitchInstant castingliterally Stat boost hacksAnd he's only level 2, not to mention his dagger is leveling up as well and learns weapon moves

He went for the Yandere route. What the fuck is wrong with him? He had a good senpai and a cute tsundere and he had to pick the fucking crazy blonde maniac?
I'll start off with the unanimous choice:

0None.
1All I can think of is why is Brock narrating this shit? He gotta get back to his gym and level up his Onyx.

0It's the same melody but with english lyrics.What makes you think it's better than the Jap version? Do you speak Jap?
I'm a pretty big dubfag, and even I think dubbed openings are total shit 99% of the time. YuYu is barely an exception and I can't think of anything else.
9Naruto's first OP is far better than the jap version:
0the original dragon ball sound better in english even if the voice acting is meh its still vastly superiorOP feels alive as fuckjapanese one has weak vocals and the 80s sound effects are irrating
YO
0The thing about the Funi openings is that the vocals are hit or miss, the the backung track music in my opinion is superior. Ideally Id want the Japanese voclas over the English music.
0Obvious one.

one's posted my one of my favorites?For shame /a/.I fucking loved listening to this while playing this one Warcraft 3 Rurouni Kenshin custom game. Yahiko best boy.
Not posting this one.Too many underage here
7Sandy Fox could really do a great dub OP.
6Honestly, I cannot agree here. Mostly due to the English version sorely lacking in any brass instruments that make the original feel more exciting.The English version goes for a "pop" kind of feel which doesn't suit the composition.
9But the jap backing track is betterJap is funky as hell and danceableEnglish is basic, watered down version for crackas
0huehue opening is betterquality is shit though, like most br dubs.
0Fierce protector of the good stuff
7jap version is better though
8Something deeply bothers me about hueland's version of Unbalanced Kiss, though.
4Unbalanced KissIt's missing all the instruments from the original version, I think. I mean it has a beat, and that's basically it?
9No you don't.
7Every time I hear this, I get transported back in time to my old house after coming home from school and turning on toonami. I'll always love it.
7Fox Kids butchered that show in ways that should be fucking illegal, but damn if that wasn't funky as hell.
bad the rest of it wasn't very good.
Zeta Gundam's DVD release dropped the shitty J pop because they couldn't get the license for it. And replaced with the most awesome intro music ever.

8No, you're just wrong. I thought Space Dandy was a shitty snow so this has nothing to do with bias, the JP intro was simply better in every regard.

6Is it bad that I like both?Because I like both. Very energetic, gets you pumped.
8You're retarded. The jp version was golden and pushing it off for a fucking thirty second instrumental is in the worst fucking shit taste.However, that's not to say the instrumental wasn't nice.
I can think of one.

opening for one piece seems far more fitting than the Japanese or English opening song.

Original:felt like an X-men opening.
6God, yes. It's good to know I'm not alone on this.
44Sensation is still the best.
This was /a/'s official AOTS last season, right?
5Literally not even second favorite.
Yes.
Yuri Kuma Arashi was the best of the Winter crop.
9It doesn't matter, /a/ voted Death Parade the best in a poll.In fact, there was a poll asking "was death parade AOTS" and it won it 60% to 40%. A complete demolition.
Only thing I even watched, and it wasn't nearly as good as I had hoped
5officialno
It had best scene. I don't about best overall.
AOTSNah. It was alright though.
Yes, but only by technicality of being the least bad show last season.
fuck you. free! aws aots.
8Strawpoll can be rigged. You know that right?
All the shows were shit, except binan
4What if the poll wasn't strawpoll?Also, whenever Strawpoll is botted, there is a much bigger percentage for the rigged option Think over 90% by virtue of having thousands of bots vote a single optionIf DP,'s percentaje was only 60%, there was no rigging
5Nona was best girl of the season, at least.
5Why is Decim so perfect?
nigga last season was shirobako

8some shitty poll probably only posted in the death parade threadDUDE /a/ LOVES IT MANmost people didnt even watch it or dropped it early
0And I'm sure you would get the same result if you replaced Death Parade with any other popular show.
5Dropped
5Death Parade was only maybe top five, and in the most lackluster season of the last year, too.
Why do people think Death Parade is good?
0Redditors have invaded this board.
Nope.
5But that's wrong OP and you know it.
0Explain why it was bad
7Explain why it's good you faggot. That was the original question.
don't remind me, last season was beyond shit haven't seen a season as shitty since 2012
1It was fun with the best op of the season.
REV UP THOSE TEARS CAUSE THIS WAS ANIME OF THE YEAR
7I think press X to come back to life scene was better.
6ye disI don't even give a fuck
If it's a show that ran last season, Shirobako. Triumph of quantity over quality, in that it overwhelms with the sheer number of beautiful little moments that steadily accumulated over 2 cours, ending with two fantastic episodes that made one forget its slow start.If it's a show that started & ended last season, not a strong season. Best of a weak bunch was Yuri Kuma Arashi, if only for being a showcase of how far Ikuhara was willing to push it.
9P.S. Death Parade started strong, but Chiyuki's suicide felt disconnected from her current personality and the politics behind the organization was criminally under-explored.
I can't believe people liked Death Parade. How?
3No.
3nice art styleoriginal storyinteresting charactersgreat endingGee Anon, I don't know.
396P.P.S. Yes, Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso was my close second behind Shirobako. It was shameless melodrama but I DON'T CARE. 19th century romanticism set to 19th century romantic music. Wonderfully, beautifully done.
3It was pretty intense and dramatic at times. It had a good atmosphere to it as well and the animation was nice to look at.
5I don't know why everything has to be AOTS for it to be good, but that show was pretty fucking great regardless.
3I don't know what to tell ya."Learn to appreciate something different. Asshole." Works alright.
5superficial qualitiesAs expected from the retarded.I take it you can't think of a single good reason for why it's good?
8I take it you can't think of a single reason why it's bad?
3It is a mystery.Episodes 2-11 were boring as shit with no real development.
2Arbitrary shifts in tone that cut the emotional connection.One-dimensional characters for the most part.Every episode was insignificant and unimportant. Nothing was really at stake.Otaku pandering in a show where it was completely inappropriate to do so.Also, not necessarily a flaw, but to the idiots saying having an "interesting, original concept" makes it good, know that anything can be interesting and/or original. Who gives a shit if it's interesting? Anything can be interesting. If you can't follow that up with anything meaningful, it's a complete waste of time.
8Nothing is objectively good you fucking autist!There are no absolute qualities in anime, I bet there are even people who hate Spirited Away.
Here's a question for Death Parade fans. The claim that Arbiters have no human emotions when Ginti clear as day seem to have too much. How do you explain it?
8Please go back to MAL or reddit, where people genuinely believe there's no way to objectively measure or compare the quality of anime, and everyone circlejerks.Video very much related:
2So you only watch shows, because they are considered "masterpieces" that present 2deep4you themes? Nice logic there buddy, but by your standard series like K-on, nichibros, Cromartie etc. are complete shit. Therefore you're an idiot.
5I explain why the show's shit, then you proceed to assume I only watch certain shows.I haven't seen retards this stupid on /a/ in a long time. Reddit raid must be in full force; when does your ban expire, tim?
5shit parade is hipster garbage, so nope
2Otaku pandering in a show where it was completely inappropriate to do so.Inappropriate? He commit suicide how is that in anyway not appropriate considering that it fits perfectly to the stereotype suicide victims.Every episode was insignificant and unimportant. Nothing was really at stake.No shit Sherlock, that was established beforehand.One-dimensional characters for the most part.Arbiters don't have emotions.Arbitrary shifts in tone that cut the emotional connection.The shifts come with the different participants. If they had may every single game have the same emotional outcome then that would quickly become stale.Who gives a shit if it's interesting?Go back to reddit with your HURR DURR THIS STORY WAS TOO DEEP FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Association of Japanese Animations AJA announced on Tuesday that it has renamed Anime Mirai, the annual anime initiative that supports the training of young animators, as "Anime Tamago." As before, it is still part of the Japanese government's Agency of Cultural Affairs' "Young Animator Training Project." The project has opened a new website. The studios that will produce an anime short as part of the project include:Signal MD IG Port's new anime studio subsidiaryTitle: "Colorful Ninja Iromaki" tentativeDirector: Kentarō KobayashiProducer: Yoshiki SakuraiStudio 4°CTitle: "UTOPA" tentativeDirector: Takahiro TanakaProducer: Tomoko Ogiwara HarmonyTezuka ProductionsTitle: "Fusuma no E-shi" tentativeDirector: Fumihiro YoshimuraProducer: Yoshihiro ShimizuProduction producer: Hiroshi OosawaBuemonTitle: "Kaze no Matasaburō" tentativeDirector: Yuki YamadaProducer: Kiyohiko TakayamaEach studio will produce their respective anime shorts until March 2016. The shorts will premiere at an unspecified time in 2016.
TL Note - Tamago means Egg
It's time to settle this question, /a/.
New ThemesOP - CHiCO with HoneyWorks Ao Haru RideED - Aqua Timezfor Gender bend arc
02 fucking days.
0CHiCO with HoneyWorksYES, can't wait.
Aqua TimezTheir Naruto ED was good and Bleach ED was even better.Expecting a better one though.
0Will they air it together along the gender bender episode ?
0They usually use them for around 13 episodes
0Genderbender arc can not get here soon enough
0Did you even try to read the tweet? The OPED will change starting July.
I have a dreamThe dream of seeing this thread still alive wednesdayPost reaction faces
Aqua TimezThey're still alive?
It's only 9 episodes in and they're changing the OP/ED alreadyNo more DAY BY DAY BY DAY BY DAY
7I'll miss day by day
7Day by day really grew on me, I'll miss it.
7see 5
7Ending theme always changed after 13 episodes. It's kind of surprising that the opening is changing so quickly though - although they did something similar with rerunTama.
0Aw, damn.I'm going to miss Day x Day.
Is the Day x Day single out?
5Yeah, just check Nyaa.
0So 25 episode confirmed ?Fuck, I mean 52 ?Gintama never re-air for 25 episode right ?
Oh, I didn't know it was running past spring
6Well there's no reason to do less than 4 coursUnless Bamco are retardedOh wait they are
I know the next episode is tomorrow, but i just want to keep this thread alive
0Do you have a time machine to take me to the next episode?this arc looks fun
Is anyone here a buyfag?
5Waiting is a a bitch anon, but it will be worth itAlso Ginko's hair is better in the manga
3this makes my penis feel weird
0I'd buy an Elizabeth t-shirt
3I'd want one too
4They only used the Kintama OP during his arc from what I remember. This should be expected. I'm actually pretty happy they decided to go with a new OP for OP gag nonsense.Also the biggest problem with the current OP and ED is that it features characters that did not show up Genderbended like Zenzou and Katsura.
6Thanks
thread kill this fasts-see you anons tomorrow
NOOOO NOT THE EDMate, I love Negato to much. Destiny and Sharp are so fucking killer.
I'm going to watch all Shogun episodes today.Shige Shige
7See you soon
anyone have the full version of this
4Hello?Pls don't die yet
7Well then they're just going to genderbend them
Any idea what track from the various OSTs were playing around the 19minute mark of the latest episode? I'm sure it's been in another episode prior too.

As I'm sure everyone has noticed they have fucking computers in the soul society It is strange but not too weird until you examine the fact that they have been using them long before even the most basic computers were developed in the world of the living. They were shown in the 100 years in the past arc and most likely were around even further back in time.This would mean that computers were invented in the fucking spirit world; something that was never explained in the manga/anime. It makes me wonder how the information to build that tech reached the world of the living. Was it by accident or intentional; and if intentional did who ever did it break the rules to do so?. It makes me wonder if the soul society was responsible for other influencing other technological advancements. What if rather than the soul society influencing technological advancement it is something for deeper and more complicate What if bleach is set in the far distant future and the soul society is actually Japan. What if for some reason like the universe breaking down they had to create a new 'world of the living' to stabilize things starting at a specific moment in the distant past giving people false memories of what ever happened before. That would also mean that souls and the afterlife are an artificial man made thing created by science.
I wanna marry that fish.
Somebody have that looping webm of Leo rolling?

8Try kicking him in the face. It worked for Zapp.
3I watched a Kugyuu spring 2015 roles compilation on nico, and the entire second half was kekkai. 6 roles total, 3 of them in this show. MatsuRie will keep Rie fed.I'm sure Rie's thrilled about that and that she hasn't had to do a tsundere either. Hell, she's even allowed to show range.
0I love how her overly deadpan and professional manner disguises what a mess she is outside of work.
0It's not easy being so cute. She needs the occasional drink to help her bear the weight of her best girl title.
I hate that stupid fucking mushroom cunt. What a waste of an episode.
5It might've just been I rumor but yeah, I hear she's sick of the TsundeRie thing. Good VA's deserve the best.
3I consider the Heartcatch Precure movie decent enough as a stand alone since it essentially revolves around two original characters for the movie. It's definitely better to go into it knowing who the characters are, but the characters do basically individually give a self introduction to the new character.I liked that season of precure, so if you can do the episodic magical girl thing, it's worth giving a try. Plus there's Cure Moonlight Lady Koto.
6Gap moe at its finest, like everyone else in the cast. She fits in well with the fluffy-haired squinty manlet with awesome godlike powers, the guy who looks like an orc mated with a wolfman yet overflows with compassion for all living souls and loves fightan and pretty flowers, the trashy immature man-slut with peerless fighting skills and dedication, the smooth capable ikemen who's a workaholic with harem-MC levels of denseness, the eyepastched Amazon sniper who acts like the jolly team mom, the sweet elderly gentleman butler who's an immortal one-man assault team, the ripped man-fish with the personality of a Shaolin monk, the worst criminal in history and a living saint coexisting in perfect harmony, the scourge of Blood Breeds the world over who acts like a clueless oyaji, and the freaking man-mountain arms dealer who hates violence and prefers hanging out with his loli bff.
06It's a melody line used throughout The Magic Flute.need to sit down and read through the plot summary for it and see if there are any themes that parallel the ones introduced in the White and Black story now that we have enough puzzle pieces.3I think even when he does smile it looks so terrifying that most people don't realize he is.
8I really liked this post. You're a good guy, anon.
4I believe she's sick of it too, but she's a good enough sport to make jokes about it on Gintama.No idea if she's been turning down roles or tsundere roles have started going to younger seiyuu, or she's got enough on her plate she can start being selective. I hope it's the latter.
6They don't have that concept in America.Is she one age-wise, though? I wonder if she's older or younger than Zapp.
0She's too shawty to keep her shit in order.
This omake makes me want to see what a Kekkai rpg would be like. I bet Leo's HP and attack would be abysmal, and Klaus would one shot everything.
8shawtyI'm really not sure how that applies to her. She looks kinda plain most of the time.

6Most single career women are like this to some degree. For someone who throws herself into her job the way Chain does, household chores are one of the first things to fall by the wayside in favorite of her work both for Libra and for the Werewolf Bureau and her hobbies alcohol, Starphase, and drunkenly fantasizing about Starphase.
06She really needs a boyfriend to spoil her. Or at least hire a housekeeper.
I just realized in episode 10 that the sound of the scanner or what ever you want to call it when Steven gets a call from the Police guy that the sound is from EVE online probe scan
8Steven potentially plays EVEI don't know what to think about this.
2It. Is. Not.
1Why thanks. I'm glad to hear someone enjoys reading my Libra love tldr posts, because I really can't contain my affection for this entire cast. I've tried ranking them in order of favoritism like we did with the purity ranking, but it was impossible. Everyone is too lovable.Reminds me of how the BD ticket event was announced and they're calling it the Libra Japan Branch Welcome Party. When's the US division's fan event, Toho/Nightow/Funi/whoever's in charge of this shit?

1housekeeperDon't we know someone who has the right qualifications for that?
5In this entire thing I can see maybe 2 pics that could kinda sorta count but they're pretty mild. I don't know how I never noticed that he's never directly shown smiling, considering it's a running joke that it terrifies everyone when he does.

I found this:" Maybe because in most series this stuff IS filler? I don't really understand how you guys are surprised that people think it is. Personally I think this show is trash, using the guise of being episodic to be random but that's just me. The reason I say guise as well is because it really isn't episodic. There was a continuing story for the last two or so eps."Stupid pepople.

7dick sucks dick faceI almost don't want to ask what those lumps are supposed to be.
4With an attention span as short as this you'd think more typical anons would love episodic shows. I don't know why they all seem so down on them for whatever reason. Not like it matters, because "random" is pretty much the emptiest and most worthless non-criticism you can offer of a piece of media.9Dat oyaji realness. And more gap moe.4I will never cease to be impressed with the breadth and detail of the westaboo-ness of this manga. Every cheap novelty fake severed hand or rubber dog shit I've ever seen has had that exact same packaging with the diagonal writing across the cardboard tag in some garish font.

4I agree with this anon. The overture has been used a few times.
Can someone explain why they couldn't just eat? Is it a Japanese culture thing?
4Thanks anon, that was really cute. I wonder if it'll be put in volume 11 since it was apparently published during volume 10's serialization but wasn't in the tankobon. Is it normal for bonus stories to not make it into book format?
3God, he sounded so proud of himself when he correctly figured out that they were talking about a video game, too. My sides still haven't recovered.The anime really brings the comedy every time in lots of different ways, but this kind of low-key Scarface humor is some of the best humor.
So what are the casters and why did they needed to be trapped/killed or whatever happened to them?
7Any meal would seem less appetizing if you had to eat it while listening to a three-way marital spat with all kinds of accusations and explicit descriptions of adultery while you ate it.Good job to the anime staff for clearing this scene up, too. Didn't realize in the manga that this was blood.
7It's just uncomfortable, I assume.
7Screaming and TMI during mealtime.Even Zed was perturbed. That was the first thing that bothered him all day.
Twitter posted a teaser closeup of the beach illustration. Vacation realness Klaus a cute. Also, dem Puppy puppies.
2Puppy puppiesI'm pretty sure that's just some beyondian chick, not Chain. Just look at her skin colour.
29What makes you think it is based off of something existing rather than an just an improvised tune?
2Are we getting a beach episode?
3Because I'm certain I've heard it before. It's a familiar tune. And I can filter my memories enough to know whether I heard it recently, from anime, while on the computer etc. or just a really long time ago, this tune being the latter.
0Really? I thought it was her and they just drawing her skin tone lighter because she's the only Asian character.We won't know until big scans come out, but I don't know why they'd put random nameless girls in the shot and not include any of the existing female characters.
6new yorkMaybe they could swim in the filth of the Hudson River.
6No way would we be that lucky.0The Jersey shore isn't that far away. Besides, Scarface has got to know plenty of people with beach houses in the Hamptons he could borrow.
0I'd say Coney Island or Long Island but those are outside the mist as far as I know.
4I want to touch Zed's trident
6This is probably one of the few series where I would definitely kill for a beach episode. I wouldn't even mind if it were a OVA or special.
6People reinforcing the shiny golden barrier that keeps the city holding together and the Beyond from spilling out any further and making the whole world go ass over tits the way ex-NYC did.
9How would that go? I can see Zapp lurking in the background waiting for anyone sunbathing unaware to fall asleep so he could bury them in the sand and sculpt something embarrassing on top of them like huge tits.
4Or Zapp prowling on a sunbathing Chain and about to doing something shitty because he thinks she's asleep. She phases away at the last second and springs some trap.
8Sonic is imitating Leohnnnnnnngh85Yeah, where's Starphase at? If they're trying to get those girl wotabux they should know he's the winning choice.
4If they both got in the water there would be some pantsings for sure.
5I lived in New York for a few years and never once went to Coney Island, always thought it was just rollercoasters or something. The only time I saw water was when walking on the bridges and it looked pretty gross and unswimmable. The beyond aspect would make a beach episode pretty interesting though, recreational swimming must have a pretty low survival rate in HL.
4Speaking of bridges, I found out today that that mural that Zapp and Leo walk past all the time is real, and in the DUMBO.If we can figure out where this is on a map, it will bring us one step closer to pinpointing Libra HQ.
9sometime I wonder if they're doing this shit on purpose.
I'm late posting this, but here's the official summary for the LN:レオとザップは、任務の途上、とある女性の葬儀に訪れる。そこに現れた一人の少女。少女は言う。「それで、どっちが私のパパ？」。それが、この世界の“未来”を賭けた戦いの幕開けだった——。A mission brings Leo and Zapp to the funeral of a certain woman, where they meet a lone young girl who asks them "So which one of you is my papa?" And thus the curtain rises on a battle with the "future" of the world riding on the outcome——Just in case it wasn't already confirmed enough that this story really is going to be Paper Moon in Hellsalem's Lot, guest starring Daughter of Dick Suck.
archerwot
He was summoned as Archer in Fate/Zero. Saber somehow forgot he's fucking Gilgamesh
5She never knew.
5Secondary pls.
5She never knew he was Gilgamesh. Iskandar figured it out after a little while, Shirou and Rin figured it out after seeing Gil in action just once, but Saber still can't figure it out after a decade and several encounters.
5She is correct and also right.
2To be fair, for her, the decade didn't exist, the previous war was like yesterday for her.
5Jumping right into an S2
5being a loud, obnoxious secondaryplease leave and never return
2Shouldn't Shirou basically be able to figure out who anyone is just by analyzing their weapon?
9Ha ha!
9wtf? I was told i didnt need to watch anything before this
2You mean the entire time it took Saber and Shirou to go get Rin, Shirou never mentioned about Gilgamesh?
9That's kind of what happened, he realized that all of Gil's weapons were originals.
5You need to watch the prequel.
9Some weapons don't really have just one owner For example gay bulge. You could argue that the owners were of opposite sex but you never know in Nasuverse or never really had any hero associated with them KnB.There's a shitload of exceptions, you probably wouldn't guess who is Caster even if she showed rulebreaker in you face and told you it's name. Both Assassins were using fairly ordinary weapons as well Though you could probably somehow deduce Kojirou even if his weapon isn't technically his NP.
3You didn't need to watch anything before this to understand. All what she said told you is that he was the archer of the previous war and that she was in the previous war by extension. The rest of the scene especially spells this out. Archer is a title not a name dumbass.
1Not once. Shirou is not good with words, or knowing to talk and when to keep shut.
1That would imply that Shirou is actually a sharp young lad instead of a dense motherfucker.
4It feels kinda weird that Shirou would even know anything about Gilgamesh.And how do you tell originals from derivations?
9Play the Fate route. Shirou was able to rather quickly correctly guess Gil's identity.
Is an horse a heroic spirit?
5Goldman doesnt use a bow and arrowStill called ArcherMight as well call him Shooter
0How heroic is the horse in question?
0It could be, sure.
0He's a faker and also a sword, he knows his stuff.
0
0If fighter an JET can be one, so I don't see why not.
3the fighter jet was only a noble phantasm
24so if I summoned Secretariat as Rider, would he be, objectively the greatest rider ever? how exactly would you quantify his NP?
2Doesn't matter, anybody can get into the Throne for any reason.
The only reason she doesn't know is so that his identity could be hidden for a little bit in the Fate route
That's not Archer
5Nasu is a hack.B-but his world building is good!It's mediocre at best. He just does a lot of it. And there is of course the old argument that quantity is a quality all its own, but that doesn't excuse the lack of other positive qualities to his writing. Writing a lot of shit does not make the writing less shit, it just means there's a lot of shit.
9But those weapons have other names and Shirou can only read those names. The weapons Gil throws are currently nameless because they aren't attached to a hero yet.
this entire thread
3You're watching an adaptation of the second route of a VN.This was all spelled out in the Fate route.
1The weapons Gil throws are currently nameless Read the fucking VN, they are not nameless.In fact, the names of some of them were explicity mentioned like, Gram, Harpe, Houtengeki and Vajra.
1Hi.
3Hello?
6Gil's weapons are nameless. They're only the prototypes of the actual weapons and as such don't have a name. Even Ea doesn't actually have a name, he just refers to it as such."I have the original models of all the Noble Phantasms. But they are all nameless, and I am not their only possessor."A cylindrical sword.The sword is made of three parts, and each part is turning slowly in different directions.It looks like a rock drill to pierce through a hard surface."But this is different. This sword is truly a sword that only the king of heroes possesses.It has no name, so I just call it Ea."
6They were nameless in Gilgamesh's age, now Shiro can name them because he know what they will become.
archer rarely use bows and arrowsWhy is this allowed?
6A cry in the night. A hero steps forward.

6it have no name even though I already gave it a nameis Gil retarded?
5If someone has no interest reading the VN, it's more than clear that the viewing order of the anime is F/Z first and UBW after. Ufo's UBW spoils everything about F/Z.
6They should be called ranger.
2Shirou and Rin figured it out after seeing Gil in actionShinji literally introduces them to his new servant, Gilgamesh.
9I think they're talking about the Fate route, where Shinji is already dead and Gil just shows up out of fucking nowhere.
'Saber's Archer' is Gil, not Red Man
4Ok.
7I wonder how his face looks under that damn cloth.
2It's probably covered in squiggly lines, which carry prophetic significance.
Zero Zerker mopped the floor with Gil and managed to piss him off multiple times.He's the best Zerker.
Why does Rin care about avenging Archer? He acted like an asshole almost the entire time from when he was summoned up until his death. They didn't even seem very close. Is it just a matter of principle, and the fact that it was him doesn't really matter?
Could a servant like, say, Saber kill Gilgamesh? Assuming you had the element of surprise, would he really be able to withstand an excaliblast / lancelot nuke /gay bulge?
0mopped the floorBut he never so much as touched Gilgamesh.
3Because he's Shirou.
0this is what Lancelotfags actually believeWere it not for Tokiomi, Lancelot would have died on the first night
3It wouldn't have a name, even if he gave it one
9Secondary pls
0Out of all the other guys who've filled the class, Lancelot has literally the worst reason for his being a Berserker.
6Why do you think so?
0Animeonlyfag who never read the LN.In their first "fight", Lancelot barely survives Gil's GoB spam. Then Gil prepares a second, and it says Lancelot is fucked and he'll certainly be killed by the second volley.Lancelot can't survive the GoB spam. He barely survived one volley before Gil expanded the gate even more.
9I'm not sure if you're baiting or fucking retarded.Ever heard of the Fate route?
5what happes in fate route?
0Bucephalas is already known to be one.Almost certainly, Red Hare would be a hero too.
0No, this looks like somebody's stand, called Horse With No Name.
9Killing Gilgamesh is a difficult endeavor, but taking advantage of his buffoonery to achieve victory is a method available to many heroes. Even Diarmuid can manage it, somehow.
5secondaryCommeme
2commie has the best substhey put memes in shit shows to subtly tell people they're shit
7What would Archer's stats be?
7He'd have a reality marble, "The Danger Zone".
Could Archer win vs a serious Gilgamesh?
4if we're to assume a ''serious'' Gilgamesh would always pull out full-power Ea first thing, then no
4If you mean not-shirou then no, he could not. He'd be killed before reciting his cute little poem and reality marbeling. Even if he did get the marble, gil would still be better. And a serious gilgamesh would just enkidu and/or ea his ass in the first place. Gil's theme is that he always loses for being a cocky bastard.
2Why would someone from a celtic backwater know about Gilgamesh?
0I wonder if Sleipnir could be summoned?
1Servants get summoned with knoweldge from the modern world
4Serious Gilgamesh would be almost impossible to beat. It would take something from Merlin tier to beat him, or similarly godlike power.  Angra Manyu for example. 
4CouldMost likely. But it depends more on the situation than what they can actually do.3Ea has prep up time.9Perhaps even as much as, or more than, the RM chant.There is nothing that says that Archer's RM couldn't keep up with Gil's GoB just as Shirou's has.Enkidu is an anti-divinity weapon that one can evade or even break out of if they lack divinity.Gil only loses in three instances:1. Avalon being hax.2. UBW being faster than his GoB.3. Fighting something which is super effective against heroic spirit although by being caught off guard.Gil is perhaps the strongest servant, but just like a lot of shit in the nasuverse, there is a counter.There's also a reason why Gil wanted to kill Archer and wasn't near Shinji or Kirei.
8GOB can cover him during prep time
8Gil lost because shirou got close and by the time gil realized shirou was faster he had no arm. Gil has a wall of fucking cannons behind him, archer isn't going to win unless he gets up close and gil for some reason doesn't enkidu him the only logical reason being plot armour. The only time he didn't die cause of PLOT is HF.
4could they beat madara uchiha?
1I have this hunch you don't kno shit about this franchise
8Perhaps even as much as, or more than, the RM chant.Even if it were so, what of it? Even if Archer deploys Unlimited Blade Works, that's not going to stop a full power Enuma Elish. The reality will shatter apart and the crushing spacetime wave will destroy Archer immediately after.I'm a huge Archer fan and I can tell you that if Gilgamesh is 100% "kill this fool, no holding back" mode, Archer will only last as long as it takes to wind up Ea to full spin.A semi-serious Gilgamesh who will not use Enuma Elish would be defeated, I certainly think.
7wud watch
5I dunno. The name Rider implies that they ride something, and a horse can't really ride anything easily.
3Which version?
archerwon
4Berserker doesnt use a ber and a serkerstill called berserker
0version 8.0.0.81.35
3Rin has had an Archer complex for a long time. See her going on and on in previous episodes about how she wants him to be happy, she wants to save him, she has to "repay" him. Even after he betrayed her, it was obvious it never entered her mind for a second that she didn't want him back.Yes, it's a pretty nonsensical, especially since the anime cut the parts where Rin talks to Shirou about how much fun she has with Archer and likes being around him, but she cares about him a lot.
, 
Yuuko or Yukko?
u.co
8
5correct one or incorrect oneGee, I wonder.
6Google-chan and Nichijou wiki says Yuuko is correct, but I see the Yukko spelling in other places as well, including fansubs.
3Yeah well, those are bad places filled with bad people, stay away from them.
3Fansubs are never wrong or even less than high quality!
3isn't one her real name and the other her nickname?
7This. Yuuko is her real name. Yukko is her nickname. They're pronounced differently, it's not two spellings of the same thing.
, 
Give me five good reasons Anime is a superior medium to Manga

Is this the greatest anime of the year?Also, Lulu a best
0wat
0It's Ikuhara's weakest work by a longshot and a solid 7/10, so no.
02nd best after Hibike
9Ikuhara's weakest work was Sailor Moon S still counts as 9/10.
0what episode does this start to get good
Is it like Sabagebu?
0So far yes, but that doesn't mean much yet. Pretty week 2015 so far.
0It depends.Perhaps, but only if you exclude several others.
2if you exclude several othersWhich ones? I want to know what others see as competitors.
0Kancolle was pretty good
0No, it's shit
8You must watch in ep 1-3 in one seating.Shit starts to get real @ ep 4
0Well considering the only thing this season has been Etotama, then yes at least for now. We will see how Fall is.
4first and second are both yuri showsIs anime saved yet?
4Yuri shall conquer the earth
I just watched the first episode. Was this made by Shinbo? Why don't they just kill all bears? Is glasses girl dead?
3All these things and more you can learn by actually watching the show, and/or fucking google.
3Was this made by Shinbo? That's obviously IkuharaWhy don't they just kill all bears?Because they are equally strong?
0nope it was boring as shitthis show was 10x better
Can anyone explain what happened exactly in gaybears?I was a little confused.
DEEP METAPHOR
0More like hipster garbage.
Just finished ep 2. That plot twist at the end was nice. 7I guess Shitbo copied his style then because they're similar
8HAHAHA NOHad an awesome first episode. Had like 3 solid scenes throughout the rest of the series and finished like a retard on a go kart.
Who would win in a fight to the death?Demonbane is omnipotent, but Saitama can defeat anything in one punch.
2The whole point of Saitamas character is that he can´t lose, so...
2Saitama.A plot sword is superior to a plot armor.
7Burt that Demonbane would still lose.
Is Saitama the Mask of anime?
Depends on the narrative of the story they're in.When you pit character with auto-win abilities against eachother it comes 100% down to the author and his goals/narrative. Trying to actually fanwank about who would beat who is idiotic.
There is a Demonbane that has all of Saitama's powers times infinity.Sorry guys, I know you all like OPM, but he's nowhere near Demonbane's level and never will be.
1No he wouldn't.
So it's official. Demonbane wins.
5He would.
7No he couldn't, and it's reinforced by your inability to elaborate.Demonbane can summon infinity One Punch Mans to fight.
2But those Onepunchman would be stopped by the the Demonbane that would stop the summoning. Also, even if Demonbane manage to summon many infinite onepunchman, they would still lose because that's what Onepunchman is.
3You have twenty seconds to find a better and more funny manga or comic than The mask Vs Lobo.
4You're not making any sense.Demonbane wins.
2pointless because demonbanefags are fucking cancer
Power-Man wins.
What is Demonbane?
2Lol, why so buttblasted over your favorite character losing to Demonbane?3No he doesn't.1
4And it would still lose in One-Punch
7Yes he does it's even in the image
2Power-Man.
7Lol,kill yourself
8Nope. Doesn't work like that.If Demonbane can seal Azathoth, there will be no problems beating a planet-level character.0There exists a Demonbane that beats anyone in any image.
4Anyone but Power-Man.
Saitama would punch Demonbane so hard that the shockwave would spread across all of the infinite universes like a coffee stain on a comic page. Every Demonbane in every frame universe would feel it and die instantly. Soon the stain will overtake the infinite number of gook slave artists scribbling new frames around the perimeter. Before every new universe there will exist that one punch and thus Demonbane will never exist ever again.

RaildexRailIs this a newfag thing?
Biri Biri best girl and winner.
4Haha! Great bait! I'm sure you'll get all the newfags!!
4It's a bait just like NT3 was.Mikotofags will bit the bait but I'm calling it red herring again.
4Fuck yeah. Soon.
9*bite
4
I'm not sure if shippers are genuinely excited or it's just trolls baiting, but it's clear as fuck Kamachi won't deliver any kind of romantic development, and if he does things wouldn't look good for Mikoto.
4The "Darkness" chasing kamijou holds the overwhelming destructive force to overcome even dimensions.Kuro koK e  K
1Kamachi will never put real romantic development in his story. 30 volumes later and it's just something everyone should see. Shipping, on the other hand, is free reign. It's fine to enjoy the cuteness and other development that doesn't have to be romantic despite knowing no girl will win.
0Except for Index and Othinus who will be virtually winners by the end of the series as residents of the Kamijou house.
3overcome even dimensions
NT3 synopsis Gremlin. A global enemy force that is a fusion of magic and science. It seems this mysterious organization that appeared suddenly after World War 3 is working in secret in Hawaii, America's 50th state.Under the guidance of Leivinia, the boss of the British Golden-style magic cabal called the Dawn-Colored Sunlight, Kamijou and the others head to Hawaii. The group is made up of Kamijou Touma, Misaka Mikoto, Accelerator, Hamazura Shiage, Misaka Worst, and Kuroyoru Umidori. And just as they arrive at New Honolulu International Airport, an attack by Gremlin's magicians begins.Gremlin's plot is advancing below the surface.The sole man in America who has realized this searches for a means of resisting them on his own. He is the kind of person that just has too much energy.His name is Roberto Katze. Known by all, he is the President of the United States.Very different from NT13 synopsis. Its a hell of a lot more focused on Misaka. Expecting a confession since she is aware of her feeling for Touma.
0Index is daughter/imouto zone and Othinus is platonic friend who understands the most. Since it can't be romantic of any kind, the best Kamachi can do is have them like mascots living in his house. I suppose in a different perspective that isn't related to an 'end", they win in a way.
Shipping aside I'm very interested in how mikoto will react to touma having a panic attack due to magic god
3Confession will be at Christmas in the snowy bridge.
3It's more like OT12 where the fags were happy for the "date".
3I don't know how NT3 was bait to begin with. It had Mikoto being cute and the US president being a fucking badass.
3Haters on suicide watchI-It's just like NT3 g-guys I swear!!!!Hilarious.The chase battle involving Kamijou and Mikoto begins!Mikoto's turn as heroine.Kamijou Touma rushing through AC on the Acro Bike.On the back, Misaka Mikoto holds on to his waist for dear life so she doesn't get thrown off.Great Darkness pursues the duo.the duoB T F OTFO
So which character do we shit on this thread?
4Sounds fake. Mikoto is not even holding Touma's waist in that illusration.Also, Touma hardly looks like he is pedaling for dear life.In fact, this Great Darkness OP posted SOUNDS JUST LIKE SNAIL'S ARC IN MONOGATARI WHERE ARARAGI AND SNAIL ARE BEING CHASED BY A BIG BLACK DARKNESS AS WELL.OP CONFIRMED FOR USING A MONOGATARI STORYLINE AS FAKE SPOILERS.
5GOOD LUCK CHIHIRO 2
6That's jumping for convenient assumptions just like those shippers who think that being a "nun" or forcing the "she is his sister!"Birdway was created for that are something.
5feeling victorious for a simple preveiewAre you really this desperate?
8She will be completely clueless like always.
9Will this go the same way as pic related?
9Mikoto is more like Hinagiku 2. Both generic tsunderes that got BTFO by superior girls a
6BTFOThat never happened, tsunhater.
9Are you kidding anon? People claimed ship going real because of that cover alone saying Katze/Mikoto's dadsome yhough it was Tabigake was going to make them be together.
4Will she get a character development this time?
5Haters on suicide watchThe tables have turned.
4I think it's funny how all these caps are from the archive, as if no one cared enough when the actually threads were happening.Everyone dropped the manga during the shitty time travel arc anyway.
Mikotofags actually think the Kamikoto ship isn't going to sink in this novelMy fucking sides.Kuroko was the MC in volume 8, and she practically lost the Mikoto bowl there. Maria was the MC in NT4, and her love interest was even killed off.Misaki was the MC in NT11, and she also lost all chances of winning the bowl.The curse will continue on.
4She should hold on tightTouma looks like his shitting his balls on both someone chasing him and mikoto leisurely sitting.
6It's probably because every thread was filled with people screaming CHIHIRO A SHIT CHIHIRO A SHIT CHIHIRO A SHIT CHIHIRO A SHIT CHIHIRO A SHIT CHIHIRO A SHIT, also it's easier to do it in the archives.
2Are you serious? The reason Mikoto gave at the end of NT2 and the summary says nothing about them getting together romantically. NT3 was primarily for Touma faction helping Touma and it did just that. Moreover, Mikoto got to fight by his side to ease his burden like she wanted, so she accomplished that in the volume. NT3 didn't bait or failed here.
5Mikotofags getting their hopes up only to have them shattered when the actual novel is translated is going to return things to normality.
1Don't make me post A-tan.
8Liking A-tanBelieving A-tan will win
Hello faggots, I stopped to read the novels at the NT10 it's still worth reading?
8The cover was a blatant bait not matter what you try to say.
6Liking Othinusbelieving Othinus will win
7Othinusfags are literally the most deluded of all time. She's just another harem addition at this point.
7Othinus lost her chance when she turned into a smurf.
5Haters on suicide watchPretty sure everyone but delusional Mikotoshitters is confident Kamachi is going to fuck with shipperfags again. He has done that so many times in the past and yet you still fall for it yet again. You're blowing hot air.
7Othinusfags really are pathetic.
7Othinus is good and doesn't have to win. She isn't a romantic interest.
4Do we have a release date yet?
8I think it's July
8July 10th
9At least Maria got a well written and beautiful resolution.
95Thank you two for the info. Something to look forward to on my birthday.
5release on my birthdayCouldn't think of a better gift. Thank you, Kamachi-sama.8Is July 10th your birthday too? Holy shit.
6you will get it from amazon at July 11th
6Actually not quite. It is July 14th, but by then I would hope we should have some scans and somebody starts translating the novel.
Season 3 when?
7somebody starts translating the novel.Yeah, but I wonder who would be doing such thing.Who would translate the novel for us?
7It was obvious thoughNon romantic lifelong partners are the shit, reminds me of Mx0.
5And what's up with that guy who used to translated the novels? "js06" or something, not like if I need him to read the novels
5js06guyAngels have no gender. Go ask Aiwass.
7Meh, but Aiwass looks like a female, but anyway what happens to him?
9I have no idea of what you are talking about, but looking like a female doesn't mean much in Raildex. Kanou Shinka is proof.
3Are you seriously going to grasp at cover implying win? The cover is fanservice for ship material but also appropriate to show Mikoto finally joining the fight. That's it.
4Not that anon but I think he meant that shippers would take anything as proof to their ship.Also that cover didn't reflect the mood of the volume at all.
So anyone bought the rainbow spectrum notes?
Did js06 or anyone for that matter ever translate the Index PSP game? I want to play it since it has an original story written by Kamachi.
3Anon, well fucking done. I'd suck your dick if u are cute.
Season 3?
4Nope, get hype for NT13.
6I'm hyped for anything that doesn't have to do with Mikoto, so just the magic gods and the character lending Touma a hand.
6I'd really enjoy a season 3 though.
2lending Touma and Mikoto a handFTFY. Sorry, you can't escape anon. Get hyped for the Mikoto volume.
4We'll find out in a day if there's a chance of s3 being announced.
4Every fucking time.
3Mikoto should stick to Railgun only. I hope Kamachi at least will give closure to the pointless and half-assed unrequited love subplot.
7I've been told that too many times.
7I personally hope there's no Index event at the festival so I don't have to stress myself out and get my hopes up for the next 4 months
3Man that guy in that back reminds me of Jet from Cowbop suddenly.
4Man i feel bad for Touma. No Othinus to keep his sanity in check, poor fucker. PTSD going full blown out of check. Look at that face of fear and anxiety mixed into one.
3Get hypedNeeding hype to shit on a LN until the next onePleb you don't need to delude yourself into liking something.
3to overcome even dimensionsAww, shit. Well done, anon.
3Kuroko finally wins the Toumab Owl
6Don't feel bad, he has Mikoto helping him fight the great darkness. He's got a cool bike too.
2Mikoto helping him fight the great darknessSure if you mean the darkness of AC. If it's magic gods, she will be generally useless. Though the bike looks decent, maybe the next new thing from his stylish hoodie.
just watched fateyfw I realized that Misaka and Touma's relationship if she ever confessed would be like Rin and Shirou's: Misaka ludicrously beating around the bush at a dense Touma to do anything romantic ad nauseam
5Shirou ain't a faggot like Touma atleast.
5Yeah, Shirou's a humongous faggot instead.
6Fuck othinus bitch is the one who gave it to him. They both should just kill themselves.
8Please, Shirou is way more manly than that little bitch.
Never really been a fan of misaka but kind of looking forward to this volume still.
9both kill themselvesNah they are too warped for that.

7The universe, which co-incidentally contains Lili with that backpack with the universe in.
2A CUTE
7Lili and Bell's real body.
82Why do people like Aiz Wallenstein? She's literally the definition of plain. Liking Aiz is like liking vanilla ice cream.
6I just recently realized that Aiz is basically a blonde Koboli.
6The only good thing about that copypasta is that it gives me more images of Aiz.
Why does she look so much better in the manga?
1Stop sexualizing the Lili
1THAT HAIR
8Sex hair
1The buckle-less belt is hilarious. Skirt falling down every 10 seconds.
1WHY IS HER BELT ALWAYS OPEN
4Easy access
8TO WHAT?
Anyone else bothered as fuck that as they were running away killing the monsters no one was picking up the loot?
0beer and buritos

Her pussy must be tight like a baby's.
3tight like a puppy
4Do you see her skirt falling down? It's obviously only there to give us boners.
2Mhmm delicious. But why would she keep the food in her pants? There's the backpack.
4Fuck off.
1That tummy.
1I want to lick her belly buttonIs that wrong?
5You might get lint on your tongue. Aside from that, lick away.
1jesus looks outright sexer then Hestia
What subs are best for this?
6Horriblesubs because they are not 5 weeks behind.
4How can they get her proportions so wrong in the anime? She looks like a midget or something.
6Just like how the anime got Hestia's wrong, if she IS a real oppai loli.
4LILI is best girlLILI  elf maido  hestia  evil semen demon  sexy black smithgif unrelated
So how is the light novel for this? I heard that the anime skipped a lot and sometimes changed things.
4Go back to your leaky doghouse you ugly little fox-mutant.
8The LNs are very good. Personally, I find them better than the anime for the reasons you said, as well as another thing: in the LNs, we get to see the exact numbers for Bell's stats, so we can tell exactly how much he's grown. It's a small detail, but it greatly affected my enjoyment.
6better than the rest
6that waistFuck all damn I cummed allover my ceiling
8They're fine but don't think that they're being translated.The only person translating them is a retard that can't even write properly so a lot of people are hoping someone else will step up to the challenge,It's really depressing to think that the only person translating them is a retard.
6Isn't she supposed to be a midget because she's a not-hobbit/halfling?
6Jewish Princess Onee-sanAlso,Not liking vanilla ice cream
2you can read moon, i assume?
Since Tate no yusha updates at a glacial speed, I have to ask. Is this worth reading?
2I've read some god awful translations before like the first chapters of Le Festin de Vampire.Is the translator not fluent in english or not fluent in japanese?
6I think you're talking about another wn
6wn?
3I have no bloody idea, but not too long ago he got a proofreader. It's been months and he's only done the prologue and the first chapter, it hasn't updated since the end of march. It's safe to say that the translation is dead, which is good, hopefully someone competent will pick it up in the far future.
6I'm using DDY, but CR/HS is probably good enough. There's no typesetting to worry about and the dialogue is basic enough that CR can't fuck it up too badly.
I want to fuck up LiliIn a sexual sense
6But I like vanilla ice cream and dislike Aiz.

Where were you when pomf died?class="quote"Pomf.se will be shutting down after ~2 years of operation sometime during this month, the entire sites and all of the files will be archived.
Literally who?
I don't care. Fuck off
at least we have uguu
what the fuck
sitting in my chairmom call downpomf is killno
Good. Thanks Wub.
4I do. Fuck off
84being this newI bet they save tumblr gifs too
5After 2 years of operation IM SUCH A FUCKING OLDFAG LOL
So, sound webms on /a/ natively fucking when.
8Fuck, they were a nice no-nonsense filehost. One of the last around, AFAIK.
HAHAHAHAHA
8Ironic shitposting is still shitposting.
4There's a setting for webm audio in 4chan's settings, so I assumed it was already supported, but off by default. Is that not the case?
4Only on /wsg/ sound webms are allowed.
5They've been around since what, 2013? You're not some elite oldfag for knowing them. read 8
8Hontoni gomenasai
9You are wrong, there is a few other board that have sound enable.inb4 whichLurk moar
49Why?Is not a copyright issue, because of /wsg/And I doubt it is because of bandwith, either.
Where the fuck am I supposed to upload non-4chan webms to then?This has to be the third file upload site that accepts webm shutting down this year.
5elite oldfagThat's not what I'm implying at all, holy shit, is it that hard to be informed?
0being a filthy crossboarderAll I need to know/care about anyway is /a/. /wsg/ was just a fun fact.
8Because 4chan isn't a video-watching site, and people would abuse the fuck out of screamers.
Oh fuck.
85He's saying that they are newfags, not that he is an oldfag, and the fact that pomf exist since not too long ago makes it worse for them, retards.Also those fucking captcha are getting impossible
4posts tumblr gifMy sides.
3The other chan has them for months and there are no issues with screamers at all, unless you count gachimuchi as screamers, and people already use pomf or link to /wsg/ when they want to post sound webms.Get real, and stop drinking the kool-aid, /a/ drinks the kool-aid too much.
8It was meant as a .gif replacement. Sound was enabled on a few boards after 2xchan supported webms with sound.
webm is the next HD DVD
8
8well, shit ;-;
5I only recognize his name from the thank-you on rbt. Who is he and why the hateboner for Pomf?Also, that's too bad. Glad to hear all the data will be archived, at least, and there are alternatives.
Buying my own domain to upload my shit. See ya later poorfags.
Daiz shut it down because he's making the shift for Webm's in 444 Hi-10p.
Why didn't they just have a donation link in the corner or something?
3unix timestamp for filenametumblr gif"no"1Yeah I think most people have servers of their own, but having an external service that's not registration-based and botnet was nice.
4Founder of partyvan.eu  Had various ethical conflicts with pomf, see also in the transparency section7If you upload a tumblr gif to 4chan and redownload it it's still a tumblr gif
8partyvan.euwubthecaptain.euskipping over his sites and I didn't find this guy doing anything worth while? It's because he didn't publish it in his site or he is simply just an autist?
While this is a shame pomf was not used widely enough here for this to be devastating.
1AFAIK he fakes to be autist to get autismbux.He just offers various services on party van, nothing much.Also FUCK THESE CAPTCHAS.
9If they enabled sound webm we wouldn't need pomf at all other than larger filesize webms
8how would a doujin die?you are talking about that pomf right?
Why should I care?
1Just open the link in OP, my newfriendthat's ‘dojinshi’
Everything will be daijoubu.
Who is pomf? Is that the tripfag who used to post her? Why is this relevant
8Why am I shutting it down? Well there is no way for me to keep up with the b/w costs, I could get a 1gbit/s connection for about ~600EUR extra money I don’t have or pay thousands of dollars in CDN bills which I don’t have. Nothing will be daijoubu ever again
God fucking damn it. So much shit hosted on there.
37
8Waah, then what will we do on the bed?
tfw mediacrush died and I only found out like a week agowow dude, now pomf is dying as well?we're fugged
Well I hope the take down notices don't disappear. I still haven't read through most of those.
0the file hosting is only 1 day temporary thouwhat to use, now that pomf is dying
4Cubeupload has been around for years and nobody gives a shit about it. I mean that in a good way.
4I shall remember this.
449Did you even read the blog post?
9Eh, it doesn't allow webms, so I don't see much a point. Still, I have shit on there that I uploaded in 2010 and it's still on there.
23
3Yeah, but its kinda hard to have faith in these temp startups. It took a long time to start trusting shit uploaded on pomf to stay on pomf. I'm not about to start throwing shit on pomf clones when nobody expects it to stick. If I wanted a temp file host, theres tones of them that will fit the job. I'm looking for a reliable host that can do webms and won't go down in 6 months.
2They're not temp tho
none of the replacements have the branding power of a name like pomfOh yeah maxfile just rolls off the tongue. Doesn't sound like a generic ad rape filehost at all.
7What is wrong with loveisover? Anyway I wouldn't be surprised if WTC hosted a new clone.
8Goodnight sweet prince
3and people would abuse the fuck out of screamersThere is nothing stopping that now. This argument is a retarded fear of change; it basically encapsulated everything /a/ has been for the past half decade.
8Just think: Rapeape could put up a donation banner on a few popular boards and it would easily get enough funding. 4chan owes sites like pomf and fools/archive.moe for being a powerful tool which has keep people staying on and giving them more and more ad and jewpass revenue. 4chan should support the satellite groups which keep people here instead of what they have been doing for years which is continually implement shit which makes them more money will pissing off the user base. If they enabled sound with webm files you can bet it would result in a significant increase in traffic. Does reddit have webms with sound? These days they seem to be trying to make 4chan more and more like that place; maybe if they do it then jewt will get off his arse and enable it.
9Good thing they don't then
I wish other sites didn't pick up pomf.Stupid retarddit has to ruin everything.
8loveisover sounds great. It is an answer to the eternal question whatislove.href="#p126486065" class="quotelink"5Inaction without support has both caused for example pomf to die whilst not making sure there is a means to fill the void. They are going to lose users due to this. Way to miss the point there mate.
5I wish other people didn't use a great file hosting service created for people to be able to use muh secret club with millions of visitors billions of people are aware of It must be painful being such a fucking hipster.
1Good.

2005 was a fucking decade ago
9Damn, well that's a fucked way of putting it.1 God p. ease don't remind me. I feel so fucking useless now. Back then we had like our own voices yah know. But you're right 10 years have passed I'll just stfu
Don't worry, anon. A few of us still remember.
Because most anons don't care for stuff in the mid 2000's.
I even got a minimalized wallpaper made. Probably the newest content about mahoro in half a decade!God damn that was depressing to type.
Do the bd's for this look good?
If there was anons wanting to watch mid 200's stuff what should they. If they were here.
6Check out Black Cat, that shit was fucking incredible for me. Before all the high high action overpowered shit. The Manga was my cup of tea. We used to have a shit ton of threads on /a/ about old-tier anime rather than what was new at that time but even so some mod always deleted what he didn't like. idk if it's like that now though since there's millions rather than a few thousand.
9I'm not a good judge of these sorts of things, but I really did enjoy rewatching the series with the bds. I thought the quality was really awesome, but it's been so long since I watched it originally air I don't really know.
6Galaxy Angel is fun
6Maybe make a synchtube channel or something and gather before they die out.
Good stuff
5Fun thing that i'm just watching Galaxy Angel right now

6/watching episodes legally
6If i go watch an hour of japanese advertisement back to back will that do? Companies seem to put huge value on showing me shit ill never buy
6Japs don't care what gaijin wants. If a million gaijin bought some anime's BDs then the studio who produced it would literally say "sweet extra dosh to fund shit that only nihons care about."
1This. I used to buy DVDS to support the industry. Now I can't wait for it to die so it can be reborn.

ITT: Tropes/Cliches that always piss you offCharacter is going in for a speak attack and YELLS right before they're about to attackFUCK WHY DO THEY DO THIS, ITS THE DUMBEST SHIT EVER!
3How about the one where the character is about to do an attack, then spends 5 minutes explaining what it does?I mean, I know the audience needs to know what powers Character A has, but it could be done better than "I am Rawhide Kobayashi, I will defeat you using my powers which allows me to harness the rage and strength of 40 bulls and the lactating abilities of 40 cows. Using my abilities I will charge and rip through your steel resolve folded over 1000 times by superior Japanese willpower."
7Why can't they just have the narrator say all this shit?
MC is japanese
8This bothers you why?
5Because adding a narrator changes the tone of the work. That's why you see some series include mostly useless characters who act as fight narrators, like Speedwagon.

3Character can see the future/have premonitionsSomething HORRIBLE is going to happenDoesn't speak out about itCharacter is surprised when shit goes wrong/that he/she couldn't change it
1That's because that tends to be the typical high school boy reaction in actual japan. Same as girls being dishonest and tsundere-ish about their feelings, that's actually quite typical of teenage girls and even some adults in japan.

EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
1I think this is fine when it's actually used right. Several dramas get a lot of mileage out of the character self-reflecting about whether or not they love the girl, feeling conflicted, meeting another girl who they also like, normal drama stuff.What's worse is when the MC tries every other damn chapter to confess to the love interest and get interrupted by one of the members of the harem, or by a freak accident, or some stupid thing. So the series goes through every single fucking harem romcom scenario, the pool, the beach, cooking, a summer camp, hot springs, doing the exact same shit that every other harem romcom does, maintaining it just by having some bullshit happen so that they can reset the status quo and make more money by selling the next copy.Can't we just have nice, planned-out, concise stories anymore? Everything's an endless scenario machine these days.

Mine is the "pure, peace loving princess" trope. It's especially popular in mecha anime, and a sad attempt at appealing to women by making the character who pursues peace over war some princess chick or a woman from a politically powerful family. She always winds up having her ideals shattered, getting killed in order to advance the plot, or relegated to a cheerleader who doesn't fight but prays for the MC's victory. Protip: making the only major female character a saint who is peace and purity and goodness incarnate doesn't actually appeal to women. Little girls, maybe, but not women.
It's time I use THAT...

7except when Trigun does this in episode 5 it's actually kinda cool and exciting.Man, Trigun was really good wasn't it? Average, but good. Good avrage. AveraGood.
Characters who's only purpose in the plot is to get kidnapped. This does not apply to all characters that get kidnapped, because if a character is properly developed and written then they will be entertaining and likeable despite that.
3Ragna isn't goofy. And unlike Vash, he actually has killed people ,and has destroyed military facilities.
9What does it matter if it appeals to women or not?Your entire argument sounds like something out of Tumblr Go back there
4Ragna isn't goofy.Have you PLAYED any of the the story modes in Blazblue? He is a complete goober most of the time.
1I have, and he's isn't as goofy as Vash outside of the gag reels
14He ran out of a Chinese restaurant carrying a catgirl on his shoulders because he didn't have enough money to pay the lunch bill and now he is wanted for not paying that bill in that district of the city.Yeah that's pretty not goofy.

3Exactly, that sort of thing can be nice character progression. It's not really tsun in the modern sense.
4Patlabor did an interesting aversion of this. The protagonist is the daughter of a liquor store owner and as a result can hold her liquor like nobody else in the cast. There's an episode in which she becomes increasingly weirded out by the drunken behavior of the rest of the cast at a work gig, played almost like a horror thing.

5In a thing where at any moment, any person could die. Probably helps to have more than one, along with somebody to support her. I'm not saying it wasn't irritating mind you.It was a nice touch that in the PSP version you only got the 'highlight shit I can click' feature once Kyoko started rubbing off on the MC. It was the right call to give it to you from the start on Vita, but it was a neat touch regardless.
5To be fair, our main character is suspicious as fuck.

7Gendo references are great if done right. Pic related, the character has the same voice actor and the show often makes jokes about that and Eva.Also he didnt invent the lean forward dark face dark background two hands clasped on chin thing.
4I think you're confused. He meant sneak attack but had a typo.
5JojoI thought all the Jojos were at least in High school. Jotaro is 17 isn't he? Admittedly he looks about 23 in part 3, but oh well.

9Why is Gintama the best anime in all categories?It's like, others don't even get a chance.
1This. Especially when the entire plot hangs on it, and especially especially when the whole thing could easily be resolved by just sitting down and talking it out.
9 power of friendship/loveAgreed ten times over. I don't make anime planning on being /lit/ after military, tbh, but my villains don't deal with this bullshit, because it only works on clinical psychopaths with no friends.Only one villain is a psychopath and none of my mains are.and as it turns out it doesn't work on her eitherThere's no power in love, but theres some in trust. Its a running theme.
3How about when the character has some sort of extra sensory ability that should tip them off that their opponent is unharmed, but they still wind up surprised when the dust clears?
3Villain's power only lasts 5 secondsSpends 2 minutes monologuing while using it
5"badass" villain can only fight for 15 minutes

3secret society that shouldn't realistically stay secretThis especially annoys me in modern settings where every other person on the street has a camera phone on them. I don't care how good your cover-up goons are, there's not much you can do when two dozen people upload that superpower fight to Youtube.
first girl in the whole series to be introducedMC is head over heals for her and shitFuck that.
5I liked how in Tiger & Bunny one of the protags had a habit of making the social media and Twitter work for him instead.
96Power of Friendship is never depicted in the realistic but cool way where friends coordinate well with one another and are crazy in-synch in various situations allowing them to pull off crazy cons, badass stunts, or even just trusting one to be able to make a perfect sniper shot when the meleer of the duo is in trouble.Instead the power of friendship is always treated as just another super power.53funny thing is, if one combines this with Shishio, the idea of him monologuing in the middle of a fight would make sense as a great way to stall for time to let him cool back down and keep going longer than normal.10Japan's notorious for being littered with spontaneous portals which lead to and from the TRUCK dimension.
5Not anime but all this makes me think of is The Secret World.Though in that case, several secret societies in-universe have control over social media and will make things disapoof if they don't like it.Unless another Secret Society wants others to see it. Such as The Dragon constantly reinstating Tyler Freeborn's blog after The Illuminati take it down
9So long as we're stepping away from anime for a moment, I'll say that the series I was thinking of when I wrote that was Harry Potter. I've never seen any secret society as self-destructively oblivious as the wizards in that series.
0Power of Friendship is never depicted in the realistic but cool way where friends coordinate well with one another and are crazy in-synch in various situations allowing them to pull off crazy cons, badass stunts, or even just trusting one to be able to make a perfect sniper shot when the meleer of the duo is in trouble.That happened a lot in anime. Maybe you should stop watching shitty adaptation from shitty LN or Shounen Jump.
0To give some credit, half of the shit involved with wizards seems implied to be invisible to muggles, access to mind erasing spells, plus most of the books are set before social media and cellphone cameras became a big thing. As I recall, the series begins in 1997 and concludes in 2004, JUST as these things were getting big.Related to the "Not-So-Secret-Society" thing:Covert Operations Archtype Characters like ninjasDress obviously like ninjas and never do a damn thing to disguise themselvesI get Naruto's author fuck, forgot his name wanted to do his own take on ninjas and he's not the only one who is guilty either, but fuck it would be cool to imagine Naruto characters acting like real ninja and for "hidden villages" to actually be a network of of special shops, stores, etc. all involved in a conspiracy that supports said ninjas.
2Hey, it happens in LN too.Were it not for his comrades, MC in pic related would've been dead 10 times over.It isn't power of friendship/love as it is power of teamwork and trust.
4The irony in that post is that Kishimoto wanted it to be wizards and not ninjas but when he learned about Harry Potter he changed it in fear that it would be compared to/ or lose out to Harry Potter.Why the hell do you think they are more like wizards than actual ninjas?
4It wasn't supposed to be about ninjas, it was supposed to be fantasy about wizards, but some other fantasy shounen started couple months before it and editor suggested he switch the theme to not overlap with already going manga.

As I recall, the series begins in 1997 and concludes in 2004, JUST as these things were getting big.Yes, that's true, and remembering that fact is about all that allows me to still enjoy that series. However, the sheer incompetence they show when trying to blend in pretty much counterbalances the lack of social media. The movies on the other hand have absolutely no excuse. fuck it would be cool to imagine Naruto characters acting like real ninja and for "hidden villages" to actually be a network of of special shops, stores, etc. all involved in a conspiracy that supports said ninjas.If that was Naruto's premise I might have actually watched it.

15Huh... That... Really does make sense. It is kind of a shame we never got to see Wizard!Naruto, kind of wonder how it would have been.Would they have been Western style mages or Japanese/Eastern though?We'll never know.2Horses gallopingSounds like coconuts being banged together8it's a cliche, but it's meant to be juxtaposition of demeanor and words versus actions. Funny enough, I think real world sociopaths are known for doing this.4The movies on the other hand have absolutely no excuse.The movies have no excuse for a lot of things, like not using contacts and dye to make Daniel Radcliff a fucking green eyed, black haired kid. Shit, CGI was even still good then.If that was Naruto's premise I might have actually watched it.Dude, I know. Makes me want to one day make a game where you play as a true, stealthy, disguisy sort of ninja within a secret society. Sort of a cross of AC with GTA maybe? So it's sandboxy with lots of side missions and such but- bah, I'm rambling.
4Well that's your fault for watching adaptations of video games where you are supposed to self insert as MC.

7This is yet another thing that can actually and does occasionally happen. Though its also a sign you need to adjust your fittings.

first girl wins!No, seriously, stop it.
4what if first girl really is the best girl?
7Some of these like the club-closing and "it can't be helped" are common in rl Japan though, aren't they?Tsunderes, though. So sick of them. All I can think about is how unhealthy and immature their behaviour would be seen irl.
3That's bad as well.I mean, I get that in some cases, perhaps especially in older harems, it's pretty clear from the start who will win and it works, but honestly they should be a little less obvious. At least make TWO girls more or less equal contenders, like it was in Haganai at the start.meat was clearly best girl anyway
1Don't remember if this happened with the mc, but in YuYu Hakusho one of the good guys uses a "forbidden technique" and it fucks up his arm on the inside. it was paralysed or something. I remember him taking ages to be able to use it again.
8When I was a teen, I was way too obvious, but not in a tsundere way. I was overly affectionate and a bit of a creeper.I honestly can't imagine why someone would even try the tsundere route - especially the lengths that anime like to take it. You could scare off the guy forever with that abusive shit.
student council presidentspls
4most tsundere girl winsI liked Steins;Gate a lot, but I found the romance pretty predictable and dull. The confession WAS cute, though.Also  braids girl and Ruka were superior choices imo. Even with some of the later reveals, I still kinda shipped the latter with our mad scientist.The only example of an anime I've seen that DIDN'T end with the tsundere was Ano Natsu de Matteru. Really recommend it - for a teen drama it's surprisingly engaging and funny at times. Though the beach episode is terrible constant new girl chasing a guy that gets creepy.

0TTGL did it best though. They didnt take it too seriously. Absurd, over-the-top, just for fun, and entertaining. It eventually became "ha, they're throwin galaxies at each other, thats crazy"Not, "No I cant lose! AAHHHH! [power increases 10x]
8side-character/deuteragonist is too strong/charistmatic compared to MC and lot of people like himlater in series MC becomes chosen one/god/immortal being/super powerful side-character becomes useless and everything he does results as failuresBeing second protagonist is always suffering, you never win.
1I'm the one you're replying to.I generally hate muh resolve and consider it shit tier writing, but TTGL is the one exception for me, as it was actually good.I gave it a 10/10 precisely because it was the kind of thing I generally don't like yet it was great.
3blonde
1You do realize it's an indicator of japanese female purity to not like things like that, right?To the point that they sometimes fake "no, stop!" while having sex to not seem like sluts who like it, even if they're married.The only depressing thing about it though is that a lot of girls actually condition themselves to not like sex because it's not a girly thing, and you know how japanese women try to be girly.It's simply one of the contributing factors to japan's population issue.
4halfway the anime another girl gets introduced10 times betteryou know she wont make it but the writer still thinks he can push a love competition in there this can last for quite a while and make /a/ lose its shit when the inevitable happens
None, I love tropes.
0no they were better characters but worse love interests. If you play the VN youll notice how poor their routes are. Since they are branches that die out immediately. Romance in stories is something that isnt just wish fullfillment but also has a meaning. Luka just was "I like okabe but hes not gay". The ending of the story was nice how he refused to tell okabe he loved him when he was male again but that was all the development there was to him. Same with Suzuha, she doesnt have romantic development, even in her ending you dont have that. Meanwhile mayuri and kurizu make sense. Especially if you dont do the extra kurizu senses for her route.

6I also always hated this. Those noises however seem to be especially used in a subservant character talking to someone of a higher rank. I think it comes fro this.
experimental/prototype is always 100% better than final model
Particularly battle/action anime/manga:Scientific/medical expert performs some complicated procedure in the field because it's necessaryScene is completely unsanitary, has dust/smoke blowing around, etc.SuccessNo long-term consequences
8The only way it'd be possible is if there'd be some critical flaw/risk to using it, that's somehow only suited to one protag.Totally unacceptable if anyone especially without the ability to reverse-engineer it can then use/borrow/steal it
9I assume you mean part 8 Josuke. Also Jolyne is plausible
series introduces an insanely badass villainis only in like four episodes or is just a one-off despite being far better than the other villains
0It is after Egypt.
4Ya Jolyne is plausible like I said. Idk Josuke Higashikata. Wasn't as bad as Jotaro but still, it's Japan, he was a BIT built for his age.I'm at GioGio currently.Btw where can I get better scans for this part?I've checked various sites inc. Batoto but there's this sorta black hole with decent scans then it goes back to HQ.
Character that want a harem and not afraid of woman. Being almost useless in the fight unless Deux ex machina
ancient weaponry left to gather dust and rust in the most miserable conditions are still fully operational after centuries or milleniano need to do maintenance check or anythingancient weapons are always better than what they have today
9I never seen Jolyne being referred as JoJoh that's why. By better scans do you mean better translation? If so then probably never. Its somewhat of a meme in /jojo/ threads that part 5 suffers a lot from bad translations and the characters characterization suffers a lot.
9Not translations, I mean this:

3I generally hate muh resolve and consider it shit tier writing, but TTGL is the one exception for me, as it was actually good.Not that anon but you're basically saying you don't like something when done half assed or badly, but you like it when it's done right.Are you alright in the head anon? do you have all your faculties up there?because thats how things are supposed to go.Don't blame the cliché, instead blame others for being shit at making them.
8Well yeah, thats pretty much how it goes, though normally prototypes aren't supposed to leave the drawing board and not everything gets carried over to the final model.People go complete overboard with the design and specs, give proof of concept and then figure out how to mass produce a cheaper version that does the same but with less output, less bang for your buck and whatnot.
9Well, to be fair, when 99% of all instances of a cliche suck it becomes understandable why people start to hate the cliche itself. It doesn't really matter if some magical guru somewhere in the world can make a cup of piss taste great, most people will still say piss tastes bad because 99% of the time it probably does.
1That'd be more bang for your buck, and it wouldn't do the same thing or the prototype would be worse.
1I would argue her case for a good/acceptable Tsun.Absolute duo was overall a mediocre anime though, and they completely fucked her character over when she turned clingy to the MC a few episodes in.
96I used to hate the "power of friendship" too.Until I realized it's actually a metaphor for bureaucracy. Like in real life, no matter how shitty the guy is compare to another one, bureaucracy can always make him win.That's the power of friendship.Right?Right?Nevermind.

5Say what you will about Kill La Kill, at least the recap episode was done before the opening credits. I wish everyone else would do that.
8Go to bed anon
4It's a stupid, clandestine, poorly thought out attempt at pandering to women that I hate.
8This trope can be found in most Gundam series 00, Wing, and SEED immediately come to mind, as well as Code Geass and Macross.
92Well, I also liked it because the whole show was just about that, instead of the cliche being simply an easy solution for a bad writer to use in a tricky situation.That's what I hate the most.In TTGL it was all about that and it was done in a fun way.In most shows it just feels annoying.That's what I meant.Also6is not wrong.
8He's right though
8Some ideas seem dumb at the first moment but they have a way to crawl under your skin and stick there forever.
The worst are the people who keep creating these shitty greentext threads.

8I agree with pretty much everything on the list but, mate, you must really hate fun and decent writing if you hate MC always winning in the climax.Holy shit.Pick any show and tell me it would be better if the MC didn't win during the climax, baring those where the MC is the villain, I dare you.All that build up, all that hype and clashing ideals only for MC to lose at the end when it matters the most? I hope you aren't in the business of writing or directing.
7But Nia fucking sucked and I like girly shit usually. A legitimate Mary Sue.Yoko was based. I still wish she got her own series as her teacher persona, resorting to sniping to save the day once an episode.
1That'd make for an interesting plot twist and a decent life lesson for all retards who think just because you work hard you can achieve everything you want.
1I think it would work if it followed the anime cliche of not bothering to show the characters actually working hard. Then it would be revealed that the hero WASN'T powering up offscreen, and so gets demolished for half-assing it.Go! Princess Precure is interesting in that while it's message is following your dreams, they actually take the time to show the MC being taught things and working her butt off to get them right meanwhile the other two teammates are pretty much ahead of her in every way. It works quite well.
7Subverting hard work gets you everything by having them not work hard and failingHow does this work, exactly?

5Yeah, is that a Japanese thing? Over here we don't even have a student council or whatever.
9He helped you prolong your horrible, useless life? What a great guy.
3I seriously doubt it's an actual japanese thing. I can't imagine japanese teachers letting kids boss them around. Students in japan are run to death.
5Soul Eater and I almost want to say KLK.
3We have student councils down here. They don't really do too much though.
5This is only acceptable in hentaidat public bathroom doujin tho
1Prison SchoolDon't get me started.
Generic modern character designs, especially common for girls:Realistic body proportionsRound ass faceRidiculously oversized eyesStubby upward facing not-nose without nostrilsMouth is just a line or, when open, a small round orificeSAME FUCKING FACE EVERYWHEREAlso, archetypical girls made for otaku to fetishize. Everything that contributes to the "best girl"/waifu meme usually disgusts me.
5If you want to see this to the extreme check out Sukeban Dekka. The student council runs a whole crime family in the school, including weapons trade and blackmailing.
0I'm neutral on it. Why is it bad?
4I like to pretend that it takes place in a world where everyone is a clone, but everyone forgot they're clones.
5Does this exist?
Horrible CG character in the background just standingSee Parasyte and Baby Steps.
0implying it isn't good in Prison Schoolrefer to 2If the power wielded by the student council is used for sex, everythings daijoubu
0Uhm, anon, the topic of the thread is "tropes that piss YOU off"It's just my aesthetic preference, I happen to dislike this as a trope, I'm not saying it's inherently wrong.Well.In Prison school it's a bit too much. Especially the principal council interactions, it can be the teachers are paid well and don't give a shit about the students, but the principal taking shit from the council when, since it's not stated otherwise, outranks them and just takes it feels bizarre.in KLK where 1mentioned at least teachers don't care or are enemy agents under cover, so it makes sense. PS it makes no sense.
1Now I get it.
4Plastic Memories would have benefited the most from a different artstyle this season imo. Everything looked so samey that I couldn't get past ep3 even though everyone was hyping it so hard. MC literally looks like the most generic cookie-cutter character ever. If they had proper visual direction it would be the undisputed aots
8No. That's even worse. Students outranking students feels just wrong.Teachers using students would be hotter though. Either ~ara ara or pic related types. I just can't handle non-bratty girls as dommes, it feels like a perversion of the term. Little girls are not worthy of power.shotadom is a different issue though
7Why the fuck did I put the "non-" in the spoiler?Ignore the non-.
9I actually love the power of friendship. Completely and unironically, I absolutely love it.
mcs who accept being treated in ways they don't like by people they're supposed to be friends withnigga, if you're a masochist and like it, like the mangaka to assistant san guy, it's fine, if you're not and are distressed get her to stop.Tsundere in My space kitten can't be this slutty was really annoying.
1It kind of needs a break though.
1To be fair, a dude with a shit self-image is naturally going to be in doubt if a girl way above his level suddenly falls in love with him..
5Power of perversion can be a substitute.
2Seriously? I heard the story is a mess.
7girls as dommesimplying it isn't the girls that are dominatedalso implying the Vice President wasn't basedadmittedly she was playing on the ara-ara tones so I guess you're rightpic somewhat related, Mandarin translation of Prison School when I was in Singapore, thought it was Japanese at the time though, never found the original as I can't read moonrunes.
8You can see the sad coming from a mile away, but the art is so unoriginal it turned me off and I've just been relying on word of mouth since
7I love the Bomber in HxH because that's a very clever use of this cliche.
"I was only testing you"
1it isn't the girls that are dominatedWell, it isn't. it's the guys. Every ps girl portrays a domme archetype, regardless if it's true.vp is ara ara dominant seductionpiss is bratty girlmanhater is cold bitch dommekate is lezdom, it backfires in her facerisa is cuddley, uncertain, learning dommefujo can be seen as a nod to forced crossdressing/forced bi domminganzu is light teasing delinguent typeI'm not sure if chiyo or cake san will end up being one type. Chiyo probably.Also, regardless of what image they portray, vp is actually a sub.I love assertive, duty-focused amazonian subs. Usually fighting maids or military types.
5Really the only thing I dislike about DIO at the momentlel let's see how good our punches are jotaro I won't kill you right now and ensure world domination
5Why is CCS color palette so appealing? They don't draw em like this anymore.
3MC is hard work incarnate, trains a lot to be strong and bets geniusesYou're the chosen one/from a special bloodline/have reincarnation or past life or amnesia skills.The later it appears the more ruined a series is.
8I was talking about lewd student councils in general. Students abuse their female counterparts is delicious, but point taken on Prison School. I'm pretty behind on reading it so I don't really know all the archetypes but yeahFuck I love amazonian subs too. It's almost like having pride in taming a wild beast or some shit
5For me, it's not the taming itself, it's the fact that shy timid subs neither react interestingly enough, they just take it mumblingly, nor can serve you with the dedication and efficience someone like meiko wouldBack to the point, in what non-hentai manga/anime do we see lewd abuse of female students by not-exculusively-female student council? care to give me some examples for research?
2Katanas are really not nearly as bad as you think, anon. They're not particularly better or worse than any other sword and let's be honest, swords aren't particularly good weapons in the first place and were used because they fucking fulfilled their intended purpose being sidearms, status symbols and duel weapons.
5The same reason the earlier Pokemon episodes had a rustic charm to them: hand-painted cels.
3 Evil character was bullied as a kid and is now taking revenge
1non-hentainone that I know of atm. Lewd female abuse is pretty rare outside of hentai in general on a regular basis
8So like most western Russians? You know, from parts of Russia that people actually care about and are not surrounded by empty plains as far as the eye can see?
guy discovers some crazy shit, let's say alien girlfriend falls from skyhis mother, father, childhood friend, ara ara teacher, delinquent neighbour, cool senpai, garbage picker, dog, three pigeons that sit on the fence across his window and the shit he took this morning all knew about these stuff and are all in -occasionally different and possibly rival- organisations related to it
0Yeah that gets me too. It's not like getting your lunch money stolen will turn you insane like Kefka.
8lewd female abuse is pretty rareWhich brings out to another point of annoyance fitting this threadNo dominant mcs. Not in the powerful/strong sense. In the kinky sense. Seriously, are male dom wannabes forbidden? Every time bdsm stuff happens it must always be a domina type?I don't mean assertive, I get it, our otakus have to self insert, the guy has to be shy, cool. But can't his fantasies be of the dominant variety every now and then?
6I think you are talking about Hiei when he used Dragon of the Darkness flame or whatever. He lost the use of his arm for a bit.
7I really, really want to see what this ability looks like now.
3Not to project, but I think this really needs to be brought up, as it's really fucking old.Any female character who just happens to have small breasts MUST have them brought up at some point in the seriessmall-chested girl always envies busty girlsmall-chested girl is masculine and can't cookbusty girl cooks perfect bento, gets perfect grades, and is sometimes the oujo-sama student council president to bootThen again, the small-chested girl usually is the cookie-cutter tsundere who gets the MC in the end, but the "flaws" they keep picking for them are really, really predictable.
1Also doesn't help that he's completely clueless to everything happening in the plot
1This drives me up a fucking wall!
0I am, I just didn't want to mention names in case anyone in the thread wanted to watch it.I have a good memory for useless shit, trust me.
7Where else are you going to pan? Down at the ground? At the girl's crotch?
4To guy never even went to school and spent most of his life living in a church under the watch of an airheaded nun who was never particularly smart or competent and training in the wilderness.Him being clueless and stupid makes sense.
4panning at the girl's crotchKeep going.
4How about finding another way to show a character's distress instead of resorting to cliches.

2You got some weak/clammy hands, bro.
EHHHHHHHHH!?*pans up to the sky*
 Character gains amazing superpower with no real downsides through happenstance The only problem, really, is that they need to use this power with some modicum of responsibility "A bloo bloo bloo, I just want to be normal like you, milquetoast Japanese high school kid with chin length hair and bangs!"Or Villain is losing near the last episode. "Impossibru! How can you be this strong!?" "It's because [vaguely philosophical-sounding nonsense that kind of ties into the overarching theme of the show but doesn't actually make any fucking sense when you stop and think about it for a second], of course!"Every fucking time.

3Actually, it's not stupid. It's called a kiai, and by doing it one tightens one's core muscles and squeezes a little more power into a full-body motion. Very common in martial arts.

Protagonist slipsALWAYS either lands on the breast or accidentally pulls down the girl's pantiesB-BAKACut to afterwards with the MC having a slap markThis shit isn't funny
2There's a way to do that properly, though, and it generally involves yelling WITH the attack instead of before it.It does not involve shouting SUPER ULTRA MIRACLE FINISHING HEAVEN'S SPEAR NECROGUN before you strike.1Where did that cliche start?

If you ever see a character cough in anime, they are marked for death. I called what was going to happen at the end of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso at the first hospital visit.
7You misunderstood 1 's point.He said that in real life, you can't achieve everything with hard work. That's just a retarded trope you find in fiction.Also it's commonly believed by many people.But it's obviously wrong.Many use the successful as an example and say that X worked hard all their life for his dream "and look where he is now. He's rich and famous!"But that's fundamentally flawed. As Schopenhauer said, you should ask the many unsuccessful, not the few who made it.You'll find that for every one person who hit the jackpot, a hundred others tried with all their strength and failed.The ones that got to try in the first place are lucky.Think about it.Most of the people who have the hardest lives in this world are people who will never amount to anything at all.In the end it's all about luck.

Archer basically drops a small nuke on a graveyard in the beginning of UBW.When these huge fights occur in a moderately populated area, how is it that NO ONE comes to see what's going on? Can they really pass off a huge crater in the middle of a park as just another gas-leak/explosion?

3We have them, they're pretty much irrelevant. I remember in high-school there was always a commotion during election week, with each party doing their campaign blaring music in the school yard on breaks, with each respective candidate doing a ton of promises to the students. Once that ended and the elections were done, the winning party was never heard of again and the president never gave a fuck about anything.
6World is comprised of power blocksMain one is totally not NATO that seems to have replaced the UN as the main international governing bodyQuickly becomes apparent that it's super self-interested and just wants to push the agendas of the involved countries and companiesVery first episode they make a point of the fact that Japan is a member and totally complicit in the shady happeningsSome shows get it super right.
4To give some credit, half of the shit involved with wizards seems implied to be invisible to muggles, access to mind erasing spells, plus most of the books are set before social media and cellphone cameras became a big thing. As I recall, the series begins in 1997 and concludes in 2004, JUST as these things were getting big.The end of the series is in 1997. No cellphone cameras at all and social media meant you had a Geocities page.The epilogue with their kids takes place in 2017.

, 
What are your thoughts on the 'Three Episode Rule', /a/?Do you really think it's okay for a series to be kind of boring or full of exposition/world building as long as it gets it's shit together by the end of episode 3, or do you think anime should maybe unrealistically be held to the standards of something like eva where despite any flaws that came later had a fantastic first episode that perfectly sets up the rest of the series.
I drop things I don't like.
2People misunderstand the 'three episode rule.'It's not "Watch three episodes no matter what before dropping it" it's "By the three episode mark you should know enough about the show to form an opinion on it."If you can tell a show doesn't appeal to you within the first 5 minutes, go ahead and drop it. Forcing yourself to watch three episodes of something you obviously don't enjoy is just retarded.
I wish people would simply watch a show until they realize they don't or won't like it and drop it. There's way too many fucking threads being made asking if X series is good and if they should watch it.
You can't tell either way. There are slow burn series or acquired tastes which take more than three episodes to get going. Then you have shit like Sword Art Online which immediately jump the shark after three episodes.Rather than something arbitrary like # of episodes, instead watch the series one season or story arc at a time.
4Youll have an opinion about the premise and characters, not the show as a whole. There are quite a few shows i would have dropped if not for the 3 episode rule that went from boring to crazy good right on that 3rd episode
The 3 episode rule is more like a guideline, anyway.
2I break it if the first episode is exceptionally bad. Thats for fucking sure.
The only anime I dropped because of the rule was Stein's;Gate. It was so boring.
I don't drop shows at all. I've probably finished about 5 or 6 shows that I hated at first that I ended up enjoying immensely or actually promoting into my top 20. But to your point, I think if after three episodes you're not feeling it, it's completely respectable to drop it. My philosophy will always be pic related.
41678I figured the general idea was something like this.With that said, what about going into shows retroactively. Would you say a series that takes a really long time to get anywhere is good, even if the payoff is itself pretty awesome?
2What are your thoughts on the 'Three Episode Rule', /a/?More of a guideline. Don't be autistic.I gave Yamada 8eps. I gave Show By Rock 1.3. 1Come on, sometimes things take a turn for the better. I would never had watched wixoss if I hadn't gone into threads and been told it wasn't targeted at little girls
2I watch the ending of a show then go from there.
three episode rule only works if you're undecided about whether a series is worth continuing. before you hit ep 3 it goes like this:bad - dropdunno - continue until ep3then at ep3 you evaluate to decide if you're gonna continue.
Quite a few series get better long after three episodes, this is the case with pretty much all Gainax series. Though if you don't like the genre you probably won't like the series.
ITT: People waiting for Denpa Kyoushi to get better
4get better at what? no, i'm not watching it.
1How did pleiades develop, anyway? I got hung up on the costumes.
4There's like 2 people on this site who watch it. Both of them ironically.
I never thought of the 3 episode rule as a means of determining if a show is good or not.It's simply a way to see if you are INTERESTED in the show. I think you shouldn't watch a show you aren't interested in anyway but if it still doesn't get your attention in those 3 episodes then it's definitely not for you and you should just drop it because your final judgement is going to be greatly hindered by the fact that you're slogging through it rather then watching it with genuine excitement or curiosity.
2I typically watch at least 3 episodes of anything I start. The only thing that will stop me is if it's absolute garbage or if the animation is so bad my eyes bleed.There have been many times where I hated the first episode or 2 but kept at it and ended up really enjoying it. Just because the first episode sucks doesn't mean the rest of the anime will, just like a fantastic first episode doesn't mean the rest of the anime will go down the shitter.
3For me, I think One Piece is really the only /a/ example of something where I ended up liking it after I forced myself to keep watching.It's pretty fucking lame at the start. You're in for 6 volumes before it starts becoming something special. For the slow-as-fuck anime, that's 24+ episodes, or 2 modern anime seasons.Definitely worth it, though. Very few shounen got good and stayed good for as long as One Piece did.
I have no rule or 7 of some number of arbitrary episodes that I should watch. I watch what I want to watch and drop what I want to drop regardless of my progression. Each series differs wildly so an arbitrary percentage of all episodes watched is pretty trash.
24Pretty much this
2If someone isn't interested enough to keep watching, then telling them it "gets better at episode X" would be pointless anyway.
It makes no sense, 3 of a 12 episode series is very different to 3 of a 100+ episode series.That said my own personal rule is 6 episodes, because that's the limit of my attention span for one sitting.
8I found that if I dont know I just stick with it till I make w decision, and if it gets bad I give it 1-2 episodes to recover. If you find a episode that really puts you off do you give it another chance?
6On that note: if a show gets drastically better or worse, it usually gets mentioned when people talk about the series.
If an anime doesn't have an established world, plot and characters in three episodes, or those things all suck, I drop it.Anime budgets naturally pander to this rule, as episode quality starts to decrease later in the season.
9If you find a episode that really puts you off do you give it another chance?usually, no. i will double back on series if i catch an interesting picture or someone recommends it to me even when i tell them the problems i had with it.
6it worked for me quite a few time though
2Texhnolyze is one of the slowest anime ever, yet is probably one of the best ever if you can make it through.
4the day it was confirmed 2 cour, a small part of my soul died
I watch the first 3 episodes to decided whether or not to drop it. I do have another rule where I should only watch shows that catch my attention.
What about Utena? I can't get through the beginning it but i here the final episodes are the greatest anime has to offer. fucking bullshit if you ask me.
6This. I usually wait 5-6 episodes though, especially if the show is longer than one cour. Like mahouka. Dropped that trash at episode 6.
4I learned more about astrophysics from watching Pleiades than I did in every other level of education combined.
4Chou Dokyuu Shoujo 4946this shit doesit's like cancelling Double Arts while giving Nisekoi an animeOH WAIT
2it is a stupid meme7/9 of my "3x3" series i hated until good 20 episodes inyou can tell if a show is worth watching from the premise/staff, and it often takes a cour or more to get to where you truly like it
3I cannot support something like wan piss, but I agree with the general idea that "slow burn" series are emotionally better than cheap shit.
2post it fag
2One Piece is great from the beginning though faggot
6...that is an unexpected response. It's not bullshit? How is it as entertainment?
0You didn't think utena was worth watching the second the first duel happened?
9the manga that is, can't speak for the anime
2The three ep rule isn't for shows with shit first episodes - there's no need to continue watching those. It's useful for things where the first episode isn't shit but also doesn't seem like a clear indicator of the quality of the rest of the show. You drop Isuca episode one, you give the three ep rule to Texhnolyze.
0Utena goes literally deeper after the first thirteen or so episodes.
5my 3x3?not sure if its here i spilled wine all other my computer last weekhere it is from puush
5the party scene made me stop. I tell myself i am going to watch it someday though.
2I typically give a show 4 episodes, but I will drop a show if I'm not enjoying it by then.
0not watching it for you daily dose of ZETTAI UNMEIYou're not anime-literate if you haven't watched utena, even if you don't like it.
4I think a person should watch the show completely before commenting upon it.It saves the trouble of making threads pointing out "plotholes" that ends up being filled as the series progresses.
Horizon only got good after 5 episodes.
I have a hard time dropping anything that I'm remotely invested in. I sat through 150 episodes of Inuyasha, after all, before finally putting it to rest.I think I have a problem.
27/9 of my "3x3" series i hated until good 20 episodes inSo is your 3x3 stocked with LoGH and HxH, or do you actually hate your anime-watching experience for the first seven hours of every eight hour show you watch? If it's the latter, you should probably find another hobby.
7Definitely underdog of the year imo. The characters are engaging and fun to watch for one, and it's got a warm friendly feeling to it. Each episode finds a new way to surprise me, whether it be surprising plot developments, or interesting scientific concepts explained through anime. Have you ever wanted to see a mahou shoutout travel at lightspeed? Or visit the center of the universe? Or watch a star explode? Yeah it's pretty entertaining.
7yeah I understand
7 fafnerI like this anon, this is a good anon.
5different guy but I actually only got into it after The curry episode.but really the series only goes full Ikuhara during the recap episode when Akio shows up
8Horizon never got good.
2*shoujo, pardon the autocorrect
3If you're just getting hung up on some part of the show, power through.Well, all the yurifags tell me to watch simoun and it hasn't happened, so I guess I'm a hypocrite.
4You're an idiot.The reason the three-episode rule exists is because it often takes until the third episode to get an idea of what the show will actually be like, because the first two are for establishing characters and setting.You cannot, I repeat, cannot form anything even close to an accurate opinion just from the first episode, let alone the first 5 minutes. Even if it starts off as the most derivative moeshit you can imagine you don't know if the story might turn that upside down once the story starts.
I don't follow any rule, I just drop stuff when I feel that I'd be watching the next episode more because I want to finish the series than because I'm interested in actually watching it. I very rarely intentionally drop shit, I just delay watching the next episode for a month or two, until I completely give up on finishing it.7I've probably finished about 5 or 6 shows that I hated at first that I ended up enjoying immensely or actually promoting into my top 20.what shows?
5I'm in the middle of watching a show right now, I'll probably continue it after.
3I am beyond certain that nothing worth watching happened after the ten-minute mark where I dropped Denpa Kyoushi.
Some series like Shiki take forever to build up to a climax.Before getting into Shiki I saw footage on youtube of the end of the series where the humans were eliminating and genociding all the shiki. It seemed pretty cool to me, and I was mislead into thinking it was what I was getting.The entire fucking show was leading up to the LAST THREE EPISODES where I got what I wanted. The first three episodes were well paced, since it's expected of a show to take its time at first, but this dragged on all the way through toward the endand the worst part is: none of that time was spent meaningfully to develop characters or things like that. It went on and on and nothing happened. So here's the lesson: The three episode rule might work sometimes but not always. Some series get more interesting later on like Serial Experiment Lane and some like SNK completely lie to you and pretend that the first three episodes is the whole show but hit you with long waiting periods.There's no solid rule when it comes to pacing. You should however, know what you're getting and know whether you'd be interested most of the time
8yeah Shiki was a shit show though. If all they did was change the shitty designs it would be fantasticinb4not liking wacked up designs
2It's not a bad idea.
3You cannot, I repeat, cannot form anything even close to an accurate opinion just from the first episode, let alone the first 5 minutes.This is objectively wrong. I knew Saekano was going to be generic haremshit after the first episode and I was completely right. I didn't need to watch two more episodes to figure that out. I also knew Punchline was going to be a convoluted mess of a show after one episode.Anime is extremely predictable, 90% of shows follow the same formula with the same archetypes and cliches, once you watch more than 10 anime you can begin to easily recognize those patterns after only a few minutes.Yes occasionally you'll be wrong, but most of the time you're saving yourself a lot of time.
6what shows?Argevollen, SamFlam, Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom, Symphogear, and Love Live! all struck me as either outside my interests or boring but I'm really glad I decided to finish them after I started watching them.
9First few OP arcs were just generic battle shounen arcsArlong Park was a good battle shounen arcIt wasn't until Alabasta where the world building started manifesting
8I am a NEET, so if I did not anime I would have no hobby. Vidya got boring 5 years ago. However, my top cap right now is 50 episode series - HXH and LOGH were both downloaded by very far down on the backlog.
2I'm with this guy8do you mean to tell us that you spend 20 episodes watching a boring show just so it will be awesome for 5 more episodes?The experience is the journey. If you spend 7 hours getting into a show only to like the end then it isn't a good show. An entertaining series should have a pilot which gives you a good idea of what's to come, buildup, and a climactic and epic finale
8first two episode's EDbright and cheery with girl playing aroundthird episode ED goes full DARKNESS
1I agree. The hairstyles were fucking stupid.But you said without the shitty design it would be fantastic. I don't necessarily agree. I think it dragged on too long and didn't meaningfully explore characterswhat do you think?
8megucafags
2Do you really think it's okay for a series to be kind of boring or full of exposition/world building as long as it gets it's shit together by the end of episode 3I actually enjoy the "boring" stuff people often complain about, so yeah.I think as a writer having that "hook" is important to keeping people around, but not to actually telling a good story. 3 episode rule is only really good for judging the feel of a show, not how it's going to develop, so I just use it as a rough guideline. I've dropped shows after a single episode to be honest.In stark contrast though I've watched shows past the 3 episode rule because everything seems great, but they end up being shit and I watch them anyway just because I want to know what happens since anime are so short these days and it's not a chore or a massive waste of time to keep going with a 1 cour show. Fuck Sacred Seven. It truly showed me that the 3 episode rule is not always a good guideline to follow to the teeth.
5I disagree, the middle and the ending of the show are the main part of most series. A show with an engaging start is enjoyable but fades in comparison to stuff that gets better as it goes on.
6Different anon here. While I agree that not enough time was spent on the characters, I liked the slower pacing at the beginning because it added to the sense of dread that the series was going for. I like horror where the scary part is the inevitability of it all.
8I know it's not relevant and you didn't imply that in your postbut the first hunter exam arc was one of the better arcs of the show
1 if I did not anime I would have no hobbyI'd rather jerk off or even just sit with my thoughts than watch something shit for seven hours.
6I just enjoyed the plot and general concept/approach to vampires, a genre I have never found interest in. Also the side human brutality flip at the end was cool. And I agree the character motivations and development were pretty shallow at times, and i think the character designs may have assisted in that. I've heard comparisons to Salem's Lot too which i have yet to read.
6true, but consider that some shows are 30 episodes long. The original anon said that some shows get good 20 episodes in.Even for a show like naruto with 220 episodes, that's horrible. FMA has 60 episodes, and by then Lust is killed and the story progressed a great deal
5or even just sit with my thoughtsThis is the worst thing ever
9Good pointExcept there's one problem with that: The show took a 180 at the end and went with the "Shiki are all innocent" sad ending. So all that buildup was for nothing. If shiki were a legitimate threat who weren't pussies and actually fought back against the humans, and the last few episodes weren't so fucking sentimental and tried to explore muh morality then it would have worked somewhat
2For a short one-season show with just 12 chapters those 3 episodes form 25% of the show. After seeing that portion of the show you should be able to know what the series offers.But as people above have said, if the show is absolutely nothing you like you can drop it in just a few minutes. No reason to watch something you don't enjoy.
Sometimes plot-twist happen that turns the entire scenario around Sometimes the characters that seemed flat or unlikable before gets building that makes them a lot more appealing Sometimes something interesting gets introduced that you want to see how it develops.Sometimes the entire genre shifts like HxH, DB, Negi, Madoka, etc.I remember in an English class reading that Chinese writing usually eases you into the writing before getting to the point at the very end. Sometimes I feel anime does the same damn thing.
1i'm so very sorry for you. being afraid of your own mind is truly tragic.
1This is most of my life. I have too much ADD to actually do anything, so I just refresh internet pages, walk around the block, and think about nonsense.
3Love Live huh? I got to the end of the first ep when they randomly broke into song and dropped it like a bad habit. That shit was too ridiculous. Is that show just not for me, or does it somehow completely change five episodes in? Up until that point I was like "eh, the writing is okay but I don't like the art style."
7...shit is that was ADD is
If you're watching anime on a seasonal basis and want to get an impression of nearly everything, then three episodes is two too many. If you're following someone's recommendation, three episodes is a good rule of thumb although longer series may deserve more.
8I wish there were actual "broke out in song" anime. Love Live did not scratch my itch.
7that's how I became a nihilist
6 If you're watching anime on a seasonal basis and want to get an impression of nearly everything, then three episodes is two too manyNot really. if you start with thirty I think generally you can rule at least ten or so out from the start, that's an hour and a half a day. Easily doable.
6I guess if you are cycling through anime that is being released this season the three ep rule is an adequate filter.But if you finish all your seasonal anime and find that one of the anime you dropped went all balls-to-the-wall or was talked about fondly by the people who watched the whole thing you should consider finishing itAs for series already done 3 ep rule should not to be applied
0problem is that is only going to happen in 1/50 shows that I'd drop because I thought it was garbage.I'd rather drop it and pick it up again depending on what people talk about it
7Doesn't sound like ADD really...4and this makes no sense either
1I actually enjoy it a lot, just wished I didn't get depressed every time I did it because my life is so shitty, but I don't think that would be a problem if things got better.
8I suppose it's not so much that it changed, I just started to really enjoy the characters are the way they interacted with each other. The second season is mainly what I'm referring to though, I thought it balanced drama and humor nicely. It's rare for me to find a show with drama that doesn't feel forced, and that's one thing I have to give to Love Live.1Eh, I liked the way it ended honestly. I enjoy a good misanthropic moral.
3soundmakes no sensespoken like someone without ADD
7though even though some series that does get a good start can become good with just a few details, the opposite can also happen.With Serials, usually the first act just sets up shit, the second arc actually puts their cards on the table, and the third wraps it up. Because of this the first few episodes can be a surprisingly bad indicator of what's to come.
2I don't think ADD has anything to do with not being able to handle being alone with your thoughts, more that you can't concentrate.
1I agree with you, but I'm not going to watch 30 bad shows to discover a good one because of that. I usually just drop it and pick it back up if someone says it gets better.
5you misread the post then.
2Somewhere along the way, probably.
2If your mind is strong enough to convince you to the appeal of nihilism, you should fear your own mind.Once you have thought about how insignificant your existence is and the ramifications, you need an escape. Anime provides that to some people.
18Is it that bad; I'm intrigued should I marathon it for shits and giggles or would the psychological torture be too much?
2What are your thoughts on the 'Three Episode Rule', /a/?The three episode rule was created as a means to deal with posters in /a/ who are quick to condemn a show after watching a few minutes or who have short term memory problems. People who are relatively patient and don't use terms like "this is total shit" probably don't need to use the three episode rule.
I watch the first episode. That's all i need to do.
Its a dumb rule for dumb people that need others to guide their opinion of anime series.
3first episode is even worsemost anime don't even do anything in their first episode and the few that do tend to jump the shark
2It's not even "so bad it's good" bad, it's just insufferable. The whole otaku teacher thing is fucking stupid as hell, the teacher is obnoxious, and the art, oh god the art. I went in expecting nothing and yet getting nothing would have been preferable.
2There weren't any EDs for the first two episodes when it aired.
3I've consumed a lot of mediocre shows that end up having very little pay off. Booze helps a lot to this end at least if the show has some comedic elements it works wonders. If you get bored half way through a show and you just aren't engaged at all don't ever feel like you are missing out on something. Drop it and find something you like.
4or learn how to deal with it. it isn't some unsolvable problem. it's actually on the pathway to freedom and higher learning.
I follow the "Too straight for me" rule. I watch the intro and for every pair of huge bouncing boobs or panty shots I add a tally mark, 5 tally marks and I'm done. Shirtless/mostly nude and lewd men can reduce the tally marks though.Like this shit... I have no interest in watching it.
2all I have learned from my mind is that ahahahahhah fuck that shit I don't even know what the hell I am, I just like anime and video games and arguing about them with anonymous fags
0Watching anime with your dick is kinda gay.
2^this. people should know themselves what they are getting into watching the show instead of people telling them how much episode they should watch before deciding to drop or not.
I have diffrent rules for when a show is airing or if I'm watching it in batch form. For airing shows it generally goes:1: Was the first ep enough to get your interest, Y/N? If Y, Go to 2. If N, at least watch one more to decide if it's not your thing. Exceptions apply here.2: Is it still good after three episodes, Y/N? If Y, continue to 3. If N, dropping is acceptable if it's un-interesting or un-enjoyable.3: Is it still good after 6 episodes, Y/N? Has it changed direction at this point in a desirable/undesirable way? If the answer is Y, continue to 4. If N, just drop it because at this rate the end will just suck. I've delt with enough airing anime I didn't like but watched to the end and though "Wow, that sucked. What a waste of bandwith."4: Only for shows past 12 eps Is it good after 12 episodes, Y/N? If Y, go on, if N, just drop.My criteria for shows in batch is to watch until I'm either done or not interested anymore. Guilty Crown is an example of a show I watched in batch and dropped by episode 10 because I hated the whole damn cast and pretty animation can't save shit writing,
8you aren't arguing. you're just acting like an idiot to avoid discussion.
8But I wasn't the poster you were replying to though.
0DxD is probably the straightest show I've ever seen in my life. They literally defeat an enemy with the power of boobs in one episode.
2What are your thoughts on the 'Three Episode Rule'The rule is for retards who can't think for themselves and need to constantly ask "what does /a/ think of"
2That's kinda the point.
8Ahhh george. This is not the words of george. Also people act like an idiot here because it is fun not to avoid anything from a bunch of people who don't even have their brains fully developed, and older people who are in a likewise mental capacity, most likely.I know one user of this board. He is a really cool guy.2Hm I don't know I just do what I want OP. Usually I'll watch movies though. I can't just absorb seasons like when I was in school. Not that what I'm doing with my life requires dedication, continued training or ability, or even trying.
6It's good throughout but if someone prefers a more serious tone they'd need to get to Yorkshin for max enjoyment.
2The 3 episode "rule" is bullshit. If you watched 3 episodes of Samurai Flamenco and stopped because it was too realistic and slice of life for you, you would sound like a retard. If you want to stop after 3 episodes because something seemed like it wouldn't appeal to you that is fine, just don't pretend you know anything about it or can objectively say how shit it is.
2when a show is shit I don`t even give it a 2nd episode.
2It's pretty unsolvable since the problem's perceived solution is unique for every individual. This leads some to think they've come up with a solution.It's interesting that you bring up higher learning because you can see the same type of situation occur there. As people learn more, they don't necessarily become more happy. In fact, the opposite is often true.
8Samurai FlamencoSamurai Flamenco is soooo over-rated on /a/.
23 Episode rule is for fags who can't fucking make up their minds on what they watch.
6I prefer using the 3 episode rule than reading reviews or trusting the taste of /a/.
6Lots of good anime start like shit. A bunch of faggots decided on the 3ep rule after getting their jimmies rustled by bebe
2I've never dropped a show in my life.I'm still watching Denpa Kyoushi, Sailor Moon Crystal and World Trigger.And yes I have seen at least an average amount of anime for an /a/non around 400.
3I feel like it's perfectly balanced on /a/ with those who thinks it's shit and those who say otherwise. It's an average series imo
I use 3 episode rule for 12 ep. anime and 8 episode rule for 24+ ep anime.there is also this "strange phenomenon" where 24+ episode anime that starts to pickup in 3 episodes tend to have shitty ends. Maybe it's because the pacing is rushed, but I think that's just me...
For me i think it's a pacing issue, There's a bunch of anime where the first episode or two don't really dictate how or where the anime is headed. Ga-Rei-Zero or Hataraku Maou-sama come to mind right now but i'm sure i've had more also.
I'll generally give an anime a 3rd episode deadline to make me care. So yeah, you could say i'm okay with it. Shows like Gunbuster a classic that gave Eva it's soda macines and gifted us with the wondrous thing known as boob physics take around 3 episodes to introduce characters and do some world building before letting us dive into the knitty gritty of it all. It all depends on what the show does with it's first three episodes. If I can obviously tell it's gonna be bullshit then i'm out, but if there's something that's grabbing my attention and making me care then of course i'm gonna stick around.
lol 3 episode rule. Grow some balls fags!!
I don't like the three episode rule. With most shows, I know immediately if I'm going to like it or not. Plot twists that make me reevaluate the show happen rarely. The last one that comes to mind was Yuuki Yuuna, and in such cases, there's so much hype that I'll hear about it anyway, so I can pick those up later.
The 3 episode rule.The real rule is everything except the last five minutes that ruin everything.

A little slow there.
I hope Fubuki ends up breaking her limiter at some point, it seems to be set up that way.
0Fuck off blondecuck
7I wish you faggots would stop spewing about limiters. The only way to gain massive power in OPM is to become a monster based upon your passion, like psychos did. But even then you could still end up weak as shit like her. This isn't a shounen where anyone can become super special and better than everybody out of nowhere.
8I thought it was? People end up getting their wish, but most people end up dreaming small.
2I don't know if Fubuki wants to be strong or would rather just have real friends rather than underlings or her controlling sister. While she didn't love her role in Rank-B, she didn't really hunger for higher ranks either, she just wanted to have people around who weren't her sister.
is OP's image ONE's art? he's gotten a lot better holy shit
6Yeah, but still...
2Breaking your limiter only gives you a small power boost, it makes you stronger than you were even supposed be, but after that you have unlimited potential, so as long as you keep on training/fighting you will keep getting stronger.
So I'm currently reading Mob psycho. Is the original OPM's art better or worse than this?
0usually worse but there's some really detailed panels that near that level
0Way worse. ONE has gotten much better over the years, and besides, he never put equal amount of efforts for OPM as he does Mob, which is understandable since MP100 was a professional serialization from the start, where as OPM was literally just doodles on his homepage.
Does One hate opm now that it got an anime before his favourite and preferred mob psycho 100?

So I just started Last Exile, what am I in for?
5Harem. Not even kidding.

6Really? What I'm getting so far is that its the Napoleonic Wars in a dieselpunk universe.
So do Lavie and Klaus fug at least?
3No.Klaus becomes crippled later but Lavie takes care of him. Titania goes off flying for her own things. Sophia never really want the Klaus dick.And Dio? Is Dio.
The first series: a good story with cool air battles.The second series: disappointment interspersed with Dio doing cool shit.
9I think it's safe to assume that they did it at some point. Klaus did not become crippled at the end of season 1, it happened sometime before season 2.
7Crippled from too much sex.
Should've tapped this.
oh god please don't watch the sequels
It was enjoyable and fun to watch up to the second half, where it became battling with galactic aliens and tentacle rocks.
7I am Ok with that.
5After you finish it once, rewatch it.A lot of things become apparent and the effort they put into world building really shines then.
5LE is pretty cool, but S2 Fan of the SIlver Wing or something like that is bad.

WHY BONER WHY?
How does the adaptation fare compared to the manga?
It's cutting out stuff and sped up, no surprise there.Piss scene is in, but the part where she asks if that turns him on is out. Shit like that.
I don't remember details from the early chapters of the manga, but anime's pacing seems fine. As far as adaptation goes it's pretty good.I'm cool as long as they finish the story after the first arc, and not let this drag out to the Yamada and 21 witches borefest it is right now.
1Except episode 7, there's no obvious rushing.

Is the manga truly better than the anime? Also thoughts. I personally think this is one of the best animes from this season, and so far all time. Even though Soma is OP, I do not find his victories to be of diminishing excitement, and the harem/ecchi aspect seems to be kept well in check. Each episode seems to further the plot, and are not just suspense cock blocks. Feels refreshing, balanced, and really sucks me into each episode.
You're fucking stupid dude.
and so far all time
6Its by far AOTS. Wouldn't say of all time but its closeTheres no harem in it.
6and so far all time.
Also Soma is hot. I'd let him fuck me.
6and so far all time
OP, I guess I need to elaborate a bit, I put it in my top anime of all time, because it feels refreshing, it doesn't fuck with my head, or with my feels. I find it very entertaining and, with the semi-credible cooking directions it incorporates, novel. I'm not saying it is a work of art or anything, but it definitely does the job I expected it to. And for that I highly regard it, because it sucks me in without fucking with my head or anything like that, I can just enjoy it.

It is kind of like this anime, just refreshing, and deserving of the all-time title.
5In the anime he hasn't technically lost yet.
6The mistake you made, OP, is to come to /a/ and try to have an actual discussion on any anime, or share your positive feelings about one.This cesspool is entirely focused on shitting on every anime, every post, and every living or dead human beings in existence.
4I have realized this too late, I mostly stick around /f/, should have lurked more.
4You don't fucking start a thread by saying '' LOL THIS IS THE BEST THING EVAR!!!'' and start acting like a complete fucking newfag.

4It's not that at all.OP argues the quality of the anime with his personal feelings instead of any objective, tangible attributes the show makes evident.His "opinion" is worthless and comes down to the flavor of the month show I like the most is a masterpiece.

86This isn't your anime blog.4There already is a thread for SnS up, you are free to join the discussion.
6Soma gets his shit pushed in all the time when goes against people with actual talent. He's just mostly been cooking against low rank pawns in the anime so far.That said, the anime is pretty much using the manga as story boards. It's pretty much the exact same thing. They expand a bit on the reactions since most of them only really take up 1-2 panels in the Manga, but that's nothing.

04Try harder. If you're triggered by making blanket statement about /a/ like this, you know you're actually aware that you are doing exactly what I said. This forums has been getting worse and worse every year.
6Fuck off.You won't be missed.
7I do agree that enthusiastic, subjective praise of an anime doesn't do anything constructive to the table. But you also know deep down that what I said is true as well.

3Haha what? Dude, we're speaking English here. If we were to be 100% correct we would call itcartoons made in JapanBut that would be a hassle every time. But calling itanimeinstead ofanimesis just as inaccurate.Again, because we're speaking fucking English and aren't in Japan.

6Is the manga truly better than the anime?animesand so far all time. All that combined with this post 4
7Soma follows the shounen battle manga mainstream to a tee. The battle to gain friends, defeats against top tiers and aim to be better, rival peers, etc. It is NOTHING like SAO, which follows a standard wish-fulfillment Mary Sue webnovel standard. or rather, birthed the narrative that became standard of webnovelsIf you want to shit on Soma by comparing its generic qualities to something else, by all means do so, but at least do so with the correct fucking subject. Otherwise you just make yourself look ignorant and stupid.

6Better. I'm a little disappointed that Naruto was the first image of a generic shounen you could think of, but it's understandable.To be honest Soma's genericness feels a lot older tradition, like, Saint Seiya / Kinnikuman age cliche. or oudou as they call it in JapanIt's like take all the common themes of the standard shounen and use food as theme. Which isn't a bad thing, it's just shounen battle manga with food. And it's not like it's trying to be anything else.
6Anime has been incorporated into the English dictionary already.

5Pretty sure he's talking about the fact that he came for some spoiler-free discussion, but there's no discussion in the thread period.
6I hope this is bait, but assuming it isn't and you're just retarded, let's break it down a little bit.One of the best animes this seasonanimesThere are a few better shows airing this season, but admittedly this is in the top 10 probably.and so far all timeI don't even know what to say to this.Even though Soma is OPRead the manga, idiot. Souma loses a ton. The whole point is he learns from his failures and they make him a better chef.Is the manga betterStupid question. There are very few series that are better than their source manga.All in all, 4/10 bait OP. Made me reply.
2There are a few better shows airing this seasonNot him but out of curiosity, what other shows this season do you consider better?
9I think it's safe to say that, objectively speaking, Yahari, Ore Monogatari, and Hibike! are just done better, and there are a few others that are airing that I'm just enjoying a bit more as well, but those are subject to taste, obviously.
2I was thinking of giving Hibike! a try because I see so many threads about it but always gave it a miss because the description just makes it sound like K-ON!But I'll give it a go now that you recommended it. Right after I finish the Fate/Stay Night visual novel.
92I ended up just following Hibike, Soma, Yamada, and OreMonoWhich is odd considering I'm not all that fond of highschool setting, but these four just ended being my top picks.
2I should add, I don't think Shokugeki is shit, but the manga is way better, and it's by no means the best anime of the season, let alone all time.
7It's most definitely re-molded from the book to give a K-ON impression. Character molds were drastically changed for that exact goal. But the actual show itself is entirely different. It's not "four girls doing random cute things", it's actually entirely focused on band activities and music. The intentional similarities to K-ON is a facade that pretty much ends on the surface.
7I thought it was going to be just like K-On, which I would have loved, because I fucking love K-On, but it's undeniably it's own entity. Even if the story isn't your thing, the seiyuu work is great, and the directing is really well done as well. Hope you like it.4I'm a sucker for SOL/high school shit, honestly. Love Hibike! so far, and OreMono is adorable. Souma is good, but admittedly has it's problems. I like Yamada a lot, and it has the OP of the season, but I'm not a fan of how rushed it is.

You know, if you just set aside the fact that Onii-sama is magical batman jesus, this was a pretty damn good series.Excellent animationGood voice actingSolid OPs/EDs/OSTFaithful to source materialLots of worldbuildingEvery girl is best girlBest imoutoCharacter development across the boardS2 when
Don't forgetfucking boring
3It's maybe a little slow.
2Get rid of magical batman jesus and you have no show. Onii-sama is the lord and savior of anime
Onii-sama was fun to watchDidn't really give a shit about anyone else
The scene where he dances with his harem is my favorite scene in an anime
You know, if you just set aside the fact that Onii-sama is magical batman jesusOnii-sama is the best part about Mahouka, faggot.
Only decent girls were Mari and Mizuki, for not being part of the harem.Though even that was pretty fucking questionable.

I feel like it had too many characters and everything between the end of the first arc and the fight against Cardinal George and blood prince dude was a drag.
13oh god what just happened?
1Sasuga Onii-sama
2I never watched the show, but I'll always have a soft spot for this webm.
2How? The story is still boring and the character is still shit. And you can't rid this show of Onii-sama because he is the center of everything in this show, this show is basically " Lick Tatsuya's ass" The Show. You cut Tatauya out and this show and this so called world building that LNfag so proud about is all for nothing.
Mayumi best character.Kinda sucks that her magic was so underwhelming as student council president of the most elite magic high school though.
5I cant even remember what it was it was that shit
3I disagree. If you look at the immediate conflicts presented in the show, then yeah it's 100% "Sasuga Onii-sama" the animation. But he has goals of his own that don't actually involve slaughtering/nuking the chinese, such as living a peaceful life with his sister and creating a world where magicians are more than just weapons. Due to his abilities, he's not well-suited to accomplish either of those goals, and in that respect he struggles more than any other character.
5I liked Mikihiko, he would have made a good foil to Tatsuya had they focused more on him.
3boringI marathoned it. I don't usually marathon animes. The last ones I marathoned were Maria, Sidonia S1
I liked when out if nowhere it turned into WW3 for a few episodes
7Miyuki 2lewd
Top scenes in Mahouka, in order :1. Dancing scene2. Demon Light scene with No Head Dragon members3. Duel with Masaki4. "Molecular Divider"5. Miyuki's flying scene6. Millenario
I still can't take the show as seriously as I used to since it finally sunk in that Onii-sama is SIXTEEN.
Too bad we won't ever see animated reactions of other characters when they learn Onii-sama is a Yotsuba.
7Can't wait Lina vs Onii-sama.If we ever get S2 ;__;
2The voice acting was weird.
Try to chill every once and a while. It's good for you.
Ruri a shit
A whole month of jail episodes.
HA HA, TIME FOR BUTCH JAIL BIRDS
2Wrong.
6If there is nothing interesting in the summaries, I'm gonna take a break until DRAGON or Friendship cup starts.
1Who's the third for the Power Trio? I know Yuya is one and Yuzu is two but who is three?I wish I could say Sora but Dennis replaced him. Gongenzaka is marketed as this but he doesn't develop as beyond "Yuya's friend". Shun is too busy looking for Ruri/working as a wheel for the still on-going Sora arc. And Reiji is way too antagonistic as a rival.Any opinions about it?
6At least it's getting knocked out of the way all at once and it's only 4 episodes, unlike the qualification arc that was double that with the addition of actually interesting episodes in between.
HANASE MONSTAAA
7I forgot to mention that I consider Sawatari comic relief, not power trio material.
7Reiji or Gon. No other real options.
6One other thing, since this is the cover of the single for the third opening for the arc where Yuzu is separated from both Yuya and Gon, I'm predicting that they'll all be together by the end of the arc again and potentially do something as a trio.
6Gongenzaka needs an arc or else I would also want him REMOVED.It's unfair, Sora was fine as a character, Gongenzaka is just there.And Reiji needs to be more friendly if he wants to be part of a power trio or I don't know what I'm gonna do. Fucking karma houdini.
7But we always knew Sora wasn't going to be like that. Also I hate to compare Gon with fucking Crow, but Crow didn't really do that much either despite being in the power trio.
7Gongenzaka is literally Yuy'a only moral support.
9One dumb thing doesn't make another dumb thing in characterWell true, but the opposite is also true. Just because she's acting stupid in different ways doesn't mean that one of the actions isn' t in character.She didn't talk about the Yuto thing because it confused and scared her. In fact I consider that more out of character because she really had no reason to keep it a secret from everyone and bringing everyone so much trouble because of it. She was acting retarded there literally to just halt the plot. But acting like a doomsday hobo also makes sense considering Yuzu's personality. There is no reason for her to keep the Academia thing a secret and she always acts immediately when she thinks of doing something. Like when she followed Sawatari into that abadoned warehouse because she wanted to beat him up. She's impulsive and doesn't think alot about the consequences of her actions. Same when she broke the Solid Vision of their school. That's her character.
6Gon. He's had more duels than Yuzu by now
7There isn't a power trio this time, just a bunch of dummies, Un-Yugioh as fuck.
9Crow actually has his own plot eventhough it isn't much such as MUH CHILDREN, getting Black-winged Dragon and Legendary D-Wheeler.Gon's character just revolves around Yuya.
1She's impulsive and doesn't think alot about the consequences of her actionsSounds like Serena. Must be the same to all Ruris then considering Yuto said Yuzu and Ruri are similar, not just in appearance but in personality too.
The translator on NAC is busy right now, but they did manage to translate the episode titles.60: No Cards, No Pardon 地獄の沙汰もカード次第, Jigoku no Sata mo Kādo Shidai61: The Man who Threw Away a Draw ドローを捨てた男, Dorō o suteta otoko62: The Big Entertainment Duel Tournament!! 大エンタメデュエル大会!!, Dai entamedyueru taikai!63: King of Captors - "Goyo King" 捕獲者の王「ゴョ ウ・キング」, Hokaku-sha no ō `Goyou kingu'
2Is Ushio gonna make a cameo?
2I wish the last one was Ushio, but won't happen.
3I wonder how Yugo and Rin even survived so far
A month of jail episodes
5Only by one or two. Really, most of the relevant non-protagonists have a similar amount of duels.
8If this guy can appear in Arc-V I'm almost certain about any 5D's character can
3Vegeta in the background
2Rin ended up maturing quicker to take care of Yugo.
Yuzu is dumbNo, she is perfectShe is a Mary Suedoomsday hoboWould you all kindly shove a large black cock down your throat to shut it?
5Watch your language Yuya
5People call her dumb because she acts dumb.People call her Mary Sue because characters are irrationally obsessed with her even though her character doesn't justify such strong emotions.It's not a contradiction
3 VS esper rouba
0The only characters who are obsessed with her are Serena and Yuuya, Leon kinda counts since he needs her for her planirrationally obsessedNow that's just dumb.
6Dinosaur HakozakiPirates KeithTo think someone fucked rex raptor.
5No anon, she's a dumbass and a mary sue, and you're not allowed to have an opinion otherwise.
9tfw no pirates keith in arc-vyarr, 'tis a heartbreaking thing, me matey
8Well she's a dumbass that's for sure.
2Episode 61: The Man who Threw Away a DrawWhile the people of the detention facility watch on, Yuuya and Tokumatsu Chojiro began their intense Duel. Using the “Tokumatsu Lethal Combo” that allows him to draw and cut away Life Points, Tokumatsu drives Yuuya into a corner.
5And Yuto and Masumi and Shun and Yugo and Sora and every single character she ever even remotely talked to
2The Man who Threw Away a DrawBecause of the Japanese I assume this is 'draw' as in 'drawing a card' rather than the result of a duel.TournamentOh joy, because the last time we had one of those it went so wellGoyo KingIs Goyo finally going to be an archetype?
7Gongenzaka needs an arc or else I would also want him REMOVED.It's unfair, Sora was fine as a character, Gongenzaka is just there.What does Sora fading into the background have to do with Gon? They did what they wanted to for the moment with Sora, now they're doing other stuff, he'll come back later in the show2She matured in all the right places0I think she's both dumb and not a Sue, Serena isnt even that obsessed with her she's focusing on finding strongu duelists now. And Yuya hadnt gone MUH YUZU is a few episodes
9Serena isnt even that obsessed with her she's focusing on finding strongu duelists now.I agree. It was really bad at the beginning of this arc, but things seem to calm down now
7She's impulsive, but she's not as dumb as people keep trying to act like she is. She does a few dumb things on occasion mainly with stuff she doesn't understand fully, but it's not as big a deal as people make it out as, nor is it any worse than what other characters tend to do. But apparently I'm not allowed to argue that she has her flaws but isn't actually as dumb as people keep saying, otherwise I want her to be a mary sue.
9that allows him to draw and cut away Life PointsAw shitMaybe I'll be able to revive my Simochi deck
2The Yuus are understandable, Shun is a fucking siscon, Yuzu was the disciple of Sora so of course he's interested in her.every single character she ever even remotely talked toGon doesn't really care about her, he's all over Yuuya, and she's just a target for Dennis.
9He's right about Gon needing development. As much as I like him, he still needs development that doesn't involve Yuya. Heck a lot of characters need development. Practically everyone on the Lancers.
This synchro arc sucks. as expected of the second worst summoning method bar ritual.
7That was just a bait. He used the same argument over and over again even when people already point out holes in his argument.
2Masumi She didnt even mention her in her last appearance, and before that she only acknowledged her precence when Yuya asked them about ShunShun They met once, he pushed her over, went MUH RURI, and hasnt given her a second thought outside of being disgusted a Ruri used fusion since.YugoThey're just travelling together, he's a hardcore RinfagSora He just taught her fusion, he didnt even care when she saw him go evil and didnt mention her in his duel with Yuya8But I dont see people act like she's massively dumb, they give her shit over the Yuto thing occasionally, it barely comes up anymore and doomsday hobo because it was hilarious but its nothing more than other characters get, she isnt being picked on
7The next episodes are so uninteresting people want to argue about Yuzu instead even though the next ones aren't even about her.
8She does a lot of stupid things and gets called out for it. What's the big deal? People call Serena and Sawatari retarded all the time, but only Yuzufags defend Yuzu so badly, even though she arguably acts more retarded than Serena and Sawatari
2Sawatari may be retarded, heck, even Neo New Sawatari is. But that is not true for Shin-Neo New Sawatari
2even though she arguably acts more retarded than Serena and SawatariIt's shit like this, I'm not even a Yuzufag I'm a Selenafaggot, but this isn't even close. Also, the only thing she was called out on was the Yuto thing, by Gon, many episodes after she got over it.
4How is Yuzu acting any smarter than Serena or Sawatari?
6Goyo was already an Archetype what with the Security's decks being Goyo themed. I want Sniping Hazy Type-0 to be released since it would most likely be a good level 7 generic to go into that pays for itself when it leaves the field. I wonder if Goyo King is a level 8 Synchro and the boss of the Goyo Archetype what with Chaser being level 5 1900 ATK that SS the monster it destroys with half its attack points and Predator being a level 6 2400 ATK that SS the monster it destroys in ATK mode and Guardian that is also level 6 2800 ATK that SS the monster it destroys in DEF mode. Will Goyo King be a 3000 ATK+ level 8 that can basically be a improved version of Chaser that can tribute the monsters it kills if it itself gets destroyed by effect or battle?
8Makes me wonder when the Ass Force are going to come back and spread Fusion's love and happiness to Synchro.
7I get a feeling the director tried referencing 5D's season 1 and mimic the episodes outline too much. The Friendship cup probably only start around episodes 65ish and ends in 10 episodes.
2Yuzu shared the information she had with Yugo to keep any misunderstandings from happening.
3Goyo was already an Archetype what with the Security's decks being Goyo themedThey actually arent. The technical definition of an archtype requires then to have at least one support or anti support card that references the entire archetype i.e. a spell card that gives all Goyo monsters 500 extra attack. Its why Dragon Rulers arent actually an archtype, they're a series
2She didn't get FTKed yet and actually ran away when outclassed.
Why were Yuto and Shun after LDS in the beggining of the series? How did Shun know Akaba Leo if everyone from Academia refers to him only as "Professor"?
9Shun wanted to kidnape Reiji to exchange him with Ruri.Leo Akaba's name is not hidden or anything. Considering Resistance stole some Academia's tech, they probably find out Leo's name from those.
9They found an LDS badge. Leo seems to use them too for his people.Dennis uses his badge to identify with the Obelisk Force as their ally
0It's not a contradiction, just plain false. There are no characters obsessed with her for no reason. The Yuzufags are Yuya and Serena, and that's where the list ends.The point was that this "argument" has been going on for over a month now. It leads nowhere and only turns helps to turn the thread into a shitposting general.
0Serena also shared information with the lancers.Neo New Sawatari-san shared information with Security
6Got be to chuckle
unf
4Yuzu also isn't trying to ram her cock down the police's throat to get information, unlike Selena.
Here's the last batch of translationsEpisode 62: The Great Entertainment Duel TournamentSince the Duel between Yuuya and Tokumatsu, the inmates have become more lively. Meanwhile, Shinji suggests that Yuuya should participate in the “Great Entertainment Duel Tournament.”Episode 63: The King of Captors - Goyo KingYuuya and co. was heading outside the detention facility. A pursuit squad chased after them and summoned their Goyo Monsters, quickly cornering them.
2MasumiCan you people stop confusing fanart with reality?
2YutoShe stalked her because she looked like Ruri and he feels quitly about shit. MasumiRivalShunAre you dumb? When did Shun care after "Are you Ruri?" She watched her Fusion Summon to make sure Yuto was right and never bothered with her againYugoHe cares about his Rin. In fact, he treats her pretty shitty.SoraOh, you are dumb. She begged him to be her mentor, he hastily accepted and that's all. They didn't even interact after Sora came backNow, please tell me how Sawatari, Gon, Reiji, Mieru and the rest of the characters that have been around Yuzu are obsessed with her.
9ram her cock down the police's throatThis is true crude, strong shenanigans.
7So I'm guessing this "tournament" is leading to a prison break?
7Great Entertainment Duel TournamentTournaments all up in this shit
7Shinji suggests that Yuuya should participate in the “Great Entertainment Duel Tournament.”It's like every day the Synchro arc seems like it's going to be longer and longer.
5Serena will never ram her futa cock down my throatDammit /d/ stop giving me a boner.
7I guess this is where the wacky adventures start. Just along with Shinji and Crow though.
7The fun has just began.
4Yuri go to bed.
1Get used to it. This arc will likely be 50+ episodes. I don't think we'll leave Synchro too soon. Jack hasn't even been introduced yet and the arc is only beginning to set up it's plot.Who knows what conspiriacies might exist in Synchro World.Also Riding Duels seem to stick around for longer
TOURNAMENT teams, discuss:Yuya, Gon, CrowShun, Serena, BENNIS :DDDDReira, Ninja, ReijiYugo, Yuzu, Sawatari
Who the hell is Tokumatsu? Shinji?
5Some prison guy, the same guy the preview for next episode mentions.Basically the new ushi-oni guy.
5The Himuro expy aka prison's toughest guy character.
5Tokumatsu is a new character. Probably the warden. Shinji Webber is that guy who brought candies to the kids this episode.

5Tokumatsu must be one of the inmates. He has a burn deck of some sort.
5Shun teaming up with YugoDidn't he still think Yugo is Pawn of Fusion or something? I don't think they will get along anyway even if Shun stop believing Yugo is an enemy.
1teamsI doubt is gonna be a team.
5BIG BLACK ____
1He probably thinks he killed Yuto, since for Shun all things in life are more important than fucking asking Yuya about it.
1Pretty sure this isn't a WRGP thing
1If Yuto within Yuya's body tells Shun that Yugo is an ally, then Shun must accept Yugo as an ally. 9ASS
9I would hope it is though
1If Crow is going to at least have a slight semblance to 5D's Crow that's friends with Jack, he's probably not going to enter due to him and their history of some sort.Yuya, Gon, SawatariReiji, Reira, SerenaShun, Ninjabro, DennisAlternatively,Reiji, Reira, DennisShun, Ninjabro, SerenaJudging from the last part of the OP.
9IRON CHAINSTfw new support never7If Crow is going to at least have a slight semblance to 5D's Crow that's friends with Jack, he's probably not going to enter due to him and their history of some sort.He's enter to tell him he isnt living his life correctly
5But Yuya believes the same thing, too.
4 Crow and Jack had some great interactions, mostly because Jack is a lazy piece of shit who's only good to be rich and do nothing but dueling.
2Well, Yuya didn't start getting worried when he found out Yuzu was with Yugo, so I dunno.
174Crow can't enter the tournament. If you get the mark you will remain a Commons forever. Of course, Chess-kun could make exceptions for those with the new Summon methods.
4Crow defeats JackJack crashesCrow rushes over to himkneels next to himhe raises Jack and whispers something into his ear, smiling as he does so"Check your privileges"
9NOSTRILS
7That job episode as Jack comes to the realization of how unemployable he isThen he beat up some mobsters and all was well7If you get the mark you will remain a Commons foreverNobody has said that. I presume they dont intend for anyone to actually beat Jack instead preferring to use the slim possibility of advancement to keep the majority Commons in line. So I cant see why they wouldnt let marked citizens enter and lose like everyone else
1Some of the 5ds second half dumb filler was so amazing in all the wrong ways.
1Yugo said if you go to Facility, you can't participate in Friendship Cup. But that could just mean you couldn't participate because you are in jails.
6Jack trying to get a job was seriously god tier. It's on the same level as Goku and Piccolo trying to get a drivers license
When does ygopro update anyway? I want to test out Yuya and Reiji's new cards.
1It helps that Jack is basically one bit manchild with the same mindset as the kids Crow takes care of.
0 I want to test their new batch of bugs
I told you stupid fuckers that Synchro would last throughout summer.
4So if Synchro got 30-50 episodes, does this mean Academia is final villains and no other villains after that?
9God, please not him. The shock treatments I can forgive, that's just typical american police brutality but the nosehairs? That alone deserves a carding. So fucking gross. Oh my god.
6Academia can be the final setting, but there's no way Leo is the final villain.
6The Academia part can last less than 20 episodes. Leo will probably be beaten by around 100, giving ~50 more episodes for stuff, which is still plenty, fuck that's still more than most anime get nowadays.
6Standard was 50 episodes, so I guess Synchro and Academia both get 50 each. No Xyz
1YGO has Shonen pacing. Important duels gonna need 2-3 episodes. Considering how large the cast is, they need tons of episodes just for duels.
6I hope so.5Indeed, no motive to go to the wasteland of Heartland.
5No XyzI think we will visit Heartland at one point. There are still some mystery left. Its probably just gonna be 6-13 episodes like Astral World.
5I'm thinking the dimensions will have to fuse at some point, as it makes the most dramatic sense for the heroes to stop Leo at the final stages of his plan.So maybe we won't have a "Academia" or a "XYZ" or a "Synchro" anymore by the Endgame.
6Yuya is the final villain. Please, it's obvious.

7If only Yuya's CV enters a sex cult, will Yuzu become even more important?
Serena will never get her cards released, Yuzu will never get more Melodies, Rin won't duel at all and Ruri will just be there to trigger Shay's sister complex.
0No, Crow will
7mfw Yuya and Leo's CV's end up in a sex-cultmfw we end up getting Darkness back
3Simple steps.Next series maybe we'll get more cards played by female duelists.The next series maybe we'll get enough cards for two decks.
7Wasn't that cult arrested already?I wonder what would happen if that cult shit arise during GX season 2. Will Saiou end up killed early and Edo get possessed by Light of Destruction and become season 2 villain?
3ShayWho?
0They released Ayu and Mieru's cards over other minor characters. You could also make Masumi deck.
7If Shun's CV joins a sex cult, I will travel to Japan, screw Arc-V
0Quite it, anon. You'll trigger the people who think just because Jojo's sixth series had a female lead Yugioh will do the same.
3Rin won't duel at allWell, yeah, she's dead. Yugo's gonna get absorbed, what is she going to do, try to scold Yuya?Actually, it'll be sort of amusing if Yuya, who had absorbed Yugo as well, ends up getting scolded by Ruri, Rin and Yuzu.
7Since the Duel between Yuuya and Tokumatsu, the inmates have become more livelyOh yeah, i'm sure the women starved prisoners have been perked up by Yuyas "dueling"
7"Look at the ass on that chick!"
7I'd let him ride my Whip Viper around all night long!
3Pick up that soap, Mammoth-boy
3Confirmed jack and crow in the anime, but still not sure about yusei.
7prisoners start leering at Yuyameanwhile, Serena gets ignored
2Yusei's VA explicitly stated Yusei and Aki are too busy going on dates to appear in the Arc-V anime.
7all this mention of tournamentsbut everyone is still on the wanted list as fugitives
3Well, what does Aki's VA say?
For DT fagsWhat happened to Winda to turn into that? And did she return to normal?Also did the story ended? And if yes how?
1She had too much cock in her mouth to comment.
0Pretty dangerous, ice skating while sucking cock.
21 Exciton is accidentally corrupting everything he touches;2 Crystal - Cairngorgon, releases Shaddoll's roots;3 Roots creates Nephilim;4 Nephilim starts to possess the remaining survivors using puppet strings, catches Winda;5 During massive battles against the World Tree, Infernoids are released;6 Infernoids absorb Winda and use her as a source of energy;7 There has not been a resolution to the DT storyline yet
9I thought the Qliphorts were the ones using Winda as a battery
3Isn't Qliphort and Infernoid actually the same thing?
96 Infernoids absorb Winda and use her as a source of energyI'm gonna kill somebody if they make her another Reeze she died
3Those canisters are sources of energy for Infernoids.href="#p126457267" class="quotelink"7Qliphorts are the operating system used by the Infernoids. They're essentially a "virus" in DT, whereas the Infernoids are the unseen hand guiding them.
Why it feels so good finishing a duel with De-Fusion?
3They're essentially a "virus" in DT, whereas the Infernoids are the unseen hand guiding them.Wait what? I thought they were created by Sophia as a backup antivirus to just fuck everything up if things go titsup for her?
1Why do you worry about card games women?3I always though Qliphort were another group of enemies. Didn't know they were part of Infernoids.
1It shows your a skilled member of the Fusion master race.
1Because Yuzu did it.71"Booting in Replica Mode…An error has occurred when executing C:\sophia\zefra.exeUnknown publisher.Allow C:\tierra\qliphort.exe ? Y/N…[Y]Booting in Autonomy Mode…"Essentially, Tierra hacked into Sophia's system and is shitting it up, and since Sophia's dead, no one could stop the Qliphorts. Tierra wanted to completely dominate the system, but Exciton's nature allowed him, and the remaining survivors, to tap into Sophia's old power, which created the Zefras.
1Because it's an unexpected play, I mean, it's not a search, it's usually dead in the hand or a dead draw and most of the time, the fusion monster can finish the job on it's own, especially with battle fusion being a thing.
1Because it's a trash card that fits you perfectly
0Where can I read this all up or is it just fanfiction?

9Thanks Mr Skeletal
9And
7And then the rest is basically just educated guesses going off of card lore and art
079Why is DaiGrepher still the most tragic of card storylines?
3Shay's sister complex.Figuratively who?
8Cause he is a dumbass who wanted to fight DD lady instead of fucking her
9Crystal became Cairngorgon after his base became corrupted after too many fusions. Cairngorgon has parts from the gem knight fusion.Nephilim isnt Root's creation and neither does Nephilim catch Winda. All shaddoll monsters are controlled by strings and Winda isnt, compare it to wendigo who does have strings.Roots does turn into Grysta who then dies and its orbs get absorbed by the Naturia tree and the Qliphort network.While Shaddoll are evil having a Borg mentality they dont seem to play into the grand DT scheme. Qliphort are neutral and are run by the DT world as seen by the lore of Scout. It seems they needed Sophia in order to choose the zefra but soophia is dead so they run Tieria instead, their canisters powering the infernoids.After the orbs were absorbed into the tree they chose 2 of each DT tribe to turn into a zefra, which has purifying properties as seen in Wendigo and Core.
0Hey, you with the big thighs?Would you introduce us to your cute tomato friend?8No more than riding motorbikes while playing card games
What would be the optimal special/pendulum summon engine to bring out gate guardian? I want to make a stupid janky ass deck with my useless nigga
9I think Magicians would be the best things for itProbably just focus on Antithesis and Dragonpit, with Odd-Eyes and Skullcrobat thrown in
9Which is worse?Fusion or XYZ dimension?
5Fusion, XYZ was a cheerful paradise where everyone was having fun until those Fusion faggots showed up.
mfw Tsukikage this ep
5
6
4Why did they decide to attack the XYZ dimension first? Why is it taking them so long to attack Synchro? Are they afraid of them or what?
8
1XYZ was a peaceful utopia. Synchro is a fascist police state. Obviously it's much more difficult to invade the latter than the former since one of them is already militarized.
1
3source on that?
1From what Yuto said, Xyz was very defenseless. Its Standard without Reiji or LDS around to protect it.Synchro has organised fighting force and the Commons lived in dog-eat-dog world so they are probably stronger than average Xyz duelist pre-invasion.
0But XYZ successfully harnessed the power of Kattobingu, while Synchro only scratched the surface of the power of kizuna
3Kattobingu is dead. Resistance fight using power of standing on the EDGE.
541Yup, fusion worse, it had zero ship even though they live in island
9Yusei's V.A's twitter.
3Presumably Astral, the Barians, Yuma, and the Numbers don't exist in this Heartland.Fans may criticize Yuma's character but his extra deck and ZEXAL CHANGE gets shit done.
21Images of Selena and Yuri like this always make me giggle. Too bad it probably wont be what their relationship is like if they meet.
7Just his Gagaga's and Utopia bullshit. The rest is all rank 3's rank 5 and 6 useless crap,
4Big EyeVolcasaurusMachu MachuShockmaster
2Not his. Numbers are Numbers, the only Number that is rightfully his is Utopia and all of it's forms.
7The magic of Yuri and Selena is how their relationship will develop into something. It's obvious they're gonna be close by the end of the series.
7I guess that what happened when you fall in love with same person again , again and again.The second you meet her/him, you enter late marriage relation state relation on spot...
2What are things that he never usesEven though his cards are specifically made to allow him to make XYZ monsters of rank 1-8 easily
4Gauntlet Launcher is legit
In-universe XYZ is the power of chaos taking shape, Synchro is momentum?, and Fusion is whatever it is. Which would you say has more raw potential?
9Not like you need anything but Hope Zexal.
7
0Synchro makes an infinite supply of killer robots that destroyed the planet, I'd say they take the prize
7
0and Fusion is whatever it isDimensional UnionIn terms of raw power Fusion, then XYZ, then Synchro 2Momentum draws on the bonds of human relationships, it's literally NUCLEAR FEELS.
0Fusion is the power of alchemy nya.
3We'll never get his cards.
3He gave us Macro, that's pretty significant
3Steve overheard talk that they need art for 4 new cards for next week's episodeHe was overjoyed, realizing that he can finally get the recognition he deserves as an artistHe says "I got this", opens MSPaint, and gets started on his masterpieces
If you can choose just one Yuu**.Which one will you chose?
0Pendulum, duh? If freakin Sawatari can pick them up and use them, they require no matter manipulation and just require raw skill to master.Xyz Monsters are cosmic. Their stars Levels have to align to be able to summon them, thus making the duelist require balance and intense thought, shown in Shun with his iron determination. Ranking them up requires knowledge of chaos.Synchro requires a Tuner Monster, whose levels probably have a different matter composition than that of regular monsters, letting momentum freely flow through, perfectly tuning the monsters to have a new creature be born out of the frequency. Traveling at high speeds can accelerate this process, allowing stronger, true Synchro Monsters to be born. As the only canon outer summoning requirement in the series, one must learn Clear Mind to Accel Synchro. My theory with Fusion is that the user must keep the whirlpool spinning to fuse, and can turn it different ways to fuse the monsters into different forms Flame Wingman and Phoenix Enforcer, Wolf and Tiger, etc and I'm guessing that monsters that aren't fused properly can become either unusable misfits or insanely strong abominations.
8Yugo, he's like a dog. Intensely loyal if a bit slow and dopey.
6and I'm guessing that monsters that aren't fused properly can become either unusable misfits or insanely strong abominations.That explains this thing
8Yuri because he reminds me of myself. Intelligent, nihilistic and a wicked sense of humor
1They ARE unique, you've gotta give them that.
1pic relatedyou
8
8Yuri. I would love to carry him in my arms.
2So would the complete version resemble Chimeratech Overdragon except the heads are random Fluffal monsters with blades sticking out?Or would that be the Level 9 Frightfur Hydra which will never happen.yfw Sora makes Frightfur monsters that instead of ripping stuffed animals apart, it rips humans or human-like beings apart? Just imagine doing that to the Melodious monsters.I don't even know what I am on anymore.
9It will be funny if you have to do something because alter version of you in different dimension done that
8Yuu. I suppose Yuu really should have expected this answer.But seriously, the TRUE answer is Yuri because Fusion users are the best entertainers, Fusions are the most fun summoning method, and because Yuri is the lewdest Yu even if you ignore the fact his name is literally "girls love".
Why they xyz summon do does the galaxy portal look red for non shay or uto duelers? That would of been a nice nod just like how any pendulums that aren't Yuya don't have the pendulum swaying back and forth.
The lancers' faces when they meet Reiji.
4Excuse me for CAC bullshit but that's too good of an idea not to do one for.Death-Boy Scissor Sin-NedDARK Fiend Level 4 1900/2000"Edge Imp Scissors" + 1 Spellcaster-Type monsterWhen this card is Fusion Summoned, you can send 1 card from your Deck to the Graveyard. Once per turn, you can banish 1 monster from your Graveyard with an attribute different than this card's; this card becomes that Attribute. When this card is removed from the field, target 1 monster in your Graveyard with the same attribute as this card had on the field; Special Summon that target.
8Yuya, cus he's the only one that will look good as a girl
4duelerGo home foreign kid
8Many other character had that name
6Goyo became an archetype before Blue-Eyes
1I'm just picturing Dennis' neck barely still attached to his head, slumped to the back while the Edge Imp has full control of his body.Guro artists need to get on the Human Des-Toy shit
9fucking red-eyes did it first how emberassing to be upstaged by a fucking joey monster.
6Dennis works with Sora tho
3Like seriously, Blue-Eyes has two supporting Tuners, and a Synchro and not one of those is a "Blue-Eyes" card.
Damnit why can't Revolution Force be as amazingly broken as it is in the animeLetting a monster use up all of its materials just doesn't fucking happen enough
6dw tho we got a super stupid new "boss"monster when that anubis movie came out. imo who doesn't want a boss that dies to man eater bug castel arc and any trap or spell that destroys? its fucking red-eyes darkness dragon but way worse somehow does konami hate us?
6Yeah, and if he ever had Human Des-Toys it would make sense for them to be based off of his Academia comrades. Dennis has Pendulums based on Yuri, Serena, and Sora. There could be Des-Boy Chain Ri-Joe and Des-Boy Saw O-Le
8might be a bit too morbid for a kids show anon
9I know that there's some strange lore lore behind most archetypes, but what the fuck are you talking about?
8Well the "human" Des-Toys are 1/3 of the way there. Just replace Elegy's head with Yuzu or one of her counterparts, then stick a bunch of weapon in her and make wings formed purely out of scissors of edginess.One for each of the four Ruris would be ZETSUBOU inducing. I don't think Yuya, Shun, or Yugo would attack a monster that looks like their Ruris.Wow... that sounds like an acid trip GX would have went on. Unless you count that one duel where the puppet doll girl used a Doll archetype which was LITERALLY Gimmick Puppets before Gimmick Puppets or Xyzs were ever thought of.
3Card games lore is deep
0Mr. Heartland was burned alive and he wasn't even the first person that happened to. He was also apparently eaten alive in the manga too.
8He doesn't even help his own team out of jail, they're jail breaking by themselves with Shinji and Crow
Looking back, who had it worse /a/?
7tfw Yuri likes Serena and Leo convinced him all the dimensions for her sake.
7Qli's can't reset the world now that Cosplayers run all over them all the time new cards when?
78DT mini-series when?
3One was an irrelevant one-off from the manga bumped to a regular, the other went from a regular to being forgotten about.
8I wish we got a ova spinoff based on it or something. That would be a better use of money then the new movie. Hell it might be more of a Gundam series product relation rather then the series product relation we have now. It could be pretty cool
7Dont forget that exciton is given the status of Zefra
3The first one wasn't even supposed to exist. She's only in one random chapter. Floating duel disk had it much worse. The writers just hated him, he was introduced ok and even beat SANDAA.
0Only hardcore lore nerds care about DT World and its never ending supply of world-shaking ancient evils. That's a lot less potential in profits than putting Yugi and Kaiba's faces on something.
I wanna know if I'm the only one who is thinking this.Is it possible that Yuri's Fusion Dragon will use Contact Fusion?
0its the fusion variant of a quick xyz or tunerless synchro its the only way to make them not -1I'm gonna go with yes
0I'd like a Ghostrick one-off sort of like the Sonic Unleashed CG movie.
7I'd like it if it had that style but not a simpleton story and the characters were actually good characters. Sonic Unleashed was a mess.
7Shaddols where born from Diamond's Caigorgon's body. Shadoll roots that was, once Diamond was dead, his body refused to die and began to fuse desperately with everything, thus creating the shaddolls.Nephilim is that new Gem Knight Fusion and stuff.
Z-ONE is the final boss of Arc-V. Prove me wrong. Pro tip  you can't. 
7My feet hurtthis party is so lameI bet none of these fags even have RanksI wish I was at home popping backrow
3Implying the final boss won't be Yugi
3you will never travel the world with the ghost of your alchemy professor, his cat, and your cardfuWhy live
Is this Xyz solitaire?
1Opponent uses FluffalsHas an Xyz on their fieldIts Acid Golem.That Academia member is clearly an impostor. An Academia member would not use such a shit Xyz like Acid Golem, but would use 1 Xyz monster which is actually good.Any Academia member caught using such shit Xyzs on their spying missions shall be carded on the spot after losing to Fusionist FTK.;
1final bosses are previous protags and they fight against the Yu's
1I need tips for my raidraptors deck
5Can't let the anti xyz meta be too strong

4b-bu then how am I gonna BRAVE CLAW REVOLUTION people?
4Why is Judai the most scenic protagonist? He's always popping up in the most beautiful places.
0Dedicated fanartists
7YAMERO is old hat
1say where do you discuss cards, decks and new card stuff?I have a problemo with Konami.They are obssesed with giving support to light decks, support that basically makes a deck that doesnt need support quite oppresive and autopilot. Or in this case shower certian with constant support that does not have anything to do with it, just for the sake of making it powerful. Lightsworn for example have been getting showers and showers of support since ever because the hax players are insistent on playing it.Meanwhile decks such as: Jurracs, Fish and other stuff just remain forgotten.Specially Jurracs, damn man they are so cool yet only like 3 cards are alright and the rest are mehh outdated or plain mediocre.
9It's not just that, I think the final episode of GX + BBT has made Judai strongly associated with solitary travel and gorgeous environments.
7My personal pet theory that might be completely wrong is that the arc-v multiverse is actually the yugioh universe from previous series that somehow got different time periods split into different dimensions by summoning method. Leo wants to bring the worlds back together because the REAL VILLAIN wants to use the split and weakened fabric of reality to destroy everything, but Fusion is not actually the right way to put the universe back together, Pendulum is after all they have to shill the cool new summon method
1Why isn't he enjoying the taste of MARVELOUS! there?
4Crow will replace Yuzu in the final romance scenes. Also, in the doujins.
409I hope Judai gets a movie next after Yugi and Kaiba's movie, It seems like the guy is having some amazing adventures after GX, I mean, Parkor in Venice Italy? Who expected that?
7say where do you discuss cards, decks and new card stuff?/dng/ at /vg/ if you can wade through the threadly shitposting
7Fuck that. At least you guys have a deck.When the HELL am I going to get Burning Skull Head support? I am SO FUCKING SICK of piggybacking off of the standard Zombie engine.
2I think he doesn't exist in the alternate universe but he along with all other previous MCs will appear by the end once the dimension fusing shenanigans start.
1This guy might have gotten more significance and development.
7You could have Yugi and Kaiba go into the DT world. Win-Win.Also,Not liking neverending supplies of ancient evils.
6I would rather piggy back on a deck that works than having a deck that just cant fucking work at all.
2Burning Skeleton BodyLevel 3 FIRE Zombie 1000/1000If you control no cards, you can Special Summon this card from your hand. When Special Summoned this way, you can inflict 1000 damage to your opponent for each "Burning Skull Head" in your Graveyard. When this card is in the Graveyard, you can banish it; add 1 FIRE Zombie-Type monster from your Deck to your hand.Boom. The deck works now. That easy.
1Implying the final boss won't be The Barian Light of Destruction playing shadow games on motorcycles
1No I think Fusion is the true way to unite dimensions. It has been that in GX too and Leo is from standard so he chose Fusion on purpose.Also after being the villains for the whole series I think they are getting redeemed in the end.I do however think that pendulum will be something that ruins Leo's plan. It's probably the fifth dimension he didn't account for and why his dimension fusion device won't work because he's missing the fifth Ruri.But I do agree that Arc-V is somehow connected to the original timeline. DM, GX and 5D's are direct sequels, ZeXal is an outlier but Arc-V perfectly explains why that is the case and Arc-V also brings back 5Ds characters so clearly Arc-V wants to connect to the original timeline again. I'm suspicious about 5Ds characters returning. Maybe Yliaster really is behind tje dimensional split. After all they also use the energy based duel discs everyone in Arc-V is using.
7So you want a deck based on a single card?
7Burial into 3 searches?I like it. Doesn't change that CAC is cancer but I see your point.
2Skull Flame and Supersonic Skull Flame exist too.4 themed cards including the one that anon made, and a lot of generic Zombie support. It could work.I'd be down to proxy Skeleton sometime.
3So this?
7It can search Goka, so that's neat.If that thing was a tuner it could open up some fun Synchro plays
1No, that's just edgy Master Hand.
2well then a ghost rider themed deck then?I think you've got as much cards as vector and a bunch of other anime archtypes that never got farther than 3 to 4 cards.
7tfw glads will never be relevant again
2There's definitely a group of people that split the dimensions to save it from some bigger evil. Might even be the previous protagonists working together in some BBT level event. The big evil is obviously the god of destruction which is a combination of all extra deck monsters. So they split it into four dragons to strip it of its power. And their souls all reincarnated in some little boys. Yuya is slowly recreating the original dragon by combining his various dragons.
0They're still cool and after playing some DN duels with Skeleton as a proxy, the deck is solid.
7YOU MUST BUY NEKROZYOU MUST WIN WITH NEKROZNEKROZ IS LOVE, NEKROZ IS LIFE
2Maybe Yliaster really is behind tje dimensional split.COULD IT BE?
3Od I hate Nekroz so much. I know all Tier 0 decks are hated but I actually miss Qliphorths. With Qliphorths they have one super overpowered boss monster and you have to deal with it. That's cool. Bit with shot like Nekroz every single fucking card in the deck is an overpowered boss monster. It's just bullshit
WHY PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT NEKROZ WHEN QLISHIT ARE BROKEN AS FUCK HOLY SHIT BAN THOSE FUCKING MACHINES WHO THOUGH IT WAS A GOOD IDEA I HOPE ALL THOSE PEOPLE GET FIRED AND ALL THE FUCKING CARDS GET BANNED AND EVERYONE WHO PLAY THAT BROKEN ASS DECK OF SHIT DIE A PAINFUL DEATH
8I really don't get why people don't run one Towers.You're only running one, so it's unlikely to brick, it's searchable, so you can always have it when you need it, and it serves as a way to get over problematic monsters.Plus, it's easily sided out against decks that don't give a shit about it.
8QLIPHORT ARE SHITNEKROZ JUST CANCEL THEIR SPECIAL OR NEGATE THEIR SPELL AND SHIT'S DONE.QLISHIT ON THE OTHER HAND I SUMMON A MONSERTHEN LOL RANDOM QLI WITH SAQLISHIT PLUS CHALICE I OWN YOU YOU CANT DESTROY IT THEN I JUST WAIT UNTIL NEXT TURN KEEP SUMMON I DONT NEED A TOWER TO KICK YO ASS GG NO RE GOODD BYE FUCK TYHATSHIOT
Support fucking when? I am dying for Goyo Guardian/Assault Mode and Star Eater/Assault Mode
8With Qliphorths they have one super overpowered boss monster and you have to deal with itQliphorts ran every cancer stun floodate they could and beat you down with a hoarde of monsters they summon off Shell, it's an awful linear piece of shit. At least Nekroz are open enough that its possible for someone to fuck up playing them
3It's fun to imagine, but I doubt the nostalgia is strong enough with Judai for his name to carry a movie like Yugi and Kaiba can.
9This is what bad players actually believe
5Post yfw Shooting Quasar Dragon/Assault Mode OVA
8I don't mind it when people run the boss variant, but when they run the backrow version where my only counter play is hoping to top deck multiple MTSs then I get pissed. They can't even be punished for bad plays with that many floodgates.
7THIS IS WHAT SHITTY QLIWHORES ACTUALLY BELIEVES FUCK THE CRAP OFF FAGGOT
3Stop spamming all caps faggot
3THE DAY QLI ARE BANNED I WILL DO IT FUCKING FAGGOT MAGGOT LEAVE THE FUCK OUT I AM FUCKING ANGRY RIGHT NOW
9Reminder that Qlis in their prime die to T.G. Agents.
Why is Yuya such a fucking cutie, holy shit
3I'm building the deck in real life and there's nothing you can do to stop meI already have a MonolithSuck it faggot
4He is super manly you faggot.Reunion fucking when?
When was the last time a full duel was finished?
1
5They'll reunite on Yugo's deathbed.
4YuyaThat's a funny way to spell Sora
4SANDAAA' orchestrates a birthday party and invites everyone to the absurdly huge Manjoume MansionFirst 10-15 minutes are spent showing Judai traveling by land, sea, and air to get there on time plus character interactions and gratuitous shots of Judai stuffing his face at the buffet table on Ebi Fry that Manjoume had specifically cooked for him Then he announces a Duel Tournament and we get highlights of everyone's decks for 10 minutesManjoume v. Judai in the Finals for the last 30-45 minutes
3Bennis vs Gon
4Manjoume beats Fubuki in the semis to finally win the AsukabowlNew ojama support
still no HANASE parodies starring SerenaJapan I am disappoint.
8Who? Now back to the topic, Yuya is a cutie
4Best girl
9Could HANASE grow to the levels of dank Yugioh memes such as BOOKS? Its cute, but is it memeful enough?
8What is with this blank webm?
3HA☆NA☆SE was already done in DM and is pretty old
I want to see Shingo and Manjoume hang out
4Yuya somewhat acts motherly towards young children instead of fatherly, this is probably because Yuya was brought up with his mother more and little time with his father. Also when he hugged Yuzu I guarantee if he was brought with his father more then he would've pushed her away out of embarrassment because 'shes a girl' and girls are icky attitude boys have.
5No one dimension can contain that much ego
3Sounds like Yusei has developed stockholm syndrome because there is no way he would go out with a woman unless he was forced to.
0I want their reunion hug to be x10 better than this one, also this time both of them engage on it
So I want to get back into Yu-Gi-Oh and watch everything again In other words throw away all my freetime.I got told that I should read the Duell Monsters Manga but what about the other Series? Can I just watch the Anime versions from GX onwards?
0Yuya is Yuzu's mother figure
5After DM, all the other Yugioh manga series are different stories from their anime counterparts. Like how the GX anime involves dimension crossing and aliens, while the manga pretty much stays on the island and is a bit more down to earth even if both share characters of the same names and designs.
9I'm curious to see how much tsun will be left after this ordeal0Tfw fetish for both motherly people and cute boys like Yuya
0Yuya was raised up by a gentle and caring mother, that's why he shows a huge amount of care to YuzuYuzu was raised up by a manly father, however she still has her normal 'female' caring instinct towards Yuya, despite getting the crude/strong personality from his father.
0Seriously they better have a child after the timeskip
29It's going to be on Yuma/Astral levels.
9TimeskipsIn Yu-gi-ohThat never happens you know.
2Well 5D's had one, and Arc-V is clearly becoming 5D's 2.0 but better
2We did get a few timeskip scene in 5Ds
7Well 5D's had oneWhere everyone was a lonely single Christmas Cake except for those damn incestuous twins that can't keep their hands off each other.
4That bit where Rukas slut friends are getting wet over Rua and she tries to deflect themThe thirst was real
4Implying Yuya's and Yuzu's relationship is not strong enough for them to be together forever
4Where everyone was a lonely single Christmas Cake except for those damn incestuous twins that can't keep their hands off each other.So what you're saying is in the Arc-V epilogue Shun will have shacked up with Ruri and everyone else will be forever alone?
4Yes.Will Shun ever have a waifu? Something like Carly.
2I still think Shun will end up with Serena because Yuri is EEEVVVVIIILLLLLL
8That was in the beginning of 154 and it was like 2 minute glimps into everyone's future.
9Shun will end up with SerenaSorry, but Selena only has eyes for Yuzu
2Shun has imouto, he doesn't need a waifu. Gon deserves to have a foreign cutie like Olga to practice his tuning with.
4Shun and Ruri end is pretty much confirmed.
3Serena only has eyes for YuzuSorry, but Yuzu only has eyes for Yuya
5I just love them together but I want Mieru to be happy.Harem route maybe?
23Nonsense.
9Gon deserves to have a foreign cutie like Olga to practice his tuning withEhh, n.. no Gongenzaka-senpai, your levels are far too big, there's no way they'll fit in my little tuner
5Go to bed, Reiji.
Speaking of Reiji, does he really have footage of Serena out there?
7They can end with a threesome.Or a foursome if Yuto doesn't separate from Yuya.Or a fivesome if Yugo gets eaten.We'd end up with one dried tomato if that happened though.
Zuzu Boyle
I want Yuya and Yuzu's reunion to be a declaration of love or something. Heck, I'd even settle with the camera looking away from them while a big kisu sound plays and Gongenzaka looks proud/Shun looks angry/Selena looks jealous.
7They'll see each other, eye fuck for a few moments, then Yuya will say something baka and Yuzu will get out the fan
7Selena looks jealous.Of which one?
Might as well ask here.After watching all released episodes of ARC-V, which spin-off should I see? Are 5D's and ZEXAL good?
15Ds is greatZexal is nonredeemable garbage that gets kind of ok at the end if you like the Barians
5Ds was good until Yoshida sank his women hating fangs into the show. Then it's average.Zexal varries from good to HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA GONNA BRING IT TO THEM
1First 64 episodes of 5Ds are great. Rest is watchable, gets a bit better near the end but still never gets as good as Fortune Cup + Dark Signers. Also still mad about the "twist" near the end..
15Ds is very good. for the first 64? or so episodes then becomes very different. Still has it's moments from time to time after its prime.Zexal is generally regarded as shit for the entire first season. The protag is just too retarded. Funnest villains appear once season two starts.
9760As expected 5D's is more liked than ZEXAL so I'm gonna watch that first and then give ZEXAL a try.And what about GX? I saw the 4kids translation from the beginning to the half of sartorius arc a while back because of reasons, is the rest of the anime decent?
8GX is watched for two reasonsHow fucking weird it gets, and how fucked everything gets in season 3
8GX has the biggest sliding scale.The first 2 seasons are mostly episodic but if you want to see Koyasu play a fortune teller that screams THE WORLD then at least watch that.And then Season 3 happens and they jump the rails into insanity
Name your favourite monster.That monster fall in love with you, fuck and had a child, name your half-breed child and effects.If sex is not possible then you Xros with it and becomes a new type of monster, name it and effects.You can try both only if you got at least top 16 in any important tournament. Otherwise don't even think about it.
8Personally I love GX, but I'm biased for heroes/villain of the week shenanigans.GX is a fun silly time for the first half, like really weird, in a good way, DINO DNA, then shit gets crazy once the Supreme King makes his appearance.
7Stardust DragonWere-StardustLv 62000/2500If you control a "Stardust" monster, you can Normal summon this card without tributing. If this card is Normal Summoned, change it to Defense Position. "Stardust" monsters other than "Were-Stardust" are unaffected by your opponent's card effect. If this card would be destroyed, you can return a Tuner monster from your hand or graveyard to your deck instead.
7How do you expect me to fuck a giant chicken flower dragon.
9I am this guy 6 and I say Stardust Dragon is my waifu so obviously if I did it you can do it too. Or you can just make a fusion like that anon sayed.
6Protects your monsters from all card effectsAnd can't be destroyedI know it's a normal summon but still that's broke as shit
3fucking a dragonDISGUSTING
1From S3 onwards it gets much better. And weirder.
3Nigga she's almost literally 100% thorns and vines.
9YuseixStardust is a thing ya know?2Polymerization then
7Sorry dude me and Gottoms are bros but we ain't like that
6This is just bizarre but that effect needs some nerf.9Well, try using the Xros thing, like Digimon Xros Wars.2Same as above.
27Fusion scum
7uhhh what do?
7XrosIt's called gattai anon.And I just leave this here, because I don't have the imagination for this at the moment.And please avoid putting the inferior loli that is Pirika.
9228Basically I wanted to say Gattai like 7 this guy sayed.
7And please avoid putting the inferior loli that is Pirika.yeah, no
I miss Nakajima
6YOU MISS ME?! WELL I AM HERE AND NOW I SHALL TELL YOU THE GLORY OF LDS AND WHY REIJI IS THE BEST THING THAT STANDARD HAVE.
6Reiji pls
6Go back to bed, Reijifield.
7mfw she has 1 leg and 1 stumpreprint/fixed art when?
6I always felt like Nakajima was going to try to overthrow Reiji or the whole Akaba family in generalSome of the dialogue between him and Reiji just conveyed that this guy was going to be a villain
You will never be whisked away by a Ninja onto a magical adventure in a parallel world after spending 3 days with a bunch of peasants, and 3 retards your nii-sama wants as canon fodder
6Without Nakajima, who's going to always be at Reiji's side to gobut, WHY?when he's talking about his keikaku?I'm starting to feel like Reiji really did split up everyone on purpose. Maybe he figured they'd all cause enough racket on their own to draw Jean-Michel's attention while he does whatever he's doing.
7Fine, then. XXW-Saber Lunar GottomsDARK Fusion Level 11 2200/4100"XX-Saber Gottoms" + 1 Fusion monsterMust first be Fusion Summoned with the above Fusion Materials. Once per turn, you can discard 1 random card from your opponent's hand to draw 1 card and reveal it. If both the discarded monster and the card were monsters, halve your opponent's LP. You can only use this effect of "XXW-Saber Lunar Gottoms" once per turn.
2*If both the discarded card and the card drawn were monsters, halve your opponent's LP.Fuck I'm high.
7These threads have really gone downhill.
4The sad part is that people are actually doing them and the post doesn't have 0 replies
7Elemental Hero Stratos...?The baby will grow up with her papa in jail, but I guess it could work.Elemental Hero Galegirllv 4 Warrior/Wind1300/1000When this card is summoned, add one HERO card from your graveyard to your hand.If this card is on the field, you can shuffle it into the deck; return any number of banished HERO monsters to the graveyard, then special summon any number of HERO fusion monsters from your extra deck by using the shuffled monsters as material.
4Relative to when? Because it's gone the way of most generals on /a/ for the long past while.
3its a boring week cause of a filler episode and no real releases of cards to speak of. It's to be expected if we keep the non stop threats but we have less content.
7Already always, and obviously a child.Magician Child31000/200You can special summon this monster from your hand if you control a Dark Magician Girl. If a Dark Magician Girl in your side of the field leaves the field, you can target that monster, banish a card from your hand, and if you do, special summon both this card and that monster. You can only use 1 of these effects to special summon Magician Child. You can tribute this face up card, all monsters in both players graveyards are treated as Dark Magician or Magician of Black Chaos your choice.
5I'd run it. At one.
What are the odds of Fortress of Prophecy being in the new set untouched? seems like a good staller til you get secret village of the spellcasters out or the magician's valkyrias and miracle flipper out. Then again, for all I know even like that it's shit, I can't into meta.
Whole month of prison We crash town now
20It's good but why more attack than defense?9I actually like the last effect.5Should it be using the banished monsters?
2Crashtown was A TWO fucking monthsB In the middle of a sea of pointless fucking fillerC Had nothing to do with the plot and didn't meaningfully affect anything whatsoeverD Was about a character nobody gave two fucks about.
4It's supposed to be based on yourself right?I'm a fucking pussy who would have no more than 2500 ATK in my best form but I have pretty good agility and I can resist pain pretty well.
We're nearly at the 20 episode mark when Yuya and Yuzu were last seen on-screen together, this by far beats the record where the MC and main girl are seperated from each other in yugioh
4Well that's a good reasoning.5It will not be something important if it wasn't by the fact their relationship is really important and with a lot of potential.
6A TWO fucking monthsB In the middle of a sea of pointless fucking fillerC Had nothing to do with the plot and didn't meaningfully affect anything whatsoeverD Was about a character nobody gave two fucks about.Some people are just never satisfied.
Its one for thing for the idiots to argue over the most trivial shot, but I just lost it when the goofy music started playing. Did they change the writers?
1Would you satisfy a Kiryu?
CAC shit2I'm not Yusei, so unlikely
6Am I the only one in this thread who liked Crashtown? Infernity Death Gunman was fucking cool and while an asspull, Infernity Zero was fucking cool too.The disk revolvers were badass and we also got 1 turn 3 kill. The whole thing was pretty hype other than not having to do with fucking anything.
2Things should pick up at the start of the Friendship Cup tournament.Right now, it pretty much seems like Arc-V is running in parallel with 5D's Fortune Cup Arc.To quote Neo fro NAC:The heroes are in the slum parts of the cityThey end up fighting security and escapeThey end up in a Duel that gets halted, resulting in their arrest and prison timeThey duel people in prisonThey end up Dueling Security as they get out of prisonAll the while a major tournament looms in the backgroundAnd the head of the police has some nefarious scheme he's planning.Maybe next time we'll see Yuzu again, she's in the tournament having Psychic Powers?
7The start and end was hype. Most of it was stupid railcar chases and nonsensical drama with the kids
7Some of the dueling was cool, but Crashtown embodies so much that I hate about part 2, so I dump on it a lot.
I JUST noticed that Death Dragon's hair is actually its skull, opened to reveal his brain.I guess this is okay but fucking scissors aren't.
1What's wrong with scissors?
1SKULL ITS PART OF THE BODY HUMANSCISSOR CAN BE A DEADLY WEAPONALSO I HAVE A CARD THAT IS THE BEST BUT IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD AND YOU CANT HAVE ITAND ULTRA BLOOM DIVA AND GHOST OGRE SECRET
4Kevin Tewart, pls go.
I find it funny how in 5D's Yusei had to deal with 4-5 episodes in prison where based on the month summaries Arc-V will deal with at least 4 episodes in prison.
2I don't know. Ask Konami.
6How did you know I was acting like him?
7How do we censor these cards, 4kids-kun?Just make them glow
7Saws are bad too. But apparently strangling a sheep with chains is A OK.
7Third line gave it away.
tfw no focus on these two for a while
What if the replacement protagonists of each dimensions aren't the Yuyas but the Yuzus? And the Yuyas are actually the heroines of each dimension?
0Thing is that Sheep is an obvious metaphor for animal cruelty in food processing. Like, cmon. The mechanism strapped to its back that was obviously made to pull something through before it was attached to it, like a conveyor belt in a slaughterhouse. Also, it has metal limbs, probably signifying that it can't move on its own. Next, its card background. The other Des-Toy monsters have a stitched up background, but not Sheep. Sheep's background is obviously very ghostly, which I think shows that it probably isn't on our plane of existence. This would also explain why it hovers. It's a ghost. Lastly, its attack. Red. Like blood. Yu-Gi-Oh: Now with graphic slaughterhouse metaphors!
6Okay seriously what the fuckWhy does this make so much sense
5Its kinda lame though. Fortune Cap arc had pretty hype Yusei vs Jack early on to grab viewer attentions and introduce the series mythology. So far Synchro arc its just Lancers screwing up.
5I liked Fortune Cup, but that just makes it look like the director is jamming in a rehash of it with Arc-V, regardless of how it meshes, just because it's his pet favorite.And this time it doesn't have the Yusei/Jack rivalry and their novelty as new characters in a new series to spur it on, since Yuya and Reiji are already on the same team on paper and have had themselves established in the first 50 episodes while the show was still in Maiami. The rest of the Lancers were either there from the beginning or from the Battle Royale.Yugo could be the 'rival' for Synchro arc, but ultimately he's also a good guy who would share the same sentiment that Academia needs to be stopped.That said, I'm not buttmad over the first few Synchro episodes or anything, I find it amusing seeing everyone fuck up their first mission together. A good number of them haven't ever handled a job that goes beyond their personal goals until now, and members acting selfishly seems like a natural outcome. The Lancers messed up, dueled over trivial matters, and then the consequence was being arrested for fucking around. I just hope that there's some payoff to this in everyone actually learning to work together competently and developing a bit, instead of focusing on paralleling 5D's for the sake of it.
1srry i am not seeing it.i have never seen a skull shaped like a nest, and with a tail too..and you can clearly see all his bones are pure silver. not lite green.
5How are you surviving? So many people are bitching about how crappy the episodes are going to be based on two-sentence summaries.
7
So while in Standard we got a lot of Fusion and got invaded, now were in Synchro seeing how everything is divided, so were going to Xyz land next
1I'm actually barely surviving. I try to draw Serenas just to try to wear the boredomness off.But shouldn't there be another long summary for these episodes too?
3I was surprised about that too.Usually there're extended summaries as well as the small previews. But I guess not this time.
8oo, still looks weird as hell.
Why didn't Serena just start shooting her CARDING laser?It was shown that the Fusion users could easily card people who weren't dueling.Which is a fate those fucking security guards deserve for not challenging them to a duel before arresting them.
4aReiji fucked up Serena's disk duelbShe nows think that carding people is badcShe is retarded, like everyone else right now
4This will always be canon to me
4I think the laws work so that the officers can arrest anyone they want on the spot as long as they beat them in a duel, and if that fails or they really need to arrest someone quickly, they use force. So in other words, it's a corrupt ass system. As for the carding laser, I think if it detects a disk, it has to defeat it before it can card. No disk = instant ded
1speaking of...
0But Academia were carding civilians back in Heartland too.
6Johan got his ass dumped for cardfu, and Yubel doesn't share.
All I want to see is Reiji being completely SCARED, shaking in fear as he realises that whoever the real bad is, it's too much for them.
8Actually, here's the long summary.
3Hirota for the following next two episodes, then Tamura, and lastly Kamishiro for Episode 63.
3Any anons who know moonrunes see anything notable not already known?
5Last summary says that Yuma appears and saves the world.
3Hirota for the following next two episodes
7Slacker MagicianUnachieverlvl 5Spellcaster/Normal/Pendulum1000/1000Scale: 1P eff: The turn you activate this card you can perform an additional normal summon. M text: "Easy come, easy go"
5Seems like Kamishiro is into sucking Gon and Shun's Ds for episode 63. The two of them are going to help Yuya fight back so the Lancers can escape. All three make a "beautiful" play together.Unfortunately what awaits them after their escape is Jean-Michel Roger?.Expect more Raidraptors soon!
5inb4 Gon sacrifices his hand or lets his LP hit 0 so Shun and/or Yuya can grab the win
5I was expecting Reiji to swoop in but this is nice too. Anything new on 61? It looks to have a decent amount of new info.
Why did Dennis and Shun go back to their normal clothes? Wait, don't arrest me, let me change first.
2They managed to wear them under their riding suits.Yes, even Shun and his coat.
9That doesn't sound comfortable.
3Nah. It's pretty much the same. Yuya duels Tokumatsu, and the summary kinda explains how he duels.
5Yuzu is totally the co protagonist they saidYuzu is part of the power trio they said Neo New Sawatari's new deck will be good they saidSerena will totally do stuff they said Yeah, no, it doesn't matter if there's a Yoshida or not, Girls do not belong on the front lines in shows like YGO period, you want that, you need to take your ass to a magical girl show.
9Sigh, just because the plot doesn't call for Yuzu right now doesn't mean that she isn't a relevant main character who will get broken cards as time goes along. By that same logic you can say Yugo is just as irrelevant as her. There is no reason for them to throw Yuzu to the side when her and Yuya's relationship is the structure of the fucking plot.They're also waiting to shill Serena's cards until she has a meaningful duel, which she hasn't yet really, aside from introducing Cat Dancer. Also,Sawatari a girl
9More like so begins another string of people saying Yuzu isn't relevant anymore until she does something that makes people cream themselves over her again.
4The ruri's are not main characters, faggot.
1It's a magical coat.
4must be gathered for REALLY BAD/MISUNDERSTOOD GOOD THING to happenall of them duelone's relationship is very central to the plotSure, not main characters at all.
0But she hasn't appeared for a few episodes anon, that mean's she's automatically irrelevant.
4Technically, my only beef with these batch of episodes is Serena and Sawatari still not having any full on-screen duel. I'm fine with Yuzu being off-screen for a while considering that the Lancers are that big, but shilling Shun and Gon's cards again after a month of doing it? Definitely not.
Which Ruri would you?
0They aren't characters, their fucking plot devices. All of them have the same personality just different extremes of it AND they all have a stupid boy who goes even more stupid when they aren't around to sipon off those extra stupid points. That reeks of mary sues.
4My curiosity is making me wonder if Yuzu when she returns to the plot is going to have an Aki tier entrance by shilling brand new cards including the Fantasia/Melodious Synchros to the inevitable Friendship Cup Arc or will she get a Ruka tier one where she gets bad cards and a subpar return.
4Probably closer to the former.
3Ruri.
4I hope she gets new cards. Melodious are strong, too bad she doesn't know how to use them well yet.
3YUZU!!
Fucking /u/ cancer and waifufags have ruined Hibiki Sound and GG and BB for me, Don't you carpet munchers ruin this show for me,too,goddamit
88If we are repeating the 5D's first season plotline for ARC-V, we will get after the prison arc rumors of a powerful duelist that apparently uses both fusion and synchro who wears a cloak to cover her identity and the Lancers try to confront her and she vanishes before they find her. Later she enters the cup with Yugo with the intention of meeting THE KINGU to try to warn him and by extension the City of the impending invasion of Academia where eventually she ends up dueling the tomato and pushes him into a corner and inevitably powers him up by allowing him to gain the ability to Pendulum synchro. That's probably how her identity is revealed.
1Yuzu was relevant far before we even knew Leo was a character.Opinion = BTFO
7Ah, well, imagine this scenario.Let's play Yu-Gi-Oh!Okay! You be Sora! I'll be Yuya!I ATTACK WITH EDGE IMP SABRES!Today on the six o'clock news: A child died today playing Yu-Gi-Oh with his friend. The parents are suing Konami Digital Entertainment. When asked if they thought they had a good case against the video game company, the parent's lawyer was quoted as saying "WHOOPEE!" and throwing a wad of hundred dollar bills in the air.
8But why would Yuzu do anything but immediately reveal herself to Yuya or really anyone she recognizes?
1Arc-V has been full of waifufags since early episodes. You might as well leave /arc-v/ and just watch the show by yourself if you don't like those people.
8Will she have Psychic Powers, wears a mask and tentacle the tomato?
0She is currently a fugitive from the law and forced into hiding if she is not busy trying to convince the City that Academia is going to invade. Eventually she realizes that it's not going to work unless you possess the power to make them convinced.
6That still doesn't answer why she wouldn't immediately try to communicate with Yuya or Gon or Selena if she happened to see them.
3Probably so, she'll even gain a bust up as well to complete the makeover thanks to Synchro Air/water. After all she does have the flower theme of the Ruris.1First off she doesn't know that they are there in the City and when she does she'll try to contact them but who knows where the Lancers are going to stay after the Prison arc.
3From NAC:Episode 61: The Man Who Threw Away His DrawsWhile the people of the detention facility watch on, Yuuya and Tokumatsu Chojiro began their intense Duel. Using the “Tokumatsu Lethal Combo” that allows him to draw and cut away Life Points, Tokumatsu drives Yuuya into a corner, and was fully convinced that he has won. However, Yuuya continues to press on without giving up, believing that a miracle will happen. Seeing this, Chojiro begins to undergo a change of heart…?Like I said, pretty much the same. Not much interesting things going on.
7Believing a miracle will happentfw egao mode engages and yuya uses new jankIt's a big fucking stretch but one can dream right ;_;
And the rest from NAC:Episode 62: The Great Entertainment Duel TournamentThe revival of “Enjoy Chojiro” has brought much excitement to the detention facility. Since the Duel between Yuuya and Tokumatsu, the inmates have become more lively. Meanwhile, Shinji suggests that Yuuya should participate in the “Entertainment Duel Tournament.” In reality, it was an escape plan, devised by Crow and Shinji.Episode 63: The King of Captors - Goyo KingYuuya and co. was heading outside the detention facility. A pursuit squad chased after them and summoned their Goyo Monsters, quickly cornering them. However, Gongenzaka and Kurosaki then showed up to aid them! Using their team play, they were able to break through. They all thought that they have successfully escaped. However, the Director of the Public Security Maintenance Bureau, Roger, stood in their way.
3I would hanate Serena's monsta
2However, the Director of the Public Security Maintenance Bureau, Roger, stood in their wayI sense invitation to the friendship cup time!
2hanatenot HANASE
9The only thing Jean-Michel needs now is a tiny clown to truly be Godwin: chess edition
2So what do you guys think Goyo King's effect is gonna be?I'm betting on something like you can summon a Goyo monster from your extra deck if it destroys a monster
2In reality, it was an escape plan, devised by Crow and Shinji.So it's probably not an actual tournament. Thank god, that would have been unnecessary with the Frienship Cup coming up.
2At this rate chess-kun is going to be leading the Lancers around more than Reiji ever did
9Reiji led them once and look what happened. He can't possibly do a worse job.
9So Roger will get the Lancers into the group and Yugo/Yuzu are probably already qualified Yuzu by proxy because Rin is probably qualified already.
So are Shun and Gongenzaka becoming bros? They teamed up to take down Obelisk Force and now they're working together against GOYO KINGU too.
0Probably. Steeled strength and whatnot.
0Mfw they become closer bros than Gon/Yuya
9So your trying to say Gon will bear hug Shun now?
0Nah, Shun is too autistic to have friends. Yuto was his best friend and he didn't give a shit about him.
2Are they even friends? Shun wanted to beat the crap out of him when Yuto stopped him from dueling Masumi.
New thread:7
Who will Hibiki fist first in GX?

Does NGE have the most satisfying OP of all time?The way the music and visuals synch is perfect.
I found the theme to be really annoying, like they forced their little chorus. The visuals were ok I guess
1Probably not, but that syncing was nice as fuck.
1that shit hypes me up so muchit's one of the main reasons i love rewatching NGE
1It's a pretty great OP.
1No.
1Yes.
1Maybe.
1It is amongst the very best openings, yes. It is upbeat as well, even though the anime may not exactly be upbeat. Depending on your perspective.
1Shit forgot the TV series from the 70s that used the same editing techniques.
1The syncThe upbeatAn element which really makes it for me is the chorus
1Maybe. I'm trying to think of similar OPs but I can't right now.
1No.
pitchy ching wordsok tunecopy pasted imaginaryreused scenesDoes NGE have the most satisfying OP of all time?Absolutely not.
Considering what an important character and best girl Asuka turned out to be it's kind of stunning she's seen only twice, and one was just as a silhouette.
you remember the words, /a/?
1I like comic stylized Jazz instrumental OPs. Gunsmith cats, Read or Die, Baccano, Mitchko e Hatchin, Cowboy Bebop, that stuff.
I like the ED more.me feel like nothing in the show really mattered.
4I thought the same regarding the OP for the longest time. Cue a Reifag or three making a snarky comment, though.I suppose they could use it, being as on suicide watch as they are. In any case, one would assume Asuka would have been more prominent in the OP, being one of the three main pilots.
1never forget
3
1I like A Cruel Angel's Thesis more than I do NGE itself.
4One of those times she's topless, that counts for like three times.
I feel like the Katanagatari re-air OP was just incredibly 'right'. The song suited it to an absolute T. The only real problem is the amount of spoilers in there.
Reifag here,And yeah, the OP is pretty kickass
5I believe that's Misato unless you're talking about the silhouette at the beginning of the OP.
1I'd never looked that closely and you're right, it's Misato.
NEGAMI NANTE NARENA IMA WA WATASHI WA IKIRU
4She was written in as a plan B when Anno realized that he was incapable of writing Rei's character to her full potential, it's not like she mattered that much to the series itself.
3it's not like she mattered that much to the series itself.I know, Anno even said Rei's character arc should have been done by episode six.
Also 
4That makes me happy. All red versus blue shit aside, Asuka is infinitely more fuckable than Rei.
7I could chastise you for the snarky comment but instead I shall look upon you quizzically for taking anything Anno says seriously.
1Every time you lewdpost a normalfag enters 4chan for the first time. It may be you4As opposed to some biased anon on the internet right? You should take both with a grain of salt.

8Biased anon might be earnestly trying to spoonfeed and believe what he's saying, though. Anno is always trolling because he doesn't think anybody should be asking him what the fuck they just watched.
I always thought this sequence was well done.
1He took the concept of forcing a pair together that really didn't belong and made a meta statement about it. Youhave to hand it to him, he is a clever man.
6I think there's an old adage somewhere around about good intentions.

There are huge rumors floating around Sunrise is unleashing the Kraken with a four anime series that are sequels coming this fall through next year. First is Cross Ange second season,Zegapain sequel,Mai-HiME continuation and Gundam Wing:Frozen Teardrop. How does /a/ feel about Sunrise being BASED
4Implying two of them won't be Accel and Horizon
4Provide sauce or GTFO.
4Well three of those are garbage so who cares.
1Soon
3Well Mai-Hime isn't one of those garbages thankfully
0Accel no, but Horizon is a possibility unless they could do full 52 episode cour for 3rd season.
6Hardly. Horizon is a relatively high budget anime.
yfw it is S-cry-ed out of nowhere
4Sunrise hasn't announced any new TV series for this year yet. They're kind of due, but this is the first I've heard of any of this. As far as I know they have the Love Live movie, Code Geass Akito The Exiled Parts 3 and 4, Gundam The Origin Part 2 and that Mirai Arise project for 2016 and that's pretty much it.
4Code Geass R3 soon.
4How much money can one possibly make? Isn't Sunrise literally bathing in money at this point.
8They have Love Live, right?Not to mention all the mecha anime and trainwrecks.I am cheering them on, I heartily laugh with them every season.
9Were they still talks for new Mai-series in the future unless Studio 8 is doomed for more LoveLive for an eternity.
not Code GeassDoes Sunrise not want more money? CG would make more money than all of those except maybe Gundam.Unless they're waiting till next year for the 10th anniversary.
2They have Love Live, right?Yeah and it's not dying anytime soon considering that they have a movie coming out very soon plus the new Sunshine cast.
0I can't imagine something not being announced with the last Akito episode
4Gundam Wing:Frozen TeardropWhy would Sunrise make a sequel to a 20+ year old, mediocre Gundam show that flopped in Japan?Sounds like the rumor mill you're getting this from is full of shit.
no evidence whatsoeverWhy should I take this seriously and assume that OP is not a faggot?
5Said sequel already exists
9Code Geass Akito The Exiled Parts 3 and 4They're doing another one in the fall and that Mirai Arise project for 2016That's Bandai Namco Entertainment
5Much as I hate Wing, it was not a flop.There's a lot of speculation it might happen, but there's also a lot of speculation it might not largely because it barely features the all important plastic crack; but also the plot for Frozen Teardrop is fucking ridiculous.
4Zegapain sequelYeah, that's never happening
7weren't they supposed to work with a new Mai-HiME series this year or another studio takes hold on new Mai-project3it's all speculah anon
5They wont do it since its like 20 chapters in and they still haven't shown any of the Gundams
7Sunshine is going to be an abortion,I can feel it happening
0Said sequel already exists2but also the plot for Frozen Teardrop is fucking ridiculous.Oh my god, it's a real thing. I feel like my life was better in ignorance of such awful nonsense.
5I don't know if it's going to be an abortion but I certainly don't want the original cast to leave. And I think most people feel the same, it's not going to be easy for Sunshine.
5WINGflopped in JapanStop embarassing yourself.
4Mai-HiME continuationYukarin will find huge motivation to not kill herself and will voice her favorite character
Every single one of those series are absolute shit
You imbeciles aren't different to KyoAnus.
6And then end up voicing one of her characters who lost again, which probably won't help.
9well one of'em are going to be the flagstaff IP's for Sunrise in the long run. LoveLive is one of them with Gundam too. Mai-franchise is about to make a huge comeback soon and Cross Ange is the Votoms of this generation.
5And here we go with the just saying shit again. Yes that horrible horrible flop of a Gundam show. Jesus Christ.....
7At least she got a kiss
Cross ange 2OH yes my body is ready
Zegapain sequelAs much as I loved Zegapain, what is a sequel going to cover? I didn't see much room left after that ending.
4They're still shit
5Bandai Namco Pictures but ultimately same company really, just under a different brand name. Hence the copyright BNP/Sunrise at the end of the trailer.
7Any time people make up their minds during the early promotional phase of something they know very little about it's not going to be an easy time. I remember people saying roughly the same shit for Love Live when it was announced arguing that it'll never come close to matching iDOLM@STERs popularity and was doomed and we all saw how that went. I expect some sort of poorly thought out absolutist "yes but..." reply here in any case. No really guys it's totally different this time and sucks because it sucks. I wonder what their group name will be.
6What's the deal with this meme about Yukarin being depressed and suicidal?
1It was only a pity kiss.
1Too bad it's just some guy making shit up with absolutely nothing to show for it, not even twitter rumor mongering or 2ch posts. I mean I wonder what Sunrise is up to as well since they've done jack shit on TV besides Gintama since last Fall season but I know better than to just run with whatever random shit some anonymous person posts on a shitty forum with arguably shitty people.
I need more Horizon.
7Studio 8 will find her groove.Midori is close exact relations to Yukarin.Her character is very positive still garner relationship with the professor and leader to HiME Sentai. Don't forget JYUANNUSAI
9twitter drama as always
4I don't disagree but I was more or less talking about the fact that it's not a new franchise. People already know and love the original cast. There is a difference in expectancy since you can directly compare them with the original characters. Not to mention that they have to compete with them. It was more of a quality related discussion than popularity. I don't doubt that they'll be exactly or probably even more popular.
7I'm really not sure when it was magically decided the original cast is leaving forever. It just seems like an idea that people just decided on and made reality in their heads. I guess the movie will give a better idea what's going on there this weekend but I really don't ever remember a publicity statement that said that Sunshine was flat out replacing Muse and that that was going to be the end of them come hell or high water. Peoples ability to just get ideas in their heads and decide that that is the one true reality and do so as a collective is both impressive and annoying since they can also no longer remember which ideas they just came up with and which were officially announced when some form of proof for or against presents itself in the actions of the actual creators.
8Yes but the problem is that they are comparing a franchise in it's early creative phases to one that is now established just as they were Muse to iDOLM@STER and then proclaiming it's shit in comparison. Like of course that's going to always be the case, people are comparing entirely different things and somehow people can't realize how irrational and stupid that is anymore. Like if Sunshine comes out and finishes and people say "well I think that was shit compared to Love Live" fine, because at least there will be an actual standard of comparison there instead of just shit people decided in their heads.
5Literally Fujo's free money
3I mean I wonder what Sunrise is up to as well since they've done jack shitI think they are restocking and reconnect their animation studios due to huge successes with LoveLive,Tiger & Bunny and others. Fall season is the focal point for Sunrise to flex muscles or everyone will asking what the hell is going on.
4
9It'd be hard to pull off the magic again.I also fear years of cart driver shitposting if any sort of answer is given.
5not T&B
quick question,If Sunshine fails and LoveLive loses it glory. Does Mai-HiMEfranchise suddenly reclaims that power full time.
7SunshinefailIt's just not going to happen.
4First is Cross Ange second seasonZegapainWhy would they make sequels to shows with meh sales?Mai HimeStudio 8 is busy with shows that are actually popular and relevantFrozen TeardropNovels aren't done yet and the head writer is working on Gundam The Origin now which won't be done until next year unless they extend it.
9Yeah,still it's going to be a success overall for Sunshine. I would like too see LoveLive seiyuu to join new Mai Hime series somehow. It would be a good deal for the fans to see the cast integrated with original HiME cast.
0wanting another Code Gay AssPlease leave
4Cross Ange second seasonGod please no. I got way too into CA and was completely pleased with the ending, another season will no doubt ruin the franchise.
5Mai HimeStudio 8 is busy with shows that are actually popular and relevantanon,Mai-HiME is actually relevant to Studio 8 because it's influence and popularity with Sunrise. Couple years ago they were interested on doing a 3rd Mai-series until new ideas come up with LoveLive. I still think they are plans to do it but nothing came to fruition.
4JYUANNUSAI
Yo this all sounds like bullshit how come nobody calling it out.
4Cross Ange 2nd seasonI don't think I can handle another season of fearing that Fukuda will kill Vivian off.
9because it's all speculah but we love Sunrise to death due to trainwrecks6FUKUDA WILLS IT INDEED
9nobody calling it out2nd post in this thread. And a couple more in between as well.
9But Sunrise is like 10 studios, they can't all be making in-betweens for other studions?
Sunrise being based.Nothing about Horizon.
3they kinda butchered Horizon anyway
5meh salesLike we know so much about the sales, merch included, as well as net profit.
5Did they say Mai-HiME had huge world views and had a huge success over toys and artbooks. I wouldn't surprise me Studio 8 is working on new HiME project right now.
0I'm conflicted about a second season of Accel World. The first season was good, but Reki is a hack and I'm afraid the story might turn to shit.
4Cross Ange second seasonI want to believe.
7This.
Cross AngeMai-HiMEAll I care about these two,all the other shit can fuck right off.
7Based on the LNs, the story becomes much better.Especially the Chrome Disaster arc.
7Accel Shit will never get a second season anyway
9There are 2 Build Fighters OVAs on the way as well. One for the first season and one for Try.
6If anything it will probably be about the fake world trying to attack the real world
3That or some backup plan Embryo had in the fake world where he is still preserved or something
0where he is still preservedThe original body of Kira Yamato
7Accel World still has some semblance of planning, so it'll never be as bad as SAO.But it's not like that's saying much.
Why would CA get a season 2 if it can't even get a single OVA?
Unless I get a king gainer sequel out of left field, I won't be happy.
0It will be focused worldbuilding and new invaders o take over both words. If Embryo returns then he would become some kind of virus that would affect mana system and other planets. I think we are going to see a planetary council who will look over the humans especially Ange and Norma since they are valiant heroes or nothing but bottom barrel scum like Mana. pic related I expect this character to make a return as the main villains or rivals to Ange
8Last BD could hint something about a continuation of OVA prelude Cross Ange has a potential for a couple years. Ange will still MC because she's cold hard cash to Sunrise.
6That or the main cast get thrown into some dimensional drift where all the fake worlds are starting to collapse back onto the real one.
2G-Reco should have been a King Gainer instead of a Gundam.
9The Mai-HiME thing is pure delusion at this point, but there actually might be something going on with Zegapain. Hell if I know why, or what a sequel would even be about, but I'm not going to complain.
6bringing characters back from the deadI would prefer Naomi over Sophia if that happened.
1That could work.All I want is an AngeXSophia duet duel for second season
5I find it impossible to rationalize that show as a success, but maybe I'm just thinking of it in terms of the average Sunrise series which almost always seem to end up as huge hits instead of just 5-6K ones that generate a little buzz.
0If for whatever reason they do another Zegapain they need to bring back Rocky Chack for another theme song
4Frozen TeardropBut like, none of FT sounds like any fun whatsoever.
Mai-HiME continuationYes pls.
6implying Sophia will recruit Naomi to join forces to shit on Ange middle class lifestyle0Studio 8 knows that the Mai-franchise is one of their huge successes.They have both projectsSunshine and new Mai-series in mind. 8DVD/BD's play a role but toys/artbooks could generate huge revenue.

6I care.
6ValvrapeS3HAHAHHA
6I'm still mad
Here is what Sunrise's four-series Kraken will actually be:more Love LiveLove Live spin-offHorizonCowboy Bebop 2
6Your mother cares,she and I will watch it together for the sequel
0Cowboy Bebop 2Fund it
8
Is it confirmed S8 will be doing Sunshine?
5she's cold hard cash to Sunrise.They'd get more money from just doing more Gundam shit.
6That was a contract job for Aniplex and almost certainly abandoned by them since it wasn't a 10K+ hit.
9Yes and with Mai-HiME continuation. I think that's the reason they are busy as fuck
3Source on both?
9Why would they not be?
7it's all speculah but it's possible
They've pretty much said absolutely nothing related to Horizon ever since it finished, and the most we know is that one of the people who worked in production fucking hated how much work they needed to do for it.So it's pretty unlikely, isn't it?
Reminder that Cross Ange is garbage
there are people actually looking foward to Frozen Teardrop
1Off with their heads!
8
2replying to a known /m/ shitposter.
9Well Sunrise always have garbage shit after Bones left and the last studio is now BNP property with Akitsu and Tribe Cool Crew. They have nothing to lose now only still continue to make the best originals and sequel they could muster out. We should be thankful this year and 2016 is sequel time for anime.
1Frozen Teardrop isn't that bad of a sequel.Maybe this time Heero will finish the job on killing Relena
8Heero will finish the job on killing RelenaHow would they do that seriously
1I seriously doubt the are gonna adapt the novel 100%, before the novel started it was stated that is just a "bridge" for a possible true sequel.
Cross Ange S2I want to believe damn it!
Maybe SEED movie is finally coming.
3Me too anon
2It depends on if they planned to continue it. All the merch sold out quite fast including the plamo, and the game's promo code ran out too so they sold what they wanted. Financies are not an issue but it was a risky series with all the questionable stuff.
3Sylvia maxI'm hype
6Not as good as Ange and i only stayed for Saki.
Just let CA die. It doesn't deserve a second season.
3It should continue same with Mai-HiME and LoveLive both great IP's with ton of potential for the long run.Based Sunrise will deliver
4Sylvia vs Ange vs Sophia duet duelmy dick is diamonds4It deserve a second season.Fixed.
3norma mama avenging her dead daughterHilda and Hilda 2 bondinginterdimensional war that eventually forces the normas to question sidesThis has so much potential. I don't even care that it ill be shit, i just want to have fun
5They could even pull a Megazone and make Ange the new Embryo while Salia's descendant is the new MC.
4Cross Ange second seasonWasn't the Sunrise studio who made get disbanded?
4or the could just have serra inexplicably survive and become the next mc.
5not even have Hilda family become unit known as "Breakout Family" not even seeing Hilda oba-san wearing her sexy MILF mail rider outfita man can dream
7cross ange 2 should just consist entirely of MILFs. Shophia, serra mom, hilda mom, misty's mom, vivian's mom.
7I never could understand your autism. Her mom was a manafag, why the fuck would she turn into a norma? Same for Hilda2.
0Yes, they were acquired by Bamco Pictures but there's talk of First studio who are doing Gundam Origin Movie right now is plans to do a second season.
8Arzenal needs single mothers and MILF to fill up veterans division. Hilda's mom top the charts for most kills and shit. Hilda's mom may take the spot as orgy gatherer
9You lost me son,get your autism straight son
3Nah. It didn't even deserve the second half of the first season.
0It's only a matter of time until we see another Code Geass TV series, even though there is no real guarantee it'll be a sequel instead of something completely different.
6I agree,second part of Cross Ange was pitiful. If second season could better that is someone or something will push Ange shit to the max. Hell,I hope Jasmine and Ange recruit the new Norma including males to push Arzenal into Outer Heaven.
I love Cross Ange I need more Cross Ange. I'll always love it despite everyone hating it. I've watched and love plenty of anime that /a/ hates along with MAL,Crunchy Roll, etc.
6Second cour of CA was worse, but the threads were much better. Some of the most active and fun threads I've been a part of in a long while, and with very little shitposting.
8Is there any successful female MC mecha anime?since it is very rare Cross Ange can be considered very success
6None
2CA actually ended up being fairly popular on those sites.Once you get past the initial retardation of the first few episodes, it does a good job of sucking you in and getting you invested in the characters.
6The shitposting was rampant though, remember the Salia haters?
6
Now for a quiz time
0That wasn't shitposting, that was good fun.And I say that as a massive Saliafag.
6
0Nigga please when HiME returns Symphogear will soon be relegated to smalltime
2same with Mai-HiME and OtomeThey always have the best characters,same with Cross Ange.
8They didn't flat out say Muse isn't returning, you're right on that part, but the cast of Sunshine so far is nine completely new girls, not even the younger sisters of Honoka and Eli. There's no relation to Muse at all outside of also being nine members, and I believe one of the short descriptions is that the group was simply inspired by Muse, nothing more.Personally I expect cameos in the last episode, or maybe sprinkled throughout, but to try to bring in a new group and keep the very popular last group around in the anime will just kill the new girls popularity.
I want a new Mai-HiME series,why the fuck Sunrise won't give it to us dammit
77Hilda's mom such a huge merely pretending slutI would lose my shit to see Hilda mom muff diving on Chris and Rosalie in bed
7the possibilities are now endless for second season
5I just want to see the remake Geass movies without Sunrise exec bullshitting and full on Goro Taniguchi
7Not at all, it made 20k both seasons so the staff's hard work wasn't for nothing and they were rewarded generously. Furthermore, this is one person you're talking about, I'm under the impression based on what Manabu Ono said that while it was tough in the beginning, it got more fun near the end when they began to reach the better part of the novels. They poured their heart and soul into Horizon and it paid off, they couldn't be happier.
5I want to believe anon,I really do7Did the staff mention about still interest of more Hime in the future
4and to thought Goro was on good terms with Sunrise
0I don't know. I just read an interview with the Horizon director so I can't say if the staff mentioned any more Mai-Hime.
0I'd much rather they had the director back doing another project like Planetes.
7Nothing will ever be Planetes again. I am cry.

Why does she like turkey so much?
I don't know, it's a shit tier meat.
7cause it's fucking delicious.what kind of retarded question is that?
1it's fucking delicious.no it isnt
7Her turkeys are doing iron man numbers and she dont care anymore
2yes, it is. especially the day after thanksgiving when you microwave the leftovers and salt it.
8yes, it is. especially the day after thanksgiving when you microwave the leftovers and salt it.trash
62Fucking plebs
It's her character trope so she looks interesting even though she'll never be as interesting as normal or disappearance Nagato.
7Maybe she enjoys poultry and/or visiting Graeco-Roman ruins by the beach
7Turkey is amazing.
1yes, your taste is trash, glad you admitted it
1Looks like someone has never had probably prepared turkey.
He isn't duck master raceTurkey is nice but a little too dry
7It's SHIT
9depends on whether you're having dark or white meat.
3Your mother hit you as a child, didn't she?
6SHITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
7Turkey is the worst meat. So dry and flavorless. Literally every other meat is superior.
7It's unique......considering Japanese eat KFC for Christmas, instead of turkey.
1It's funny that you can get more extravagant things at a KFC in Japan than you can at one in Kentucky.
1Turkey on ChristmasReal niggas eat lamb
7What makes it even funnier is that the KFCs get so busy, you have to make reservations for your food months in advance, and possibly wait in line for up to 2 hours.

6Seriously.
9Gravy mother fucker.Also if prepared properly it shouldn't need much.

Where were you when a high ranking demon general purposed his undying love for your sister?
9at work. There's more chapters after this right? How much more we got?
7I think one more but it will probably take another plus week to translate and by that time well have Ashia wedding
9Who married ashia?
4read the fucking thing
7Its not translated
1What are you stupid? It's all translated. Up to the second redundancy chapter.
7i said aisha you dumbfuck
7Are you retard? He asked Aisha not Norn
46Well he should have said something
Still waiting for the raw
Still waiting for a better images of Eris mom
1Dude think its a double release month.
The whole scenario seemed fake and unrealistic to the story. Even Orsted just said that she had to pester him to eventually marry her. It's basically just fanbait
8and?
8Is it really fanbait? Is there a hidden fansite out there dedicated to RuijerdxNorn?
1it's by the author, so I don't know what his beef iss.
8Still a better love story then some
8It was played as a joke. Being surreal is what made it funny.
8omake material after the main seriesjust fanbaitnah that never happens
Haven't read the story yet, but finally got some time during work to do so. Anyone wanna inform me if the maid and the mother of MC die or are they just staying at home with the babies?
6just read it
6 Bandits attack the village, kill his mom, the maido and Silphy and kidnap the girls. Paul goes out to get them back while Rudy goes full edge trying to become stronger.
3Just kill yourself3Kthx
6mother is a telepathic veggie
3 By "the girls" I mean the babies.
7Eh, her body is still working so pappy won't care too much.
4Just kill yourselfwould rather have everyone spoil a story that I'm too fucking lazy to read himself No, kill yourself.
4Nigga, I'm still reading the story. At what point did I say I wasn't gonna read it? You god damn shit nugget.
8did you not just ask this stupid ass question? 6
0How is that stupid?
6Maid lives with the mother taking care of her because she became a telepathic vegetable due to magic or some shit. She got trapped in a crystal and fucked up because of it.They live with Rudy.The maid dies of old age related to some injury she kept getting. Rudy kept healing it each year, but it kept coming back.Don't remember if the mother had anything.Also rudy dies at 74 having gone senile.
5ok, I'm going to have to ask you to think now. Why would somone who said this Nigga, I'm still reading the storyask a dumbass question like this Anyone wanna inform me if the maid and the mother of MC die or are they just staying at home with the babies?If they are still fucking reading it? And have the audacity to tell someone to kill themselves for telling said dumbass to just read the fucking thing?
3Don't forget the orgy that happened
9*someone
9Because I'm still going to read the fucking story, asking for a spoiler doesn't matter. Go away, summer.
8Roxy gets infected with the magic stone virus and Rudy goes to Millis with Cliff and big Z to steal the god level puri spell. Cliff dies and they don't make it in time. Hitogami taunts Rudi in his dreams and then he goes into a deep depression with alochol. Slyphy tries seducing him, but he just ignores her. She then has an affair with Luke and then they and Ariel leave to try and plan a coup. They fail and sylphy is stoned to death. This leads Rudy to burn the capital to the ground. He also has a bounty on his head from stealing the book from Millis and then bounty hunters go and kill his family and big Z at home. Left with no-one who cares about him, he travels the world in search of the dragon ruins in order to learn how to go to the void world and kill Hitogami. Rudy is a bitter old man by the end and gives up on life. He then travels back in time to make sure none of this shit happened to fuck with Hitogami as his last laugh
6asking for a spoiler doesn't mattertriggered
6triggeredIf you give a shit about a spoiler and that causes you to lose interest in the series, you never actually gave a shit about it.
6You're worse than those guys who read from wikis
The fuck is with you salty ass people. Is there something that happened recently that made everyone go autism? Even Kaezer has some autism freakout from what I could tell.Either way, it's not spoiling at this point. Series has been over for like a month.
5You're upset for no reason. Calm down.8Iunno man, I just wanted to know about the series a little more. No clue the thing even ended.
8We're bored, nothing to talk about since the story is over.
8guy says he hasn't finished the storyasks for spoilersSome people just can't deal with it
Wat I thought Mushoku tensei was over...Baka tsuki has everything translated...
0redundancy chapters
0There are extra chapters coming out detailing various events. Also fan service.
I wish Stellar Transformations was translated at the breakneck pace of Coiling Dragon.
7pappy dies
0Give 700 bucks.
5I wish I was rich enough to commission $80 chapters every day.
The new chapter was good, Rudeus being thick as a safe's door is always great. I really love the way he never knows what's coming to him even when it can be seen from space.  Looking forward to the climax of Rujierd and Norm's wedding
6Go away, summer.You went maximum pleb with that one. Cut it down with the misplaced buzzwords if you want people to take you seriously.
Gate seems nice
Meh, it's all right I guess.
5He looks like he's wearing a straightjacket.
9Is it me or does the manga do a much better job at connecting his mary-sue-ism with his past negative experiences?I tried to read the translated VN but it lacks something.
5Both manga and LN/web novel do a whole lot to reflect his inner thought process. Now if this became a anime or movie that would change dramatically as most books that change media lose all narrative of the characters inner thoughts and lose all the direction and build up the entire story has to offer.
8Don't think we'll get a full translation of the books, with the manga so far along, and the anime around the corner.On another note, MT anime when?
8Gate is filling in some of the void that mushoku tensei left behind. Hell I like the mc pretty well for all the laziness that is him
3He never went senile, that was a dream.
5They were all dreams in the ordering and story telling, but overall they all still happen.
5God I really like some of the character illustrations. Really a nice change...........Where is volume 7!!!
2"This summer", apparently.
8Still hate how there's no wiki for Gate though and there's like dozens of characters to keep track up
9Wikis are maintained by fans.It just means that Gate only has fans that are as lazy as Itami
Story's over, nothing left to talk about.Don't really care about reading further since it doesn't have Rudi in it, not interested in his children or sisters. Better to just move on to a new story.
1Well that's something I guess
5hey Kaezar the outline for Osted shoulder is non existant. The sites background color is too similar to Osted clothes just need to add a little outling in that area
8Debatable with manga ongoning and Ln novels hopeful coming out, redunacy chapters and the whole Akito thing mushoku tensei is far from dead
5 It was a possible, and most likely probable, future shown by Hitogami. Furthermore we got a short extract of postum book detailing stuff about him that matched with it, so it's pretty much called that it is cannon.
9So anyone thinks that Ruji might be a part of subjugating Laplace again seeing as the death of his people never happened or will his daughters just be far more op then ever before
K-On! vs Hibike! EuphoniumWhich group of high school girls is better?
8That RitsuI didn't want to fap now.
Both are dank, ok?
K-ON was much more fun.
K-On is a modern masterpiece that changed the shape of anime for years to come and has influences that reach across the entire world.Hibike is a meme show that will be forgotten the moment the season is over.
Am I the only person who couldn't find any reason to like or care about the girls in Euphonium? They just seemed so bland and forgettable.
8
Having seen it recently, K-On! is clearly better.3Every single character is boring outside Reina and Kumiko, and they're nothing special.
That's not even a fair comparison, the Keions are vastly superior and actually have characters/likable qualities. I may be biased because of mai waifu though.
Keions are only good for is killing.
K-ON! is objectively better, this coming from someone who likes both. No one will even give a shit about Hibike! after a couple months.
K-On! has good characters but Hibike has better moments.
4There is a moment in probably every episode of k-on that is more enduring than the entirety of euphonium
The one with Ritsu is best because it has Ritsu in it
Eupho didn't pass the 3 episode rule
It's tough cause Reina is so perfect you can't even rate on her on a scale of 1-10.
8You can't compare them. Both are good, have attractive character and are entertainig.
8Every character is boring outside Reins and Kumiko, and they're nothing specialWhat is Asuka?
But we all agree that every blackhaired girl post-Mio is better than her.
1Boring. If you like her, good for you.
8Do you honestly believe Hibike will be forgotten like that?If you do I can't help but feel sorry for your foresight skills.
8ChitandaWorst girl in Hyouka.TohkaHot but characterless and with a generic design that's done every season.TamakoHardly fits the archetype, but she was indeed cute.MitsukiSimilar to Tohka but in an even worse show.ReinaAlright so far, but completely different from Mio character-wise and not my preference.
3If you have an ensemble cast with a handful of character who are all roughly equal to each other, with this one or that one pulling ahead a little, depending on what you enjoy, isn't that better than having a much larger cast, but having this one girl like a sun blazing in the sky and blotting out the light of all the other tiny little flickering stars? I mean, maybe you like her more than any other character from any media, like most people that watch. But it's fair to say that having a cast this imbalanced might make it a worse show.
0Yes, you can.Don't say that because you can't articulate together a comparison.
8The one who doesnt have a cunt dyke.
8Euphonium is a lot better in technical terms. Kyoani has been perfecting their techniques of carrying over meaning via character gestures. They also managed to brush up their CG usage, voice acting, direction and general quality.K-ON has more waifuable girls, though. That's not something you beat.
is full yuri better than yuri with hetbaitI wonder
5K-onYuriOh boy, it is time for everybody favorite discussion.
8
5Both are yuri bait but k-on is not yuriThat one bit in the movie is as far as they'll go
8after dropping k-on 3 times I was able to turn my brain off and watch it.but I just simply can`t watch hibike whatever. all the girls look like granny`s with these dumb haircuts and so much drama.
2what about that part where mugi is fixating on sawako's ass
8Hibike is an okay drama, K-ON is the pinnacle of SoL.You can't properly compare them because of the difference in genre but it's clear what had or is having more impact on the industry, and I highly doubt Hibike will revered to the same degree as K-ON 5 years on.K-ON also has more likable characters and a few of them, particularly Azusa and Ritsu, also have very interesting personalities and backstories, which really should have been explored and developed further.
Best girl
2Yes she is.
2cow titsbest girl
2Pretty much
5She's better than her sister.

1Sorry you're so horribly horribly wrong for thinking the phone-in sister is the best.The best parts of the series were episodes 1-3. Everything after that declined.
1Holy fuck, how could I forgot Sabato?She was like the official girl of /b/ back in 2005.
would you guys eat the sausage?
1Hell yeah. I can't imagine how fucking good it would feel to eat that and then snuggle with my daki of my waifu.

3Dub puristsus
I remember the Cuuuut-o of the 1st OVA
3dub puristsangle beats
1The tension meter felt wildly inaccurate to me
3 You have to understand that most Otakus hated dub just for the sake of hating dubs even if the dub is great as they are most of the time.subtitles have ALWAYS been worse than dub, there's no comparison to be hadPOE'S LAW IN FULL EFFECT
2All I remember is people jerking off to Tenshi, everyone loving Bandanna dude, glasses being fucking RIPPED, and lots of anger and sadness over the ending.All in all pretty positive, I remember having a blast discussing it with everyone.
3PerfectDub puristsTry again.
6Watching this with /a/ would have made it so fucking enjoyable
2No need to get mad Yokoi.
Kanahana character winningThis is absurd.
3I've never seen subtitles match the dubs. And the subtitles have always been worse translations. And I've never enjoyed the subs more than the dubs of anything. There really isn't even a comparison to be had.I thought these people don't really exist.
2Is Isla the new Tenshi?
Has anyone gotten the Beta version of the VN installed properly yet? I tried a couple of programs and it still tells me that I don't live in Nipland so I can fuckoff.
3Just about to post this asking if it was one of you guys.
1No.She's the new Yumemi.

1No. Isla at least has emotions.
No one remembered this year;_;I didEvery year
1Hey, I can at least say I tried. Just failed miserably.
6No.
they still haven't finished AB?
9Just in time for first beat, coming out this month.
I hope Charlotte OST is as good as Angel Beats! was, knowing Key/Maeda's track record it should be.
1You need to set System Locale to Japanese.Also, you'll need the rsle loader thing to play it.Mine is called "[120304] rlse loader"
Are you ready for TK's VA Michale Rivas to shine again?
2Tenshibros are the best
2Fuck you! I made the thread the other day. YOU didn't remember.
, 
Will it be shit?Here's hoping that no
9 implying the anime won't be subpar to the manga implying no white smoke lines implying it won't flop completely.
J.C. StaffNo expectations
4I always felt like JC was more a 1/3 chance of being goodBut this one is definitely gonna be shit
J.C. is usually great at comedies.
3J.C. is usually great at comediesnot prison shool tier comedie
9Obviously. You can already tell from the trailer the huge gaps in quality, which is a shame because the manga's artwork's so good. Getting a blade of the immortal anime adaptation vibe.
9It will be either incredibly good or so bad it is good
4implying no white smoke linesGod damn it the thought of this already pisses me off
0Yeah, the trailer really did seem really shitty. The artwork was what originally got me into the series, but the characters are what hooked me.Well, at least I hope the seiyuus will do the characters some justice
Keep your expectations low and you'll enjoy it.
It's will be Okey, We've got a Crazy boy
No chapter fucking againSo is this turning into a bi weekly manga now?
0yep
0there was a chapter this week, just wait for translations, korean scans were posted earlier
1Dont mean this week. Theres no chapter till the 19th.
tfw glorious Assman won't get the glory he deserves
1Hana best KangokuThat cliffhanger really got me on the edge
9JC StaffPrepare for QUALITY after episode 1.
7It depends on who they let do AD and how much dosh they wanna spend.
6RIP Chairman Assman, we barely knew ye
If you go into this with any expectations or thinking it'll be good, you're going to have a bad time.
493It's always feels annoying some people only check the studio but complete ignore the main staff.
8Did you watch the trailer? No amount of good staff is going to save this.
Holy shit that cliffhanger. I had yet to read it.W-what's going to happen? I liked Mari, but fug that last chapter was glorious.
The trailer reminded me of Detroit Metal City animation style. I don't know why...
0Meh, I never saw anything from JC, so I'll watch it with low expectations, since that animation can't and won't beat the original artstyle4Mari's a lesbo now, boy. Well, at least as far as I know.Hana still best USC
3Mari's a lesbo now, boy. Well, at least as far as I know.Nah m8, she's bi. Or so I hope.God damn that scene of hers made my dick diamonds like nothing before.
9Yeah, bi can work too.But man, she went all in with Kate, them lesbo tendencies went all apeshit on that scene
6implying it's the studio that decides where the budget goesNot to mention DanMachi has only 2 episode 3 and 8 with sakuga and episode 3 has like only 30s of sakuga. Their production committee can easily give them money for two fights.
I suppose this happens with lots of manga, but the colors aren't what I thought they'd be. For some reason, even though I had seen previous covers, I had thought Hana's hair would be super blonde to almost white, and here eyes would be reddish pink. The yellow-orange just doesn't seem to work. And don't get me started on the poor VP.
9She's never shown anything but hate for men, save for Kiyoshi's man-arse.
9If anything, I think that the anime Hana hair isn't orange enough. Some of the covers shows the ends of her bangs really orange8Mostly daddy issues though, since the Chairman is a huge perv. However, that side still wasn't fully explored
9Main character voiced by Kamiya.Dead on arrival.
I hope its not shit, as long as Principal has the correct voice that i imagine it sounds like.
9What is an ideal Arse-man's voice?
6Wakamoto
That feel when we will never ever get an Ore to Akuma no Blues anime, or even a proper end to the manga.
0Except it have one of best director to direct this show.
6
Funny that 2ch people's prediction sales of this show went from 5k to 10k after staff announced, of course it's not because JC Staff, it's because Mizushima.
79Mizushima that good, huh?
9GuPShirobakoWCWJoshirakuYeahAlso he proved he can make everything become comedy, even Blood-C and Another.
0Please yes.
6Akio Otsuka
7Yeah I doubt Prison School will sell 5k let alone 10k because of some Director.
, 
Once again, nothing happened. Should I kill myself already?
3You should kill yourself so there's one less retard making generals for this shit.
No, just stop reading trashy harems.
1oh come on is not that bad
Havent been following this manga butlemme guess, everyone still thinks theyre boyfriend and girlfriend?
9the same shit of new years happen again
Looks like they're animating the Shuu and Sensei arc
3IMAGE FOR ANTS
Nisekoi develops like it's not developing refer to the recent story regarding the padlock and key, NOTHING SPECIAL HAPPENED. Bet the author still think of milking while it last. If wanna argue, regroup and shout out together I suggest
6You don't even need to read the image to know what's happening. Because nothing's happening, anon-kun.

Watashiya did it again. Could Kodomo no Jikan be only her first masterpiece?
Kodomo no Jikan is garbage. Sorry you were stupid enough to think it's a masterpiece.
3Shotposting is against the rulesIm enjoying her new series but the sameface is too strong
1You should watch Striprism.
1damnthe drawings still looks like KnJ but with different hair coloring
1cute as fuck facessamefaceWhats the problem?
1I doubt it will be better than KnJBut it's still early.
7I can't help but see the characters from KnJ when I look at these new characters, but it's only a short little confusion. I hope there's more romantic tension. I realized recently that I enjoy stories with a taboo romances like age gaps or incest and the like.

7It doesn't make much sense. Seems to me like someone just bundled together both the headline and the lead of a news article, but here it goes:Child and Exams: When I was little, I would get confused with what they were trying to teach me. Nowadays, I look back and realize how important it was to learn that.Like I said. Weird.
4I just translated it in google and got the same thing.
Does anyone remember the name of the Alice / mizuryuu kei work in which the MC has a dumb but hot neighbor who let's him have sex with her?
8Are you seriously that lazy?
7I looked it up on sadpanda and nhentai, just the artists name, and couldn't find it
5Check the 3rd and 5th result.
5Lazy and a liar.
4It actually turned out that it's "mizuryu kei" on the tags, not "mizuryuu kei", so the results were MUCH fewer

I find it interesting to fap to something weird. Post the weirdest stuff you have fapped to.
3If you want to go even deeper down the "you're just misunderstanding things" hole, it turns out I was searching nglish instead of english. Truly, reality is nuanced.
8Post the weirdest stuff you have fapped toread it once. Never again.
4manga and doujinshi deselected outYou're a funny little shithead.
This artist has good anatomy. Actually looks like a realistic woman

2Wani mag scans are my favorite time of the month. Three of them today, too.
0Wow, the rabbit hole goes even deeper. The number of fuck ups is pretty colossal. I had it set to "CG" so I could look up "alice" and find the CG set she did so I could look up Mizuryu Kei but then I forgot to cut it off.I hope you're just as fascinated by just how many factors led to this misunderstanding as I am.
god that everything.Come on refractory period, end faster, I need to fap a bit more to this.

2How do you even search for galleries like this? They're not on the frontpage. And normal search doesn't show these

4You're looking at the wrong front page.
5
6What front page am I supposed to looking for? I see the gallery under manga and it's not there. I mean my frontpage is for all categories.
8Ex is 1 hour behind the main site.
5Oh, so it's on g.e? I see them now.Do you know if nhentai rip from g.e or ex?
3I would assume g.e since they probably get banned often from whatever downloader they use. Not practical to continue making new accounts to get into ex.
What fate awaits the NotHonoka, the adventurer?
0358Can you people really not access every visible gallery on g.e by now?
3From what I understand, you have to donate to get it. So no, hell no.
0Yeah, I thought so too. Also, if ex is one hour behind there's a chance for the galleries to be deleted before it even appeared on ex and nhentai won't be able to rip them.3I can see them just fine on g.e. I was checking on ex since I don't even go on g.e.
4I mean why bother going on ex at all? The index is 1 hour slower. Literally no point.3you don't have to donate.
6g.e still doesn't have lolicon and other shit
6Care to enlighten me then?1That's what he's talking about.
1You sure about that?
0Eh I don't know. Haven't really been following the threads for some time now. As long as I can access them on ex I'm fine. And also I hate the background color on g.e. I can probably change them but I'm already used to ex.
3Actually looks like a realistic womanAnd that's why he is a bad artist.
this jewbag seriously asking people to pay for a copy ogf the uncensored version?

2Yes.
9How long until a bro uploads it?

what's the sadpanda 4chan extension you guys use these days
7Here in 4chan, Exlinks. Outside, didn't even knew there was any.
8oh, there's a thingy that makes chrome extensions way more convenient nowi stopped using exlinks when i kept having to force developer modeno need now thanks hupo
2What thingy is this?
5tampermonkey
7Oh, that. Yeah. Exlinks is on my Tampermonkey too. Chrome finally received its version of greasemonky.
What are your shittily drawn and unchanging comics that you still whack off to because you had a mental line added to your brain when you were a youth?Mine is Crimson Comics.

You have great taste, drozetta.
8All those no bubble text. Nigga gotta be dedicated for that.
2How are you supposed to keep up with these, I already have enough trouble trying to keep up with random eromanga and these have the added problem of needing to get them quickly before a purge happens.Damn, collecting and fapping to porn is a difficult hobby.
Is there ANY doujin with a loli mom? Like, she's 30 or 40 or whatever but looks like a loli.
2I'd rather have the original material, white bars are easy to ignore anyway.I feel for people who can't stand any kind of censors though. And I have no idea how they're still reading this kind of porn if they're like that
7Taihei TengokuQdou KeiOh boy. Makes me wanna work on one of them, but there are other tanks dated around 2009-2014 that needs some attention.
9Taihei Tengoku has such fun stories.
92009*cough* Karma Tatsurou Tsuya Mama *cough*
2
finished these one. Loved it.
2Give me an estimate on how quick someone will pick up that Taihei Tengoku work? Because I'm kinda certain that DJM is going to pick that shit quick.I'm kinda looking towards Qdou Kei's work right now. Here are the other tanks I have on my list:me an interesting list of tanks from that year range. Because I can't just work on boatsluts forever.5It's like you want me to disappear forever. Noted.
5Taihei doesn't seem to be translated often. Just whenever someone is willing to pay. But you never know with these things.
1kek
5Here's some stuff that doesn't get much attention.other tanks by these artists that aren't translated as well.
Here's another tank with it's chapters translated but not yet edited into the tank scans[Yuzuki N' LV.X+] Ane Kyun! ~My Sweet Sweet Elder Sister~
6netorareSure, I'll check it out again. I'd prefer it if the work has a lot of anal on it.
0I don't know of any that specifically focus on anal since I don't really keep track of the fetishes in tanks. Having that said here's something with a metric fuckton of fetishes.it's one of the most popular galleries so chances of translation at some point might be higher.
0href="#p126399953" class="quotelink"3There's a bounty for that.
3I could work on it, since I already put work on one of the chapters some years back, and others are already translated.But given that there are 5 out there that wants the e-cash which I don't give a dick about, given my current wealth, I'd have to pass.3Bai AsukapregnancyanalConsidered.After this boatslut I'm working on, I'll get on with a tank, or work on a series of gay doujin that some group left behind.
5SHITFINALLY
5MUDA DA
anyone know of any good vanilla/harem doujins with gaijins in them? Like a series with a cute black girl or white girl.
/a/, I'm scared. I fapped to a futa on male doujin and am worried that I'm gay. Is futa on male gay or is it just an advanced version of pegging?
0It's the ultimate pegging.Now, stop being a faggot and link me to it.
I thought I'd ask here, does anyone know what's up with sankakucomplex?
2
have to slay the hardmode panda because I forgot the stupid name I made up from back when it was easy
What the fuck is this? First time seeing it.
7how has no one made a site to depose these stupid bronies yet
7You have an image limit of 5000 +3 every minute, capped at 5000Realistically, the only way to hit the limit is to use a downloader. So you should probably stop that.
2For the same reason why you don't.
3maybe he just has a vast hunger
3Damn, I used that eze add on that I picked up in yesterday's thread. I guess I'll get rid of it then.
3Assuming you were like speed-reading at one page per 5 seconds, it would still take ~9 hours and 15 minutes to hit the cap. And that's without a single break.There's just no way you can hit it by reading normally.
4it would be a low point
4I tried to download these 2 2But the 2nd one failed so I reloaded and tried again, after 49% it gave me the notation. That's only about 1k pages, not even close to 5k.
if I install their stupid botnet will it trick it into letting me in faster
Is Exlinks broken for anyone else on Firefox?It has been broken for at least two versions now.
2Nope, latest version of firefox here using grease monkey and exlinks 2.3.3.
2No
3/a/ - Anime & Manga
31Weird...I have normal Firefox last version, and yet the gallery names are not 'transformed'.It just puts a [Ex] before every link, without giving me the mouseover info or changing the name.
Who are the best male on futa artists? I'd say Kurenai Yuujii and Red-Rum, but they're probably too mainstream.
5Have you disabled mixed content blocking in firefox, you need to go to about:config search for mixedcontentblocking and set:security.mixed_content.block_active_contentto false otherwise firefox blocks non stuff on a page.
5I did that, but it didn't change anything
Tell me something, anons.What are the most cunning rape doujins you've ever read?I think you know what I mean. After all, respect for women is very important in rape doujins, and a woman and a plot interesting enough to rape is very important,
3Anything by Oyster
6Bit too hard for me.
What are the best galleries/artists for tongue/kissing fetish?Bonus points if mixed with impregnation, ahegao or NTR.
6Like this one?href="#p126411539" class="quotelink"9Fue does tongues.
Is it just me or is sadpanda has way less stuff now?
9"Now" compared to over a year ago?
2There was still Kairakuten and X-eros left?I thought it was all long gone. Or were this new galleries?
0Or were this new galleries?Look at the dates and used your noggin
Does anyone know where all the raws are of this series?shit is so cool, i don't even want it purely for fapping purposes. He turns creepypasta into doujins, like Junji Ito of fapping.Theres only 2 on sadpanda.
tfw no tag for beachesI just want to read some comfy beach rape every now and then, especially during summer
4In Japan
1there are no tags for many other things
6Like vanilla?
1There is one. On Fakku.
2The reverse image search doesn't work for .jpgs for me on chromium.
9That's because they've deactivated it, since 4chan resamples .jpg images and makes exsearch impossible for them.
09no, 4chan strips exif data from jpgs, changing its hash. It doesn't resample.

Here's a manga.
Anyone wanna help me translate some Wani? I can guarantee release within 2-3 days.I wanna do that Napata story from May Kairakuten right now.
4Help you how?
8By translating the story obviously.
post cute gay traps
6Nothing gay about a trap.
6I think he meant the traps are gay, i.e., their sexual orientation.
4Thank you!
8Why would you waste your time when fakku said they were going to release it uncensored?
5Because I don't want to pay a dime to Fakku?
6I didnt say pay for it, I was saying you're an idiot to waste your time making an inferior version
5fakku
5Wait fakku is releasing napata uncensored!? when did this happen
4What can you do?
0I would, if not for the fact that lolishit is fucking disgusting.
5Yes and they just put up that unscanned loli succubus anal chapter
6/out/
5I can edit and pretty much clean anything you throw at me.
5They are going to release less than a couple of % of what they made exhentai remove. You have to be literally retarded to trust Jewcob.
I need something good with anal.
Girl has bangsOne position has her bangs fall over her head, exposing her foreheadThere is no greater joy.
I'm on the vibe for some sweet, loving pegging. Anybody got anything for me?
2just say you have a 5head fetish
8those comments
9I actually really like bangs, in fact with characters like Ritsu or Rider I would have preferred if they had bangs instead. I just find it special to see a sudden change in hairstyle, I guess.
5Who cares? Exhentai would have had to remove everything regardless of fakku, now we at least get uncensored awesomeness
I need saggy milf tittieslike not disgusting, but you know, I want them to have a more mature, out of shape body type
5thats what nhentai is for. the sooner the ponyfag is replace the better
8nhentainot even once

suddenly see the sadpanda againOh shit I don't even use the plugin. I signed into the other super secret sight and logged in but still see the panda/blog
2Clear cookies, log into g-e, then add the x to the address.Should be retard proof.
6Weird. Never had to change the address rather than just signing inafter clearing cookies and going to exhentai.
Anyone got any vaginal vore?
Can anyone help me remember this doujin?loliloli is a mangaka ?beginning is in a restaurant the male is a young adult and has messy hair and maybe some crude facial hairthey go back to his apartment
5Its probably an unnecessary step, its just what I've always done.
6Never mind, found it.
5FAKKU is not the same thing as Wani, and the latter is the one sending the mass takedowns, and they would have happened regardless of the FAKKU publishing deal since they started doing it before anyone was even thinking about a publishing deal, and in fact the publishing deal came about because FAKKU also received the same takedowns from Wani as everyone else.
8here we go again
8Is it safe to assume that fakku will be publishing kairakuten and x-eros? Given all these unscanned chapters they've been putting on the site for free
8DaizFuck off, Fakku shill. This is would not have happened if it wasn't for Jewcob and the deal he made.
0You're an idiot. Wani is the one that forced eh/ex/fakku to remove everything
sadpanda is just the batoto of hentai. it's even worse because it locks content in a walled garden and forces you to jump through hoops to view content. there is no reason any of you should accept that when there are countless alternatives that aren't such shit
9Yeah, FAKKU will start publishing both Kairakuten and X-EROS digitally in the near future.0I just posted an image that shows FAKKU got takedowns from Wani along with many other sites to get rid of their content. It's the thing that made Jacob get in touch with Wani and which eventually lead to the publishing deal. Which should make it obvious that Wani decided to start sending takedowns before anyone was thinking about any kind of publishing deal.
7countless alternativesSuch as...?
9Fakku of course.
1spending money on hentaiNope.
Well the thread is ruined. Time to go home.

5Not if we makes this a Fakku thread instead.
5just wait another 20 posts for everyone to get it out of their system and start posting again on topic again
9Hahahahahhahahah. That's why when registering in things when my info isn't sensitive, I just use the same login and pass.2Well, to be perfectly honest, a few months ago, I did buy a tanko here in one of the newsstand near my work by accident. Thought it was an ecchi.
8Looks like the brainwashing is effective, from some of the replies.
7walled gardenhoopsSomeone's tech illiterate. It takes all of 15 seconds at most to get into panda. Unless, of course, you're retarded.
3slut whiteknightsDisgusting.
3I think he was mentioning the secret, secret club inside panda.
3It takes at least a week once you create an account on eh, so yeah that is a hoop you need to jump through. it really is stupid
3He was talking about the secret secret club that most of you plebs don't have access to because you didn't donate enough shekels to the ponyfagHere's an example: 
3If that's the kind of thing there is there, then I don't mind. Not into creatures.
3True-removed.
3That doesn't exist.
3To you.
8One, you don't have to be a week old. I've tested it. Two, why the fuck are you now just creating an account? Fucking newfags.
32Not even mods or catgirls can see it. So no, there is no secret secret club.
Speaking of purged content, is there a dedicated uploader for it on nyaa I can keep bookmarked?

6Turns out I did the same thing and used my generic password for it aswell.Problem now is that it claims my account doesn't exist, eventhough logging in on e-hentai works perfectly fine.
2If you installed the plugin recently, restart your browser. It solved for me.
1Tried a few different things involving IP changing and apparently it refused to let me in with my german IP but a rumanian one worked.I swear, this site does the weirdest shit sometimes.
4Yeah, heard it blocked some conutries out. For some reason. Good thing they are leaving the jungles in peace.

8Sorry this one took me a while. Been editing other things in between playing witcher3.
8Any older woman who appears to be within the age range of 30-50. Does not need to be a mother.That's not a milf.
4MILF tagDoes not need to be a mother.Totally missing the point.
0The point is that milf tag shouldn't be used for anything other than mothers.
7I'm talking about the description, not about your comment.
9It's seems so perfectly obvious now that you have pointed it out that I have no idea how I could have misunderstood what you were saying.
0Does not need to be a mother.Who the fuck wrote these tags. God this site is such shit
Serious question, why does /a/ hate nhentai? I see nothing wrong with it.
4It's okay, it just happens.1I like that place since that's one of the places where I get my raws and share my works. But at the same time, I am disappointed that there are bumbling idiots rolling around.
8Honeypot
8It's just a rip of the resized images from ex. It has wani, but it also disallows certain content. There are better sites that rip nonresized images.
8honeypotFor what reason.
8Because it rips the gallery images, it's inferior to ex for everything that isn't Wani. And because there are places with much more complete Wani backups, it's also shit for that.There's actually zero reason to use it.
59What are the better sites then?
8I'm not going to advertise them any more than they already have been. The only bone I'll throw you is that one of them was talked about in a recent panda thread.
95stop being delusional and scare newbies nhentai is good for wani and there are no better alternatives for viewing them if you count out nyaa because it's downloading.stop spreading misinformation.
8There's that buzzword again.
exhentai.org/g/819814/57c97e5480/
5Cunnypot
2I don't really like discussing things that have been discussed about for many times. I'll bite.for viewing waniSure it's good for viewing, like Batoto or some online manga reading source. The key here is, "just viewing". But for downloading, it's lackluster, and there are better places to get them.In the first place, you shouldn't just view them, given their volatile nature. You should jam them in your hard drive and read it there.stop spreading misinformationscare newbiesThey're not scaring you.

I'm not liking how most of the new release are full censorship nowaday. Bring back the black bar please
5it's not boxing day yet, I can't afford a new external
7Kairakuten xtc went back to black bars this month. I think I heard core was doing the same.
5My only problem with this and others that keep a list of deleted content is they never update often. I don't even need download links. Just give me a list of shit that was purged recently so I can make sure I missed nothing.
4went back to black bars this month.Not back to, it was always full censorship. This issue was the first time it was black bars.
6Whatever the case, it's still a sign of improvement.
5Oh god those tits. No idea how I didn't know about that Taihei guy.
know if all of this is being translated? I know a few chapters already are. I want to edit it all into the tank scans. They have much less censorship.
Anyone know where this is from?It's the first somewhat interesting h-panel i've seen in two weeks, I need this.
That one doujin you just can't stop fapping toWhat's her name, /a/?

2ow yeah thats what I meant, female:crossdressing.
What artists has a similar style compared to Hirame?I've always had a sick obsession with his work, and i'm still absolutely fascinated by the way his style, but there's only so much to work with. Can anyone recommend someone similar?
7Wait really, I thought they caught everything
3I thought they caught everythingNah, there are still works out there that hasn't been purged. In a perfect world, it would be better if it stays that way.
3Nope. It's missing a bunch. Particularly alternate scans of certain mags that are higher quality. Like it has the viacheslavovich scans but not the mikocon ones for a bunch. Mikocon being the much higher quality.
9Ever heard of mega?
4mega takes shit down just as fast these days.
4I've already been DMCA'd twice on it and I don't want my account deleted.
9translating chapter 2 before chapter 1What retards
9Sine their not doing old issues of kairakuten and x-eros it's gonna be stupid as hell when they're translating stories that started in previous mags. Expect this for a while.
9BeforeImplying they'll translate the first one any time soonMaybe when Napata gets a new tank.

3Ever heard of Pomf, Uguu, Mediafire?
1Have you ever heard of DMCA takedowns?
9Not a big problem with Pomf/Uguu.
3More of a problem than just chucking it in a multiupload service and getting a whole bunch of links instead of one target.
2female:milf removed from the tagsNo wonder I can't find it.Why though?
class="quote"70 pages of pure dialogueOh well, still pretty hot
8Yeah, I uploaded like 8 days ago and it still hasn't been taken down.
1Oi don't say that, they'll take it down.
2That one Maruta one-shot where childhood friends have sex and the boy tells the girl she's pretty
2It's been so long it's already spread across the internet. No point worrying about it being taken down on e-hentai when it's achieved immortality.
Trying to remember the title of a H-manga I read and wanted to check for any new chapters and couldn't find it through tags. I know it has drugs, prostitution and incest and the synopsis is a very plain girl decides to change her style to get friends, boyfriend and a social life but everything goes wrong from this point a guy takes advantage of her in a karaoke booth, her dad has sex with her, mom finds out kicks her out, she gets into heavy drugs and prostitution. Was heading down a really dark path. Any help on the title so I can save it. Thanks.
1Yup, it took days before they got this down, and I never gave them the chance to rename it to their proper title as I did that myself.I want to make it easier for the archivers to save it, and the RGB to put it on their site.
6Emergence by ShindoL.It was Wani'd.
What are some good "all the way through" scenes without gore?
3What are you 12? Every site needs to reply to takedowns these days. Pomf/uguu are no different
7It was Wani'dI'm not even surprised anymore.
0Is there a name for that kind of face?
5Wani publishes the best stuff.

4Basically Tomoko with a spine.
7dammitthat series evolved from fap to be on my actual reading list. Checked it on the database and it's marked oneshot complete How many chapters were there in total?
7Tomoko is a bitch and has never been bullied.
0There is a Japanese word for it but fuck if I haven't forgotten it. It was on the Japanese nico meme page for the smugly grinning Japanese young 3DPD girl if anyone knows what I'm talking about
0Five. It's probably still not over, though.
Anyone know the title of this one where 2 highschoolers or college kids walk by a school and notice a dark-skinned loli they used to play with? They call her over and fuck her.
5oh and she is in track and field or something
53it this?
1Still annoys me that Namboku's Koibito Rule wasn't purged until his latest tank was uploaded. So when that one showed up the older one got purged off too...
3And that one was around for almost 3 years. Not that I mind it's purging since I've had it on the hard drive for years now.
They don't know about the new sicrit club
67hey we have this vague picture that might be you and you can easily pass of as somebody else, so now blow everyone in our school while we film you and we wont tell anyoneyeah as soon as they use that kind of blackmail im out. Its just too stupid to be used.
4hentai isn't exactly where you find the pinnacle of logic, anonI'd say the sex isn't likely but tell you the truth, 90% of the ways people have sex are even dumber than hentai situations
7I find that really hard to believe.
1Knew a girl who had sex for an ice cream cone onceI mean it wasn't JUST for an ice cream cone, there was talking involvedBut still
0The pleasure of being cummed inside?
Best Succubus stuff?

4know it.
why nhentai doesn't comply with all the DMCA shit but sadpanda immediately delete everything?
3Why do you ask this so often?
3Because the guy running the panda is a cowardly faggot.
Where my nipplefuck brothers at?should be a tag for nipplefuck nakadashi
7This is the time I ask, I don't lurk in those threads often
1Pretty sure he has a big cock.
Why is this tagged as femdom?
3Same for nyaa or luscious.
0You sure are upset at a guy who provides the largest source of printed hentai on the web, which loses him money. I guess it's unreasonable for him to want to stay out of legal trouble.
0Sadpanda tagging system is terrible
4I guess it's unreasonable for him to want to stay out of legal trouble.It is.
6It really is. So many tags that get voted in are just plain incorrect, and it makes searching impossible half the time.
0Autists think girl on top is femdom.
8Then report the mistaggings on the forums.
2forums
2Im here, problem is most nipplefuck is tentacle or something with so much cum and other bodily fluids you can't see the action.
2forumsNo one wants to be part of the shitty community on there
7Wani'dI hate this word
63Well then don't expect taggings to get any better.
7There is one.
3I think he did at one point since wani was down on nh for like a month. Guess he moved them to different servers or something.
47He's also actually a gigantic My Little Pony fanboy. And you're all lining his pockets with pony toys.
6I've been using g.e even before sadpanda existed and have never ever donated a single shit.Thoug he might be an obnoxius mlp faggot, I have be grateful for his site.
6Man, you get trolled pretty easily, huh? How rustled are you?
Does this shit just not work on mobile or am i a retard.
8Can you access sadpanda without the extension on browser?If so, it'll work on mobile.
6It's not a troll. Tenboro is actually a gigantic pony loving faggot.
8Damn you are gullible.
4Depends on the browser really.
0You poor anon. You actually think he's trolling. Just ask Joe. Tenboro is a confirmed ponylover and so am I
8It works on my phone, even on my Wii.
8Here's a picture to go with it
There's this one Bleach doujin that I've never been able to find on sadpandaWhich ends with Rangiku and Toushirou both naked and bound and humiliated in front of Aizen and coAnyone know what it's called?
7nvm actually called Gentei Mi Kaijoand i had it saved to my bleach folderwow
need more stuff like this anal+tomboy loli. All I can think of is Mizu and that's it...
6Was just thinking there needed to be more tomboy anal earlier today when I 'read' this.
Post the doujin/manga that started one of your fetishesis love

3TOO SHORT.
Trying to find a doujin I've read before but can't believe I didn't save. It's a girl with a mirror in her bedroom. Her future self from tomorrow comes out of the mirror and they have glorious self-cest. With each chapter more and more future versions of herself from other days in the week come out for threesomes and more.
7I know exactly which one you're talking about, don't think I can remember its name either.

A modern masterpiece. An anime for true men who wanna cry.

Overrated.Very predictable and corny. Oh wow, the aniki character died in the most retarded way. No one saw that coming.Second half was all over the place, since it wasn't a finished adaptation i'd assume. Half the characters were completely pointless and not developed at all.7/10

1As plebs
8She's still hot, it's okay.
0Who cuddles with him the most?
8Bat is Fire and Shadow.
89Does doll have any body heat? I think she probably doesn't or it would give her away to the Fire Sisters.
88Vamps are undead so yes. Technically koyomi is dead too.
01You will never use araragis six pack as a chair while you shit post on /a/
4She has no body heat because she's a corpse. She's also basically retarded because of having gone through brain death, which explains the posed look / peace peace stuff.
1The girl who will be with him forever.
1But has bat ever complimented his looks anon? She's not impressed, she's seen it all before.
5LITERALLY accepting the worse Snake as your waifu
0Well, we know Doll kissed him, and we assume Monkey gave him a blowjob. Considering the age difference and normal lewdity levels I'd say they're equally attractive.
8blowjobShe gave him a brojob. She isn't into het.
2Senjougahara will find a way to get rid of Shinobu so she can have a proper marriage.
2Hitagi probably cuddles him the most while he's awake, and then Shinobu probably cuddles him while he sleeps.
8Fuck, why live?
6So is a brojob a handy or oral? Or does she mix it up?
8Remember when bat  ripped off her fucking arm to save his life?
1I didn't anon. I will always love best Snake.
1Why not both?
4implying RRRG would be okay with getting rid of his soulmate for a marriage. He will just fuck Crab till she is dead. Then he has is soulmate for the rest of his lifespan.

I can't hate snake because I sympathize with her.She is lazy, childish, irresponsible, making excuse all time, and anti social. She is worst as person yet I like her. At least she is cute tho
1I enjoy fighting for Bat and arguing against Crabfags.
3I used to be a disciple of the monkeybutt but now I think it's a sin to ignore the glorious rest of monkey.
why not bird?
8we assume Monkey gave him a blowjobKeep your self insert fan fiction away from actual discussion.
0more quality monkey pics I don't have yettruly based anon
96I don't know what you heard about meBut known to niggas as Monkey,No boyfriend, no longhair, you can't seeThat I got a motherfucking B-O-O-TYShe looks straight gangsta with that bandaid.
1actual discussionWhere? Did you see it run by somewhere around here?Quick, if we hurry we might catch it.
0I think you mixed up your word for adorable with gangster anon.3sexulizing loli monkey is a sin lower than even snakefags can sink to.
2Roll in the Bug with me, you could watch meFrom my backseat to my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
1Yes. Good point man. I can't believe niggas think Hitagi wasn't just asking for a walk home either. Such Fujos.
8fucking monkey while she's strapped backwards in a car seat
It's time for "Nadeko has a better ass" but I can't find any examples, other than this 9
5If you're snakeposting without a healthy dose of delusion you're doing it wrong anon.
8author knows kanbaru is all bark and no bite when it comes to sex so she must wear panties under her spats
Monogatari's Hardest Women to Get:1. Monkey2. Bat3. Doll4. Snail5. Bird6. Bee7. Snake8. Crab9. CatLet's see what you've got.
2I'm just trying to follow the itinerary. 6
8That artist is really good, i hope he do more with the other girls too.
8Bee way too high anon, she'd be easier than snake.
8Nadeko Rising: Revengeance
8Bat is surely harder to get than Monkey, she's a highly arrogant supremely powerful demi-god, Monkey is just a dyke.Also Snake would be by far the easiest to fuck.
8I know anon, so you just have to post snake ass and claim it's better, regardless of how it is in reality.
58"Oh Anon, stop making me so horny..."
8Kind of hard to get unless you are a qt grill.
1This is /a/. What do you think everyone is?
3Oh shnake....
0watch a fun-loving mod be in here
50Oh shnake... cont.
5It's okay, we aren't doing anything with this thread anways
00Open your mouth. I've got a nice tasty taser for you.
8Snake is BY FAR the easiest to get. She literally offers to fuck the first time she meets the ragi.Everyone else at least needs a little effort to get anywhere at all. This inherently makes snake the worse, she's probably infected with all sorts of diseases.
088I think it should be qualified if this list is to just fuck or actually get with.
3With the exception of Snake and maybe Bee I don't think you could fuck any of them unless you "got" with them.
0She did meet Araragi before, since she is childhood friends with Tsukihi and all.
Ah, these threads... you guys are the best.
Why do people think monkey gave him a blowjob? I always thought she put a finger up his butt or something.
5Even Cat? No other girl wants it as much as she do.
1She also says something like it'll only hurt for a bitWhen she goes in for rape
9In all seriousness, this is more likely. But it's fun to imagine them doing various bro-sexual acts.
1The New Pervert TriumvirateCrab, Vamp, and Catwould probably not be hard to coax into bed. Araragi might be a little harder because you might have to 'explain further'
9Why do people think monkey gave him a blowjob?Because they're stupid and ignore both how wildly out of character that would be and how nonsensical to the plot that would be.
9Sorry 3 was for you
5But that's the thing, snake might be easy to fuck really hard to get with. Same with monkey if you're a qt girl. Meanwhile someone like cat you can't fuck unless you get with her but it would be relatively easier to do.
9Rips his pants and underwear off with her face in his crotchThis is generally when a blow job happens. But I'm with 9she probably fingered his butt. With her Monkey arm.
9Yeah I'm pretty sure that's too far too. She probably just pulled down his pants and underwear.
5Why would he scream like a ghost girl if he was getting a blowjob1I dont think its too far especially when she is trying to prove her lewdness
1Ripped off his pants and underwear.caused him to scream loudly.made him reconsider molesting Snail."It only hurts at first"Something more than "Wow, look how perverted I am with your dick in my face" is just a guuuess. But there's no proof.
Why don't they just make this series a hentai? The animation is already subpar like one and the characters are there just to tease Araragi.
4Nice quadsYou don't think a schoolgirl forcefully stripping someone of the opposite gender is not a little much by itself?
Monkey will never finger you
1stop ruining my life anon.
8This is a really hard list to make because so many of the characters are Koyomisexual.Cat hasn't shown any romantic interest in anyone outside of Araragi, and she says to Kaiki that "she has good taste in men."Snake has relied on Koyomi to not have to worry about anyone else for like 6 years.Crab said she would have fallen in love with anyone who saved her, but saving her isn't that easy and she was pretty hard to approach.Monkey doesn't like men other than RRRG.For Bird and Bee you need to live up to their Onii-chan standard. in the translated Owari excerpt that some anon posted a few weeks ago, Bird recalls going out with her boyfriend because, after she rejects him, he says "if you use your onii-chan as an excuse that's not very convincing.The circumstances for ever meeting Doll and Snail are pretty difficult to achieve.
6Because we watch it for the banter, not for cartoon sex. It's Banter: The Anime.
0do you even hear yourself?how is that not what you want
4Monkey doesn't have the ovaries to actually perform a sex act on another person. You saw how timid she got when Numachi grabbed her boob and when she almost kissed her.She's openly perverted but actually innocent when it comes down to it. Pretty much the opposite of Crab who seems normal at first but is actually a massive pervert who has no problem getting lewd.
9You consider their idiotic conversations banter?
1Well that's the thing, that's farther than he ever went with snail.
4Well sure I'd want that anon but that's a tad unrealistic don't you think?
4God I'm such a baka, not like I want to not fuck you or anything big brother...The way she falls over herself like a slut apprentice is just adorable.
5She wasn't attracted to Numachi until she found out she was a ghost though.I mean if someone you didnt find attractive was feeling you up, wouldnt you be nervous
2I dunno man.He does lick a lot of places.
4In a show with vampires, undead, ghosts, demon arms, gods and phoenixes I think its allowed to take a step in the unrealistic direction Also since she reads a bunch of BL I would think to prove her lewdness she would want to do something super lewd to RRRG
5Basically this. Monkey is really good at playing the role she set up for herself: the perverted, genki kouhai. But at the end of the day, that's not her identity and she won't be able to follow through if anything got serious. We see how lost she gets when her sempais take off.
5THIS son. Hitagi a diamond in the rough. Kanbaru a watermelon.
4Hitagi a diamond in the roughShit eater
64read3
9Yeah but those are realistic within the Monogatari universe.Monkey getting legitimately frisky with Araragi is not.
6Her grandma walking in on her and the shame she felt also makes you think she's putting on a show.
Normally I would just search the archives for this, but since it's down maybe a kind anon can help me out. Im trying to watch the Monogatari Second Series and have the first 6 BDs from Commie. I know there a 26 or so episodes with a few recaps, but the BDs only go up to 13. Do I just have to get each individual episode after that because they never did the rest of the BDs? Or did I fuck up my torrents somewhere? Sorry for this.
39But that's the thing, all he does with snail is grope her and try to, unsuccessfully, take off her panties. Kanbaru just succeeds where he fails.
3openly being lewd infront of your grannyAnyone with respect would feel embarrassed
2that was uncalled for.
I had sex with you're waifu. How do you feel about it.
3but being lewd is all about having a sexual desireyou dont normally have that sort of thing toward your grandmother
I just realized that most likely the main reason why Monkey acts so perverted is because she's trying to impress/imitate Crab and then by extension Araragi.
1feels like my dick in your ass anon.
3I did and I think the other points are much stronger. Plus, she at least partially wanted to be kissed by Numachi when she was coming on to her before she found out she was a ghost.
2I think someone said monkey learned all her lewdness from crab in the LNs
9I think he means a show while on the phone with raragi?
90Whatever...
9Might have been in the LNs, but I know for a fact it was in one of the character commentaries.
5she backed away from her during the first basketball sceneand then after she passed on in the second basketball thing she realized that she was cute and should have kissed her when she had the chance
4I wish monkey got her kiss. I just wanted her to be happy in her own arc.
53And to add to that, you can see that most of the perversity in her relationship with Araragi has dissolved with their sempai-kouhai relationship. She gets embarrassed by Araragi showing up while she's naked, she basically only talks to him about serious things even after the conflict has ended, and she's taken aback by his claims about his relationship with Karen instead of trying to one-up him on being a pervert.
3monkey being happy everat least she gets mounted by bat in owari
3Right?4Obviously she was thrown off during the first basketball scene. But if you look at the body language it's not 'eww, I need to get away.' It's more like a mix of being scared and being tempted. She doesn't even attempt to push her away when their faces are like 5 cm apart.
3Monkey is Tantalus anon.
1She has accepted defeat. She doesn't even have siblings she can fuck in order to compete.
1I like the idea that she gets less perverse as the series goes on. Probably from being around Araragi's sisters and needing to be a bro
638Really, monkey can never win at anything.
3I want to kiss Monkey.
7Well Araragi certainly doesn't fill that role.
7Probably because she grows up and matures. But I don't like that excuse.
7She doesn't get less perverse. Araragi just raises the standards for "perverse" so god-damn high and in such a quick amount of time that it's impossible for anyone to keep up.
9Cute together.56This. Kanbaru is just mellow person when someone more alpha is around her, like Numachi, Hitagi and college Araragi. Her attitude is different towards high school Araragi and college Araragi
