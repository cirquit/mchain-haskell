Why was Jesus' sacrifice necessary to forgive us all? Why wasn't it enough for God to just forgive us? He is all powerful, after all.
God is perfectly just and sin requires death. God suffered that death Himself so that those who believe in Christ need not suffer it.
Expecting logic or coherence from the bible. 2015CE
Because yet again the Jews couldn't wouldn't uphold God's law. Jesus Christ made the faith much simpler and easier to obay for everyone.
Sin isn't just about violating God's law or whatever. It is a state of separation from the divine. God has to immerse himself in that separation by plunging into the wages of sin pain, death and hell in order to give us something to grab onto. The only other way he could get us out would be to force us out of sin, which can only happen through love--but forced love is not actually love, so that doesn't work.http://archive.episcopalchurch.org/109399_14480_ENG_HTM.htmEternal death in our rejection of God BCP, p. 862. This state or place of separation from God is closely related to the concept of human free will. We may choose to accept or reject God. We will not be forced by God to receive God's love. Hell is a permanent state of separation from God that can be freely chosen, not God's angry punishment for misdeeds.
The only thing he did was make it less Islam-esque. Lol!
because Christianity is fucking retarded
Why was Jesus' sacrifice necessary to forgive us all?if you study mythology it's a common theme within many cultures. the christfags just did what they always do and incorporated it into their religion, because they're like IRL Borg. Then philosophers and theologists actually tried to make sense of it because it was their job and so we ended up with far fetched explanations about it, like with most christian concepts, even the ones that aren't necessarily coming from other religions.
All Christians should martyr themselves, die so we can finally be rid of your silliness
He's forgiving us for killing his son. This is culturally relevant because up until that point, the gods forgiving such a terrible crime was unheard of. It marked the beginning of a movement towards mercy rather than vengeance.
What about islam bro?
That too.
Because someone called Jesus got executed by the Romans and his followers had to come up with some excuse as to why that happened to their chosen guy.
christianity mercifulMost christians support the death penalty and carried out thousands of massacres throughout historyWhatever god did didn't really work out.
tip
which can only happen through love--but forced love is not actually love, so that doesn't work.Exactly this.
who cares, religion is a memeit should not be taken seriously
they have lots of excuses for all of that though so no sweat
OP asks christians a questionatheists feel like their opinion is welcomefucking atheists
who are you quoting?
God is a hypocrite, and a fiend. Christ's sacrifice is worthless unless acknowledged that it was necessary, and no logical man would ever accept being judged for sins by an entity that created free will and was either too ignorant, too blind, too depraved, or too stupid to anticipate that people would sin. Ultimately, sin is God's own fault, and a deity that shortsighted isn't worthy of worship.
Think about it, If God just forgave us nothing would change. You'd think humanity would be like, 'Ok thanks man lol we'll now respect you forever'Jesus sent a message that he was willing to go that far for his faith. Even if you don't believe its not hard to understand

You know nothing about the gospel, so why post ? Your "opinion" is worthless and founded on emotion and social determinism alone.
how did things change?
shut up
You know nothing about what I know.
I know that you will GO TO HELL FOR ETERNITY if you don't accept that I'm right and you're wrong
I don't see why god thinks its up to us to be forgiven of our sins when he's the one constantly sending plagues and floods etc to fuck our shit up
Prove me wrong by demonstrating your advanced knowledge of the christian gospel.
You have 30 seconds to explain the trinity without committing a heresy.
It's not complicated at all
It is a deliberate echo of the sacrificial lamb mentioned earlier in the bible and continuing the many shepherding metaphors.Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?God knows that it is only suicide that makes people notice. He's a histrionic faggot making a point.
makes assertionsothers have to prove assertion wrongSure is average christian in here.Later, tell me how things have changed first.
The only way to be spared eternal damnation was to live life according to God's law. Unfortunately, man is prone to sin and thus cannot fulfill it. So He became flesh and died an innocent man, fulfilling His law so that we could all be forgiven.God couldn't simply forgive us without that sacrifice. What point would there be in obeying His laws and commandments if one was never punished for breaking them?
I'm 14 and I've just discovered Pascal
It shows, your reasoning sounds like his shitty wager. Actually I don't know how christians aren't offended at pascal's wager. I guess they'll turn a blind eye to anyone who seemingly helps their cause.
Honestly I don't know, I was simply explaining that it wasn't hard to understand why Jesus did what he did to the OP.But to try to answer your question, I guess that more people follow Christianity now? He opened up a lot of peoples eyes. I'm not Christian btw, I just can understand it
He rose and stood tottering in that cold autistic dark with his arms outheld for balance while the vestibular calculations in his skull cranked out their reckonings. An old chronicle. To seek out the upright. No fall but preceded by a declination. He took great marching steps into the nothingness, counting them against his return. Eyes closed, arms oaring. Upright to what? Something nameless in the night, lode or matrix. To which he and the stars were common satellite. Like the great pendulum in its rotunda scribing through the long day movements of the universe of which you may say it knows nothing and yet know it must.
John Green never fails to deliver the terrible prose lol
in that cold autistic darkDude, it's so dark in here it's fuckin retarded!
This is from The Road
I remember in his AMA he said he loves YA because he can write about human existence without "having to layer it with irony." Ironic, because his prose is empty and while it sounds so advanced and intricate, it's a whole frivolous nothing: Watteau for teenage hearts.
this guy writes so bad i can't even figure out what he means

capitalism has many faults and a return to spirituality would be a good thing in a mechanized, soulless amoral world.don't see what there is to disagree with him about tbh. when he's done with his marxist phase, as it is impossible to be an idealist for life, he will be the next offshoot of evola, detailing the madness of the kali yuga.
and a return to spirituality would be a good thing in a mechanized, soulless amoral world.It is, if the point is to make people satisfied with their condition of agents of a mechanized, soulless, amoral world.There's a reason why when societies reach maturity "schools of life" start replacing their "schools of thought"
implying capitalism *sniff* is not *sniff* much more *sniff* spiritual *sniff* than any *sniff* form of religion

My biggest problem with Brand is that he hsells this idea that revolution and left-wing struggle is this cool sexy thing, which I only wish I could believe in, because when you actually get to know the Left and its history you realise how, from the outside, it's probably one of the least appealing political enterprises in existence. This is more or less why I've learned to appreciate Chris Hedges a lot with experience: the way he seems completely dead inside is a lot more consistent with the way I feel when I realise I have to force my way through yet another grad student's philosophy paper or another economic history book filled with comparative data about the welfare systems of Germany and Portugal in the 50's.
how the fuck does anyone actually think thisBrand is one of those cunts who yells people down, assuming that they don't have a point without ever actually listening to them. He'd be an awful PM.
Unless of course we consider that the concept of property is preposterous, like a Native American chief, Great Elk or one of them, who when us lot By “us” I suppose I mean white Europeans. You might not be one; I hope you’re not, actually. Sorry for unconsciously addressing this book to imperialistsGandhi, an extremely efficient revolutionary, is perhaps most admired for his excellent deployment of “nonviolent protest.” The ingenuity of nonviolence is not immediately obvious to us, the inheritors of a world built upon martial means, but the principle is almost like mathematics. Authorities are trained to deal with a particular kind of conflict, violent conflict, so by using violent means you are entering the territory that they are best qualified to control. Also, by becoming violent you are tuning in to the frequency that you are trying to overcome, the frequency of violation, violence FM.“Be the change you wish to see in the world,” said Gandhi. If you want a nonviolent world, you cannot use violence to achieve it.Human beings, who want the best for their families. David Cameron said, in a rare foray into compassion, “Hug a hoodie.” He was right—we should. We should also cuddle a copper. Was that a bit “Yeah, man,” a bit reductive? It will be: The solution will not be rarefied, the Revolution will be televised, and it will be easy and based on simple things, like interconnectivity and union. Or love.In fact, I must mention that I was interviewed by the police during the writing of this book, and the WPC who questioned me was so resolutely lovely, judicious, and kind, I nearly gave up on the whole revolutionary caper. There were cups of tea and codes of conduct and tales of public marches in her former life. In fact, though, this just confirms my thesis that people are beautiful and Revolution inevitable. We don’t need to grow compassion in a petri dish; everyone’s fine—we just have to scrape away a few repellent systems.
He'd be better than Cameron and blair mate. I think he needs to flesh out his ideas some but he's got a basic grasp on political philophy and he's read capital by thomas pikkity so I think he could help take us in the right direction.
He'd be better than Cameron and BlairFucking empty headed actor on his ivory tower with his useless platitudes would be better?Worm.

He realised a violent revolution would not be as efficient as a peaceful one. A peaceful one would also receive an international recognition.

The type of person that when shit gets real condemns a lot of actions of people who actually need shit to change.Haven't read, so it's not like my opinion means anything. But I think I'll pass it, thx :
Brand is an insufferable cunt. All he does is string political buzzwords together with made up intellectual sounding words in between them.
newspapers*has ever*damn I'm sleepy sry
Russell Brand would be the first one to hide or pay for protection if a revolution broke out. Or maybe he'd just move abroad.
If you don't need more reasons why Russell is a fucking idiot. He did a interview with Owen Lewis for the guardian.
empty headedHe's actually quite intelligent and lucidly spoken, my friend. Not sure how you judge smarts.
he really suggests no alternative to the current world. he suggests alternative ideas but ideas are just cots in the machine, if he wants a revolution he needs to reinvent a better machine, which he failed to do in this book. It details ways that the current world can be improved like with the section on food production and his criticism of captitalism but he suggests no way to safely impliment these without the current economy or system crumbling. In theory this book would work buthe needs to work out a better implementation before it can be taken serious.
I judge "smarts" on the quality of ideas produced not on being "intelligent and lucidly spoken"
He is far smarter than people give him credit for, and the way people judged his book/statements as if it was supposed to be a serious work of political philosophy is ridiculous.His points are actually very simple, but nonetheless worth making.I also can't stand the crushing irony of people in the media and politicians laughing at him for not talking or acting like those normally involved in politics, when a big part of what russell brand is getting at is the closed club Oxbridge-yness of politics which doesn't allow for any dissenting voices, and is deeply deeply conformist.
OP, read the book properly. If you genuinely want to discuss the book; ask a particular question, make a particular point, give /lit/ something to work with. Don't try and steal others interpretations of it under the guise of a discussion. Which, I could be wrong in suggesting, but as your not really engaging with Brands ideas - and merely making quick comments, it's seem like that may be what your doing here.
ok
not at all actually

No.
If you want a nonviolent world, you cannot use violence to achieve it.Idk m8, it's worked all throughout history. See Roman Empire, American Civil War, World War 2, etc. etc. What do those things have to do with nonviolence? None of them made the world more peaceful. War still happens.
He has some good ideas though, read his book. The crux is that we need a fairer wealth redistribution mechanism and a return to mythology/spirituality, two things that capitalism has robbed us of.
Capitalism has robbed far less spirituality than leftists dogs
fairer wealth redistribution mechanismHow about abolishing the money-form altogether?
Nah m8, leftism is a product of capitalism, so all that stuff? Capitalism's fault.
fairer wealth redistribution mechanismBANKERS THE BONUSANKERS
No capitalism fosters the growth of the human spirit
Hey, strawman and reductio ad absurdium all you like, doesn't change the fact that the world's wealth is heavily unevenly distributed. The top 1% controls a disproportionate amount of wealth. A politician like Brand could change that
The crux is that we need a fairer wealth redistribution mechanism and a return to mythology/spiritualityHitler believed the same thing.
Hurr durr lets distribute more wealth and be like totally spiritual manEmpty headed
That's a longer term goal; socialism is the path to it
Because Brand is the only person to have noticed that, right? Lmao. Read some proper Marxist literature, mate.
This, he's rehashing the same old ideas that any fucking Western college student could tell you about
Irrevelant leftist who knows nothing about how the world works and changes his mind faster than a politician lies.
Hey, Marxists these days have crawled into the woodwork a bit. I think they're still licking their wounds following the collapse of the USSR. Plus they are seen as too dull and bland and associated with authoritarianism. What we need is a new rEVOLution like the one Brand talks about ;
reblogged
No, socialism i.e. "social democracy" is merely a pressure valve for capitalism.
He's a pretension 'bourgeois liberal" wanker.off to the gulag
I don't think so, in places like Cuba the regime openly identified as socialist and stated it was a stepping stone to communism. So describing it as a pressure valve for capitalism doesn't make sense. Be sarcastic as you want, we know where we want to take this. We can enact change without relying on theories formulated by some crusty old austrian dude
Alright, you know how these companies and 1% got rich?The 99% bought and used their goods and services.

Bravo.I have never see someone miss the point this hard.Way to miss the point.
Shouting FALLACY without actually responding is a fallacy within itself. Or are you going to whitewash over that too, since you obviously don't want to consider responding?
The problem is that Brand never provides concrete solutions to these problems. He vaguely defines problems which everybody is already aware of instead of saying 'Here are my very specific and defined solutions to these problems".
In the case of Cuba it is a pressure valve for authoritarianism. It's a reluctant compromise designed to declaw radical politics; a futile attempt at buttressing power structures that will inevitably be washed away by the tide of history.
Who cares about being crusty or oldOh wait you just follow the celebrity of the week like a sheep
Read more Heidegger, fascist
Alright, you know how these companies and 1% got rich?The 99% bought and used their goods and services.It's so simple! That isn't even analysis. It's a truism that doesn't take into account everything that produces value.
Russel Brand is what happens when a complete idiot develops strong verbal skills.
He's a good talker but his writing is laughably bad.
REMINDER that marxism is a past theory which we must discard to make headway. STOP living in the past.
No, I take your point that I'm simplifying it.But my point was that the 1% would not have been able to become the 1% without the assistance of the 99%.No he's a horrible speaker.He makes his language archaic and complex to give the idea that there's fully fluffed thought supporting it.Exactly the same way those atheist fedora quotes are just utter try-hard nonsense.
No he's a horrible speaker.Not when he's being funny.
I wasn't talking about his comedy specifically.But when he's trying to make serious political commentary he comes across as someone who has just swallowed a dictionary and tries to use complex words and phrasing for the sake of coming across as intellectual.
Brand is just a celebrity mouthpiece for the typical all-ideals-no-solutions leftist. He is not a politician, he is not a philosopher, and nothing in this book is particularly revolutionary in thought. I personally tend to agree with him but, unfortunately, his ideals do not apply to the real world. As far as the British economy, Capitalism is far too ingrained in society for a Communist system based on compassion to ever be successfully implemented. On the other hand, his moral ideology is actually a hindrance to equality in that, in forming the basis for most of his arguments, it distracts from the problems that actually affect the welfare of the population. For example, the EU is a neo-liberal playground that serves businessmen and bankers over the well being of the general populace, but demented leftists overlook this in favour of touting 'peace and co-operation'. Brand himself rejects any argument against mass immigration because he favours the wonderful ideas of 'tolerance and charity' over recognition of the destructive effects of overpopulation and the inevitable strain between incompatible cultures within communities. As a self-identifying socialist, I would love his ideas to be applicable and relevant, but that's simply not the case. He's written a bible for left-wing idealists which, rather depressingly, is about as relevant to the real word as the Holy Bible taken literally.
Capitalism was a definitive improvement over spirituality. Soullessness is the opposite of amorality.
You are *incredibly* dumb
He makes his language archaic and complex to give the idea that there's fully fluffed thought supporting it.Exactly the same way those atheist fedora quotes are just utter try-hard nonsense.You may think is his style is stupid and I'd agree with you, but you are not his intended audience and the results he's getting show that he's certainly a good speaker.
no u
Good for him.
I don't care what he's going to say if he's not going to put forward some sort of outline of a policy proposal.If he's not name-dropping Frederick Soddy, C.H. Douglas, Gottfried Feder, Irving Fisher, etc. I don't give a shit about what is basically glorified complaining.
Mandela realised the same.Mandela wasn't a non-violent revolutionary, he was the leader of an extremely violent revolutionary force that did ritualised torture, executions and bombs for publicity.You'd know this if you ever read anything about south Africa and apartheid so the fact that you're saying it means that you just assumed that it is the case that Nelson Mandela was the leader of a peaceful protest movement like Ghandi was simply because you hear their names mentioned together so often.
Fairly well said.Yep, but a great deal of time has passed since gandhi did his last protest. the police is prepared now, and even if they aren't it doesn't matter at all, they have provocateurs among the lines of every single authorized protest.I'm not particularly keen of violent protests but I hear so much bitching in my country everytime some protesters allegedly go apeshit that it makes me wanna puke.This is just dumb rhetoric and the fact that it fucking works on everyone genuinely makes me mad.
Spirituality and capitalism is both very general terms. I bet he wants people to love more too

i'm surprised to see john marco on the fantasy charthe's the first fantasy author i really likedwhat's the castle in the clouds supposed to mean?
Cosmerefag reporting in, happy for an excuse to sperg about the Cosmere.
I'm new to this board so sorry for probably beating a dead horse .Are Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy a good read? Or are they just entry level garbage for dumb-dumb's?Also recommend some essential entry level books that aren't garbage. I got really into reading about a year ago and i don't really know where to go next.
About to pick up Dune. I tried reading it a while ago, but didn't make it past page 100. I'm going to give it another chance.As far as what I've read so far:American Gods - Neil GaimanIt was all right. It really picked up toward the end. I found the main character kind of flat. I know that's how he is supposed to be, but still. I will probably read Gaiman again in the future.Lucifer's Hammer - NivenProbably the best post-apocalyptic novel as far as realism goes in terms of the science and what would might actually happen if a comet hit us. Not as convoluted and literary as The Road, which I liked. It is a bit dated since it was written in the 70s.The Wise Man's Fear, Patrick RothfussOkay. Not as tightly plotted as the first book.The Dragon Reborn - Robert JordanI like Jordan, especially for his world-building. I don't think the third novel is as good as the first two. From what I've read, it goes downhill until Sanderson picks up the story. It's still good, just a lot more words with less happening.Several Star Wars books authored by Drew Karphyshyn.Fun reads if you like the Star Wars universe.
Definitely not entry level garbage.Not everyone likes Tolkien, but his world building is second to none. I'm glad to have read these before the movies came out. It's the quintessential quest plot line, and most if not all modern fantasy is influenced by it in some way. It's a must read, even for non-fantasy readers.
Oh, forgot to add another.The Book of Strange New ThingsI enjoyed this one. A literary first contact story. Some things are left unexplained, but it's still a good read.
what's the castle in the clouds supposed to mean?You'd have to read Wolfe's "Wizard Knight" to find out.
Lord of the Rings is kind of important to the genre because it sets the tone for everything.It's got a detailed world, mythological characters, and defines a lot of fantasy concepts that influenced pretty much everyone.That's the surface level stuff, but it's a good read from a literary perspective because of how it's been interpreted. Tolkien's fantasy wasn't just straight up fantasy, it was deeply-laced with commentary on his values, beliefs and how he saw the world and spirituality. There's plenty of allegory and symbolism in it, to the point where people who treat LOTR as just the baseline for fantasy See: Peter Jackson are missing much of the point.On the other hand it's very long, very wordy, and often very slow. Compared to the Hobbit which is a much more accessible book with more relatable characters, LOTR I think has a lot of trouble breaking free of the mythological aura to show the cast as real individuals.But then that's also important to understanding the genre too, because that part of LOTR has become detrimental to a lot of books who tried to ape it.I don't know if I'd say start with it, but I think it's good to read it at some point because it's key in understanding how the genre is the way it is.
What SF/F books are you currently readingThe Way of Kings, Brandon Sanderson Recent purchases?Assassins Apprentice, Robin HobbUpcoming releases you're excited for?ASOIAF continuing pleb I know
Read The Hobbit. Then read other stuff until you get the urge to return to that world. Then read Lord of the Rings.But yes, it's definitely worth reading.
This is pleb-y as fuck, but what's some good sci-fi or fantasy with a cast of characters who interact, and at LEAST one or two waifu-able female characters who are cool and interesting and are present in the book or series a lot?
actually that was why i was asking, because wolfe has used it before in both the wizard knight and castleview, and i'm not all that sure what the imagery originally meant
And New Sun. I'm a Wolfe scholar and I don't even know. Please other anon, do tell.
The Book of the Long SunI would follow General Mint in battle.
Firefly.
Yeah you're right, dunno how that slipped my mindThere might be some significance in Severian thinking he sees a castle in the sky, even though it actually isn't one. Haven't really thought of that before.
Same anon, I figure its a symbol of hope, Heaven or paradise.
I agree.

In this order:Lord Dunsany, William Morrison, Robert E. Howard, Lovecraft, Jorge Luis Borges, Tolkien, Philip K. Dick, Ursula K. le Guin, Isaac Asimov, Frank Herbert, Terry Pratchett, Douglas Adams, full stop. That should get you started and, hopefully, finished. Because everything out there rips these guys off.

Marc? Btw Marc Aramini is going to publish a two volume book on Wolfe. I'll try to buy it.
I've just started the Book of the New Sun. I honestly didn't think it was going to do anyhting for me but holy shit. I actually cried of joy at some descriptions and phrases. It's just so beautiful and uncanny and Borgesian at moments.

Book of the New Sun isn't Arthurian at all. The Wizard Knight on the other hand is really neat and too subtitle for its own good. Also why are sf threads the only good ones on lit? All these wanabee patricians and I'm only discussing literature here.
but holy shitwe've got another one
Is the Wizard Knight worth it? It's because people here actually enjoy what they read and the act of reading probably.
the cutest science fiction author ever?
yeah

pick up random nautical-themed fantasy noveldon't even look at the author, it's in a secondhand store and the blurb is interesting enoughread itsort of enjoy itthere's two sequelsread themget so fucking mad at the fucking ending and the fucking asshole authorlook at the authorit's Kevin J. AndersonServes me right. In summation the Terra Incognita Trilogy is shite and probably the worst fantasy novel series I've ever read, not simply because it's bad but because it took my interest and choked it to death and pissed on its' corpse.
And yeah, it's a really solid book. It's grown on me in retrospect a lot.
only looks at the author's name on the books after finishing three of themI don't believe you.
No really, it was like a four-month long brainfart. My brain just didn't connect this Kevin J Anderson with "that" Kevin J Anderson. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks.
Possible.Most of his SF was
a friend of mine recommended me Lyonesse, i have a shit ton of things to read already, is it worth it?
Replace Kingkiller Chronicles with something good like Gormenghast or Book of the new sun or the Swords series by Fritz Leiber
I've only read the first one but it's pretty good. I like Vance's unique style.
I'm trying to write a science fiction novel but I'm already stuck on what to do for the first sentence. I'm also stuck on if I should use first person or third person omniscient narrative.
If you've never written before avoid first person like the plague. You don't have a sense of balance yet so it'll either be full of I's or go off on way too many tangents. Third person is easier, just make sure the perspective is anchored on whatever character you're focusing on, so that way you don't float off into space and end up getting too infodump-heavy.As to the first sentence, just don't worry about it and come back later. Your first draft is rough for a reason, you'll learn more about writing as you go and you can always come back and apply that knowledge to stuff you wrote earlier. tl;dr don't worry about getting any one sentence or paragraph just right, your goal right now should just be to write out the entire book and fiddle with it once you're done.
Sorry I explained my situation wrong. I dont know if I want to useAs the impact sirens blared, Olivia removed the duffel bag from underneath her bed. or Olivia removed the duffel bag from underneath her bed as the impact sirens blared.for the first sentence.
Second one's better, sounds more definite. As is kind of a wishy-washy word and sometimes people overuse it.
Thanks. I'm probably going to show up more about the wording of my sentences and shit.
Good luck with your second sentence.
It's cool, there's no such thing as a stupid question.
What about this one?
Deep.
Where did you read that Wheel of Time gets worse after TDR? Just curious because I have never seen that opinion before.
I'm working on a space opera thing. I have this idea for a mad scientist type figure. Think futuristic Frankenstein. What do you think of the idea of having him just out floating alone in some solar-powered ship manned entirely by computers where all he does is set the course then go do his mad science?The basic idea is that he's working on a specific thing that's in violation of interplanetary law and also the mores of his day, and doesn't want to be bothered while he works.
Scratch that, I'm retarded
He'll need characters to play off against.
The Lady of the Lake gives Severian his sword.
Philip K Dick is shit, Frank Herbert has only one book actually worth reading, Terry Pratchett is shit, and so is Douglas Adams.
what one book is that?
Unless I'm forgetting something, no she doesn't. There isn't even a Lady of the Lake in the text. What happens with Terminus Est is a reversal of the Arthurian Lady in the Lake scenario.
Dune. Though God Emperor of Dune has its moments that make it somewhat worthwhile.
The Lady of the Lake gives Severian his sword.The Lady is an impotent old man who tortures people for a living.
Any love for John Wyndham here?
of course, gotta love the day of the triffids, that book probably got me started on reading
There are lots of blogs and recommendations on books or series for fans of "Game of Thrones", but what I'm really after is books that are similar in depth of character / character development. I don't really care if it's scifi or not, but I've checked out all of the common recommendations and none of them really fit the bill. I'm not looking for "epic fantasy" or "gritty setting" or "historical basis" or any of that stuff, I'm just looking for stories with deep, well-written characters interacting with each other. In that context, does anyone have some perhaps off-the-beaten path plugs I could check out?
It always annoys me how people refer to 28 Days Later and The Walking Dead ripping the beginning off each other when they more than likely both got the idea from Day of the Triffids.
i never really realized that, but they really do steal it straight from the day of the triffids, with the hospital after an injury and everything
In most legends Arther gets the sword from the stone, before losing it in the lake and the Lady returns it to him.
No IIRC he tries to fight the black knight but the black knight breaks his sword and merlin saves his life and he brings him to the lady of the lake to get a new one. Also the scabbard for the new sword saves his blood or something.
A swallow carrying a coconut?
He gets them eventually. Early on he's all alone, and that itself provides some of the conflict, but his situation changes quite a few times.
He didn't get it from the stone and it wasn't returned.
I need a word to replace 'put on' At the top floor, she put on the hazmat respirator...I just don't like the way it sounds and I've also tried slipped on, adorned, donned, and harnessed but none appease me. inb4 just go back to it later It bothers my ocd/perfectionism to much to continue
don, she donned the hazmat respirator
At the top floor, she donned the hazmat respirator from her duffel bag and exited the cargo lift.I guess it will have to do but something still bothers me in the sentence.
I don't like "At the top floor", although I am reading this sentence alone and it might fit better in a paragraph. Just a thought.
She donned the hazmat respirator from her duffel bag and exited the cargo lift as it reached the top floor.Would this work or should I replace 'as' with 'when'?
That reads much better. It really is going to take you eons to finish this book if you keep up this level of scrutiny on the first draft.
first draftI'm one those of those guys that edits his essays while writing them to avoid multiple drafts. I'll probably write it by hand first, type it up to check for any spelling or grammatical errors, make certain scenes more descriptive if needed, then be done with it.
The longer the piece, the less viable that is. For a book, it's just not doable. Unless you're doing something frenetic like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, it just won't happen. And even then, Thompson had been writing for a very long time, and as hard as it may be for some to believe, took writing very seriously and worked his ass off at it.
Well even without Day of the Triffids its an effective way to start that type of story off.
/lit/ has a general nowIt's over, next, we'll have general threads for every branch of philosophy, heck, while you're at it why not make a religion general since we hate talking about that so much too.If you feel bad about your tastes being bullied by anonymous virgins on a siamese stamp trading forum then I suggest you go elsewhere, because this place is not for you.The worst part is that this won't solve the issue at hand, people will still pollute the board with pointless threads and all that will come of it is to create a hugbox within which you can discuss the same topics over and over again with the same likeminded autists day in day out.
It's over, next, we'll have general threads for every branch of philosophy, heck, while you're at it why not make a religion general since we hate talking about that so much too.They have been a thing for a while now newfag.
What is it with you people and this irrational dislike of generals.There is nothing wrong with them.
Yet they never stick, because /lit/ isn't that kind of board. If you want to circlejerk and samefag your same 4 crappy recommendations ad infinum then take it /out/sideThere's nothing irrational about it, any interesting points have already been discussed in previous threads, recreating the same thread with a different picture won't change that.Not to mention the entire notion attracts denizen's of a certain straight edge website that I won't dare mention in fear of tussling some sanders.
Just hide the thread, nerd
open fantasy novelit has a mapINTO THE TRASH

I'm I the only one who can't read the chart because it's fucking 200x471?
The show has more, and less fun, rape than the books.
I like maps though. They're neat.
currently readingHyperion. Literally just stated.what books have you read this year?I am Legend, The Forever War. And a few other books that aren't sci-fi.I liked I am Legend, though I wish it had been longer. And that ending, I don't know how I feel about it. It was cool to have it end with the book title, but ... yeah.I didn't like the constant focus on homosexuality in The Forever War or the way everything gets resolved in the end just because. Like, he doesn't even give an explanation, he just says it's beyond our ability to understand. Everything else was good though.
i love how he became the vampire of the vampires
Upon reaching the top floor...
Hey guys, I don't really browse /lit/ much, but I'm looking for some fantasy books to read - preferably with a focus on magic.While your opinions of Eragon may be less than positive, I enjoyed the time Paolini spent on developing the magic system used in the books, as well as creating the vastly different cultures of the various races in the books.Any recommendations?
I like Moorcock, but he is a massively bitter cunt whose opinion should be taken with a mountain of salt, especially since 80% of his output is trash written for the money.With regard to The Forever War, I feel like a lot of sci-fi does that when it goes into "big idea" mode.
mfw read a fantasy series where the author was also a cartographermade his own mapsThat was really fucking cool and a nice surprise.Don't read past Hyperion.
What's a good order to read them in? Just go by publication order?
I'm about 50 pages from finishing pic related. Should I move onto Deadhouse Gates, or Night of the Knives? Should I just read all of Erikson's books before Esslemont's? Is there a solid reading order?
I just started reading BlindsightStarting your book with a Ted Bundy quoteHmm...
Fuck literature.
I'll never understand why people are against generals. You get one thread to ignore/hide on a topic you don't care for instead of 20, or conversely you only have to pay attention to one thread instead of 20 on a topic you do care for, what's the negative?
In theory I would agree with you but go to /tv/ or /mu/ and read the general threads there, it's like a super concentrated cancer. People probably worry that general threads are the beginnings of /lit/s transformation into /mu/ or /tv/
I haven't read any of his work but Brandon Sanderson is super autistic about his magic from what I've heard.
What's the name of a two-pronged spear? pic related
A three pronged spear is called a trident, so I'd guess a bident would be accurate.
Turns out my guess was right:"A bident is a two-pronged implement resembling a pitchfork. In classical mythology, the bident is associated with Pluto, the ruler of the underworld, while the three-pronged trident is the implement of Poseidon Neptune, ruler of the sea and of earthquakes.EtymologyThe word 'bident' was brought into the English language before 1914,[1] and is derived from the Latin bidentis, meaning "having two prongs".[2]"
bidentWhat an ugly sounding word. But that's not the droid I'm looking for. It's on the tip of my tongue.
Theyre very Shakespearean, with heavy doses of Poe. Not very fantasy aside from the impossibly huge castle setting, the ability to control animals, and something else thats a spoiler. The author was a painter by trade. So prepare for a guy that 'paints' scenes and characters with prose. Very descriptive & beautiful. Also has gothic influences like Dracula/Phantom of the opera. I think a gene wolfe fan would enjoy the nuances of the plot. A GRRM fan would enjoy the intrigue between characters. Also I swear Rowling ripped off Peake.1st two books are essential, third book is very skippable due to Peakes mind detoriating early in the writing process and eventually dying. For an ending read the separate short story Boy in Darkness.Its a tragedy, with themes of Anarchy vs. Tradition.
The lance of Longinus?
Dresden Files? First couple of books are pretty crappygets better, but the underlying magic systems are interesting and reasonably consistent.
But he started it with Gourevitch and Hemingway quotes?I like his chapter quote selection.that Æon Flux quote out of nowhere
Guys, can I get some feedback on this piece of Sci-Fi?I've only written the first chapter.http://pastebin.com/HGGBzyMd

Also has gothic influences like Dracula/Phantom of the opera.I read this much of your post without seeing the context of the thread and somehow guessed you were talking about Peake without having read his work or even knowing anything about him.
I really quite enjoyed it. Not much of a critique but I'd definitely want to keep reading.If this were a short story at the end Gira would find out he'd been in the rift the whole time.
Oh I forgot to actually explain the plot part of "what its about" lolFollowing a daily system of meaningless, complicated rituals is the "religion" of the people of Gormenghast. Soon Steerpike does a Rash Thing that causes a big paradigm shift in usual way of life in the Castle and the forces of change come to Gormenghast for the first time in centuries and sets the boy on a path of lost innocence. The protagonists:young & troubled Steerpike the cooking servant, who uses opportunity, his acrobatic eavesdropping skills, and his wit to rise quickly through the ranks.Titus, heir to the throne, who like Steerpike is adventurous & rebellious even in the first book when he's still an infant although in a less selfish/malevolent way. Doesn't really care for his inheritance as much as the concept of freedom from rules and boredom. The books strengths are definitely characterization and atmosphere. Muh prose fags will adore this shit. Some extremely memorable scenes too.I rank it to be on equal ground with Lord of the Rings and Book of the New Sun.
Sadly I have more artistic integrity than to leave it there and make a tweest ending.Thanks for the positive thoughts anyway, as long as I can write something someone wants to read...I'm happy.
Steerpike REALLY reminded me of Lucifer from Paradise Lost. Favorite character hands down was Mr. Flay and his cracking knees.
It puts me in mind of Neuromancer and the like.
If I got published and someone referred to me as "This generation's William Gibson", I'd be beyond happy with that.
Good luck with it. Hopefully someone who actually studies writing can give you a better critique than I can.
Is it bad that I imagine Ardee looking like Remy Lacroix?
How do you guys feel about purposefully incorrect science in your science fiction? The story I'm working on is full of nonsensical technobabble that in no way tries to sound like plausible future science in the way something like Star Trek would do.For example, in one part the MC is having a space duel with the villain, the space pirate Rocketlegs, who has solid gold rocket boosters for legs. For most of the duel, the MC is just circling around Rocketlegs and keeping a distance. In the end we discover that the MC has been placing tiny machines in the space around them, and when he's finished they form a force field around them, and fill the enclosed space with oxygen. Then the MC turns on a powerful magnet in his rocketcycle, which, now that there's oxygen to carry the magnetic waves, pull Rocketlegs' rocket legs away from his body, leaving his adrift and easy to capture.
It doesn't matter as long as the comedy is good.
It wouldn't bother me that much, but surely you can just make up some bullshit that sounds plausible rather than something that we know isn't right.
For example, in one part the MC is having a space duel with the villain, the space pirate Rocketlegs, who has solid gold rocket boosters for legsWould read.
oxygen to carry the magnetic waves
It's not that it gets bad, it just feels too... spread out? There's too much going on at once, so many substories that it's hard to really get into them. Sanderson came and sort of focused everything.
he could not abide the idea of.This is a neat effort, but don't end sentences with prepositions.I love it, are you specifically making fun of Hugo Gernsback's "educational" stories?
Thanks. But there's really no legitimate reason you can't end a sentence with a preposition. As long as it's something you don't make a habit of.
Has anyone here read Hyperion? I'm trying to get my sister into sci-fi she's a fantasy fan; GRRM is one of her favorite authors.I think she might like Hyperion or BotNS, but I'm curious if the characters are any good. Are they? She likes good characters.
Just reread Trickster's Choice last night, still immensely enjoyed it.I wish I knew of more books that dealt with spying/espionage in a fantasy setting.
Hyperion is a good choice for her, very character-focused. The characters are varied and there is some good chemistry/interactions between them.I'm not entirely sure it would be a good introduction to sci-fi, though. It's been a while since i've read it, but from what I remember I imagine it might be quite difficulty to get through for someone without interest in sci-fi, although as she likes fantasy it might not be a problem.I would suggest 'Dancers at the end of time' or 'Ringworld'.
Better in BotNS than in Hyperion, but not terribly strong in either
The Hyperion Cantos was shit. Maybe if she only read the first book.
Book of the New Sun isn't something you give someone to get them into sci-fi.
What's with the "General"? If you want to discuss something start a thread about the topic.
It's more practical for the people in here and the people out of here for a general to exist. Keep fantasy in one thread so the fans of it can find each other, not let it spill out into the board as five different threads that bother the delicate eyes of the /lit/ population.
You mean like this thread to discuss the topic of science fiction and fantasy?
are you retarded?
Generals are a slippery slope. They've destroyed every board they've touched and lit will be next I guess.Thanks, fantasy boys
Is it summer already?
If you're going to hang around the pretentious hipster board, the least you could do is make your own ignorant opinions anon.
This book any good, or just another self-insertion masturbation fest?
then just close the thread, you fucking faggot
Good book. Fun read. Interesting lore and world building.Hard to avoid a bit of the Mary Sue trope when doing heroic fantasy, but it is still a good read.
First book is good, second is average at best in my opinion.The prose itself is good but the second book has a large amount of subplots that either don't read well or end up being pointless. I liked it well enough at first but on a reread I really just started to hate it.
But Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion are essentially two halves of one book, Simmons said so himself, and it was split by the publisher.Should change it to "Dont read Endymion"
So I have a few pages written for my sci-fi novel and I just realized that:it switches between past and present tenseit's not very descriptive there's no dialogue at allnot even the mc's thoughtsWhat should I do?
pagesnot very descriptiveno dialogueHow awful. Have you considered writing a play instead?
I could write another play, but to write one under the science fiction genre would feel weird.
stop writing novels, start writing short storiesthey're easier to learn from and execute and you're evidently in need of some serious practice
Finish it, fix your problems on the next draft. Repeat process until you have no problems.
^
Any chance you want to compare work? I recently finished my first solid draft of a 6.5k word short story with similar structureAll plot/event/ and little description and dialogue.
6.5k wordsI don't even have 500 words written.
You said a few pages, so I assumedobviously incorrectly that it was similarly formatted.I have mine size 11, 1.5 line spaced in word...500 words is a page for me.But if you want to pastebin yours or something I'll be happy to read it.
Just got back into fanatasy after a long stint reading the Greeks. I've been reading The Black Company and so far its great, im only on the third book but it hasn't disappointed
Fix it. Fix the tense. Pick past or present and stick with it. Past is better.
What are some good books about the corrupting influence of money?

Awesome thanks
I'm going to, and probably double-major with Biology
Is that list in order. If not, should I chrono or not?
Not really, though I think it's it might be a reasonable way to go if you're not trying to read everything in Latin.

Anyone have a cuck more overrated than him?
Dante, stirner, Shakespeare, Joyce, Dostoevsky to name a few
All his books are the same. Or at least his later ones, never read the early ones for some reason. He uses the same few tricks and the rhythm to each book and plot development are boringly similar. And he is a cuck, you're right. Strong women get away with everything cause "muh girl power". The hackiness of his female characters rivals that of Black Widow in the avengers.
, 
Both universities I attend have been filled with political agitation since last years' presidential election not american and I decided to use the opportunity to start a mostly online magazine/journal/newspaper.I'm lacking experience in the area, and I was wondering if anyone here either has any tips to give and/or is aware of any good literature dealing with the basics of journalism, editing, and basically how to not make a shitty one.
Do you think it possible to pull off a sympathetic main character who is at least technically a human trafficker?He makes his sales pitch to third world prostitutes with no deceptionBrings them to the U.S. to work for himtakes a huge cut, but eventually they go home satisfied with the amount that they made or he helps them get fast tracked for visashis enemies are hypocritical vice cops, full blown sex slavers, and unscrupulous intelligence officersCould it work?
thanks gonna steal this idea op
It could. The character would still be divisive at best
Not necessarily a bad thing imo. What if I went with the Ian Tracy "Intelligence" angle and had him inform on human trafficking to the DHS. Maybe a beta character who is a DHS special agent.
Of course it could work, and it could potentially be quite good.As someone teaching ESL in a third world country, and actively enjoying the prostitution scene here, I'd advise you to visit whatever country you write about and immerse yourself in the environment for a while. Don't guess what other peoples lives and cultures and personal motivations are like, you'll likely be way off the mark. If you have any specific questions, I'm happy to answer. The most common "sales pitch" here is tricking girls into taking a 'nail technician' course with the promise of a decently paid job in the UK or OZ.It would be very hard to lure a girl into being a hooker in first world country. Min wage here is below $200 a month, and a bargirl can get that in a few nights by fucking a few white dudes, so they are among the highest paid people in the country already. Most of the working girls are actually smart and very manipulative and can easily snare a 55yo expat who will fund their lifestyle if they don't feel like ever 'working' again; and a lot of them have some sucker abroad who met her on a two week vacation, fell for her, and now sends her a weekly/monthly western union transfer because she is "a nice girl who only started 'working' last week to pay for her sick mothers medical bills".
You will have a problem writing the female characters accurately. The whole thing sounds like wank fiction.
It wouldn't work well as you describe because it's transparently not true. There are no fucking white knights in the sex trafficking business.BUT that doesn't mean it can't work. You can have a sympathetic character who is also a real piece of shit. Look at the Russians in that new Daredevil show. They used and abused people left and right, but in the end we still cared about them. Why? Because they felt like real people. Even though they lived off the pain and suffering of others they still loved each other, and they'd been through a ton of shit in their own lives. They had loves and fears and hopes and goals. That's what matters. You can make your character as much of a monster as you want, just show the audience what they're scared of and what they do care about and we'll care.It also helps to have bad guys worse than them and it sounds like you're on the right track there.

Fuck you buddy. I'm teaching English to fund living and writing abroad, and the legacy of guys like you follows me everywhere. Fucking losers who couldn't get laid in a rich country.
I am somewhat familiar with China. The average high end escort there earns the equivalent of $30 an hour, here in the U.S. they earn $300 an hour. I suspect that a sales pitch might interest them. In Africa it is also not uncommon for women to go abroad knowingly in order to work as prostitutes in European countries, and the only shame is if they fail to bring home a large enough nest egg when they come back.It's not wholly unrealistic that he wouldn't be that horrible, but he does need to be a little more monstrous to be believable. Maybe he takes a hugely disproportionate amount of their wages so they're practically working for free?
They were pure Pathos. I had no sympathy for them because they made decisions based on emotional arrogance.
Nobody is spamming this thread faggot. I posted it on /tv/ a janitor deleted it, so I came here. Go back to baneposting.
American cinema has been getting away with shit like that for 50 years by suggesting that the guy is good at heart but gotta earn his bread so he does all these horrible things but deep down he's not totally approving it
I'd rather not go Tony Montana with it.
is it possible that audiences are ready for a protagonist who is a CRIMINAL and does BAD THINGS but also possesses EMOTIONS and MOTIVATIONS that allow the viewers to EMPATHIZE with himThe answer is hopefully no. Now that the man is dead can we please stop abusing his legacy with a thousand more le dark and edgy antihero dramas.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cr0nP3k_p4
stop abusing his legacy with a thousand more le dark and edgy antihero dramas.It is always bad to try to challenge the audience to actually think, right anon?Most plebs can't even understand that Walter White was the protagonist but a villain at the same time. If the audience can at least feel empathic to the character, they will follow his storyline. This is no new trend, retard Fucking Dostoevsky did that all the time.
His psychological profiles were a lot more complex than OP's shit, which is just gimmicky. Movies like "M" and "Happiness" made us empathize with child rapists, but unlike OP they weren't trying to make us see their actions as justified. OP is trying to paint as a hero who does good for the world, and the people who are opposed to what he's doing as villains.
It is always bad to try to challenge the audience to actually think, right anon?by remaking the same story that was interesting once a thousand times? apparently you posted this on tv so we all know you're talking about a tv show and not a book. the concept you just described has been beaten into the ground over and over again for the past decade. it isn't fresh, it isn't challenging, and it isn't interesting.if all you're asking is 'is it possible to write round characters?' then yes that is technically possible, but that isn't what you're describing. you just said the bad guy would be nice and the good guys would be assholes, if that's your entire 'hook' then it's complete shit.you probably read for plotyou're probably a libertarianyou should probably get the fuck off /lit/
Fuck you buddy. umm, okay.I'm teaching English to fund living and writing abroad, Nice, I'm teaching English to fund living abroad, getting high, laid, having fun, and investing in my asset portfolio. and the legacy of guys like you follows me everywhere. Good to know I have a legacy.Fucking losers who couldn't get laid in a rich country.Barring Turkey, Egypt, and Andorra, I've 'got laid' in every country I've ever visited. Ive never paid for sex in a first world or European country either.
  is not OP
haven't seen the latter, but who emphasized with the loser in M??
Jorah Mormont was a human trafficker on "A song of ice and fire" and people love him.
like everyone else has said, what a fucking boreconflicted guy does bad thing or gets into crimebut it's for good reason!the law/other guys are even worse! so really he's a good guy/antihero!litter narrative with abused women to be used as props
are among the highest paid people in the country alreadywut
are among the highest paid people in the country alreadywutGarment factory worker: $130 a month salaryPoliceman: $150 a month salary.Construction worker: $5 for a days work often allowed to sleep on siteCute waitress with perfect English in busy high-end tourist restaurant: $250 inc tips salary.Web designer/general IT: $300 a month salaryStreet vendors/Market stall sellers: $10 - $15 a day.Average Hooker: Has *at least* one overseas 'boyfriend', usually in his 50's or 60's, who sends $500 a month western union - requires one weekly Skype call. If she's hot-ish, she can can longtime a naive tourist for $30-$50, usually works 3 nights a week, so $480ish minimum. A few times a year she'll catch an expat boyfriend who will 'take her out of the bar' until he gets tired of her bullshit, but she'll manage to extort the 'bargirl want trinity' - the iphone, the ipad, the jewellery -- first, plus her 'sweetheart allowance'.Average bargirl is on $1000 a month plus not including all the free drinks and food bought for them
that's still nowhere near the highest paid in the country?? that's still below the poverty lineif you mean fast cash with no degree needed then duh, but that's not what you said
that's still nowhere near the highest paid in the country??Not that anon, but do you always use interrogation marks in sentences that are not questions because you are too autistic to understand that writing and speaking is different?
it's to express incredulity that that guy is so stupid, in case he doesn't get it-which he doesn't
that's still nowhere near the highest paid in the country?They are not THE highest paid in the country, that would be the corrupt politicians, and a minority of business owners -- the top 5-10%. Those other jobs listed are the 'good city jobs'. The most common job by far are rural farmers $80 a month, then in the cities, bottle and can scavengers, roadside shacks selling beer and cigarettes, people wandering with wooden carts selling anything from pottery to fake sunglasses. The average monthly salary across the country is $196.36. So bargirls are, as already said, "among the highest paid people in the country."
that's still below the poverty lineNo. Not given the cost of living. you can rent a small condo for $60 a month, buy 10 packs of cigarettes for a dollar, a bottle of whiskey for under $2, a kilo of rice for 25c. A girl on $1k a month is miles above the poverty line relative to cost of living here. if you mean fast cash with no degree needed then duh, but that's not what you saidA web designer or someone in IT needs a degree. They get $300. An accountant with a degree gets $250-300. A native TA with a degree gets $300. $300 is the standard wage for someone with a degree.
you didn't make it clear you weren't talking about the US and you used the dollar sign
Everyone has characteristics that others could sympathize withI wanted to make a character, based in a near future, who brainwashes and sells people to the rich lives a life of general solitude, and when he tries to make even the smallest meaningful connection, he can't help but manipulate the other person, eventually treating them like a robotplays a lot of virtual reality games, it hints that gaming has become a form if escapism that people dedicate their lives toa lot of black humor shenanigans All with no concrete story arc, moral, or pointI thought about doing something similar with a modern vampire who tries, and eventually fails, at living as a regular person, with the story ending just how it started
yes, you could make a full blown sex slaver sympathetic .its just that the more 'hes a bad guy' someone seems at first glance the harder it is .
tfw you will never be guided through hell by your favourite poetWhy even live?
Who'd tap that? Fun to write home about.
tfw you will never be guided through hell by your favourite poetI dunno. You lot are doing a pretty good job of it.
tfw you can't speak italian so you have to read the inferior translated version.
So the breast are the eyes and the hair the mandibles?
This was in Fando y Lis. What is it?
tfw your a native italian speaker and need a fucking parafrasi to fully understand it
I swear people always say there isn't that much difference because Dante pretty much standardised the language?You've just scared me haha. Currently learning Italian so I can read Dante and the other Stil Novo poets
The italian language has a strange history, basically no one speaked what we now call italian since the '50s when people started watching television and learning "canonical" italian, before that every region had and still have its own dialect and they are very different. In the north, near milan where i grew up the dialect sounds like french and italian mashed up togheter, in the south it sounds completely different.tl;dr if you're learning modern italian to read poems written in ancient volgare i have a bad news for you
oh jee!How can I possibly read Dante in the original language?It's not like millions of normal people can read Italian after a couple years of casual learning!
Gene Wolfe says the Divine Comedy is sci-fi. Was it the first sci-fi since ancient times?
How is it sci-fi?
which century? you can mean 1950's. im sure the pruification of "Italian" into the Tuscan dialect was a couple hundred years earlier atleast.Hell, the accademia della crusca was founded in the 1580's!
Why even live?If you do kill yourself you'll probably go to hell and meet your favorite poet though.So yeah, why live
I swear people always say there isn't that much difference because Dante pretty much standardised the language?They say that because didn't read the thing.It's pretty hard to read.Dante's prose is easier, but the poetry is damn hard for a contemporary reader. Not to mention all the stuff that isn't even really volgare, like latin, french and who knows how much other stuff.Fuck's sake, there are verses of which nobody knows the meanings.Pape satan aleppeNot just your average pleb, people who spend their life studying the comedy don't know what some verses mean.
yeah you're exaggerating with the dialect stuff though.
Native Italian speakers have difficulty reading Dante. It sounds to me like you've never learned another language, nobody who has would treat it so flippantly.
"Nel 1861, secondo la stima di Tullio De Mauro, era in grado di parlare in italiano solo il 2,5% della popolazione italiana. Secondo la stima di Arrigo Castellani alla stessa data la percentuale era invece del 10%." eh
Nel 1861, secondo la stima di Tullio De Mauro, era in grado di parlare in italiano solo il 2,5% della popolazione italiana. Secondo la stima di Arrigo Castellani alla stessa data la percentuale era invece del 10%I stand corrected.. I always assumed the unification of the language preceeded the unification of the state.
I didnt treat it flippantly. I said it would take a couple years of work.
" Humanists would say the Divine Comedy is fantasy, but they are wrong. It is SF, based on the soft science of theology. Theology has just as much right to that word science as sociology and the rest do."
Yes but theology is not a science
It's more of a science than math
A few years will make you fluent. Not ready to read the masterworks of a language.
You read English.Please, tell us how effortlessly you read the entirety of the Faerie Queene, I mean it's in English.then come back and tell us how easy it is to learn a language then read its masterpieces.I CAN BARELY READ HARRY POTTER IN ITALIAN.
Tfw my favorite poet was a hardcore Christian. So if there is a hell, I'll never even meet her.
I CAN BARELY READ HARRY POTTER IN ITALIAN.ma leggi roba italiana, no? e non farti trollare
ma leggi roba italiana, no? e non farti trollareno, I've never actually studied italiano. I don't know how I can read it. Just lots of exposure to Romance languages, I guess.
Be like Borges who said something like "I can't read Italian, but I can read Dante and Ariosto". Proust said the same of Ruskin and English after he spent several years translating some of his work into French.
Borges was always cheeky about translations. Wasn't he the one that said, "The original is unfaithful to the translation"?

structuralismpost-structuralismWhat's the deal with people's sudden obsession with this? In the last two years I keep seeing it all the time on 4chan. And I heard it in real life a few times too, used by "hipsters" it's a meaningless buzzword, but I don't know what to call them and nerdy suburban white teenagers. Seems like ever since this Derrida guy got more popular and acknowledged, all the kids have been talking about this and name-dropping this "le epic structuralism" and "post-structuralism". Is post-structuralism an epic new meme?Why do people keep using this so much? Is it to show that they know a new word or something? To seem cultured? Can someone explain this to me? And what exactly are these terms? Why are they being mentioned so often? And is it somehow related to "deconstruction" and what is that?, I read that no one knows, not even the guy who coined the term? And what do people usually refer to when they mention structuralism or post-structuralism? What areas/activities or studies? Is it related to philosophy? Is it a movement in philosophy? Is it related to arts? Literature? Sociology? Psychology? What is it? Is it somehow related to modernism and metamodernism? What books should I read to learn more about it?Am I first supposed to start with the Greeks, all le ancient philosophers, then all the relevant philosophers in the last 1000 years, you know, Kant, Heidegger Foucault, Saussure, Descartes, Locke, Marx, Hegel, Sartre and everyone else? If that's the case then forget about it. But I doubt any of you actually read works from all of them and are still capable of understanding post-structuralism.
in the last two yearsnewPeople have a lot of gripes with some post modern concepts, mainly the turboconservative 4chan crowd. Then there's the fact some of the stuff legitimately doesn't make sense, but every philosopher has portions of their work that are retarded, postmodernists are just a little bit dumber.
It's very popular in the liberal arts and that filters down to hipsters who want to keep talking about the liberal arts after they conclude their four-year mission and return to Deep Space 9 to suck Worf's dick forever
If I can't understand books then nobody can. Getting familiar with philosophy is easy it just takes a few years.
If you think it's new you're either 14 or have been living under a rock. It's been huge since the 70s. It was a movement in philosophy that great influenced literary theory and other areas of the humanities, and, through misunderstanding and general idiocy, turned it into a circus of intellectual masturbation. It's largely on the wane though, thank God, are people are starting to get the hang of what people like Derrida ACTUALLY said. If you want to get into it you should have a bit of knowledge of Hegel and Heidegger at the very least then read Foucault or Derrida.
“Society is elitist,” says Lacan. The characteristic theme of de Selby’s model of dialectic discourse is the meaninglessness, and some would say the economy, of subcapitalist sexual identity. It could be said that Foucault suggests the use of Sartreist absurdity to attack capitalism.In the works of Madonna, a predominant concept is the distinction between masculine and feminine. If textual discourse holds, we have to choose between dialectic postsemanticist theory and textual Marxism. However, Parry implies that the works of Madonna are reminiscent of Tarantino.Sartre uses the term ‘textual discourse’ to denote a mythopoetical paradox. It could be said that Marx’s essay on Sartreist absurdity states that the purpose of the writer is deconstruction.If Marxism holds, we have to choose between the dialectic paradigm of reality and subtextual capitalist theory. In a sense, the premise of Marxism implies that consensus must come from the collective unconscious.Finnis suggests that we have to choose between textual discourse and posttextual feminism. But Foucault’s model of Marxism states that government is capable of truth.“Class is part of the stasis of art,” says Lyotard; however, according to Dahmus, it is not so much class that is part of the stasis of art, but rather the collapse, and subsequent genre, of class. If modern precultural theory holds, we have to choose between Sartreist absurdity and dialectic discourse. It could be said that many situationisms concerning textual discourse may be found.In the works of Rushdie, a predominant concept is the concept of subpatriarchialist reality. Lacan uses the term ‘Marxism’ to denote the role of the poet as artist. Thus, the subject is interpolated into a Sartreist absurdity that includes consciousness as a totality.Marx promotes the use of Marxism to modify society. It could be said that the subject is contextualised into a Sartreist absurdity that includes narrativity as a whole.Lacan suggests the use of the capitalist paradigm of consensus to deconstruct sexism. However, Lyotard uses the term ‘Marxism’ to denote not discourse, but neodiscourse.The subject is interpolated into a Sartreist absurdity that includes consciousness as a totality. It could be said that Lacan promotes the use of Marxism to read and analyse class.
It's been huge since the 70shugeremains largely unread and/or not understood by the general public
Just like everything else in philosophy. I obviously meant in academia.
Those who speak of "post-structuralism" in most cases haven't read a lot of texts by the authors that they have in mind. It's a bit of a misleading grouping and label.So you could make a hyperbole out of that and say that yes, people talking about "post-structuralism" are indeed hipsters.
It's largely on the wane thoughlol according to who
lol fuck you OP and fuck the average person. story time:i went on reddit yesterday and read some thread about weird fetishes and 99% of the replies were horseshit evolutionary psychology. "you see, my fellow supreme gents, the wires of the brain which detect genitals and feet are crossed and this is why feet fetish exist." or "you see, my fellow enlightened virgins, we are attracted to gore because it signals vulnerability and we are protectors by nature." thats the average "intelligent" rationalist for you. those are always the faggots who shit on postmodernism, too. so go fuck yourself OP. this shit isn't for you.
Not that anon, but contemporary philosophers are turning away from what those selected thinkers were doing. Now you've got Žižek, Badiou, Meillassoux, which are all critiquing it. Someone might bring up Agamben as a counter-argument but he's more of a mixture of many things.That doesn't mean the thing is dead of course, it's just not in the academic and public spotlight anymore, yet I have a feeling that it is now actually one of the main reading materials for more active resistance groups e.g. The Invisible Committee.
99% of the replies were horseshit evolutionary psychologyDamn, I forgot how much the pig trough smells. Not that this place is much better, it's just easier to not take it seriously because it's all soaked in irony and cynicism.
Sokal
mfw people on /d/ get the sneaky suspicion in me that I have weird fetishes because I bumped my head as a kid
it's a new thing and uselessthey are methods given like 100 years ago that define almost all philosophy after and before into new lensesit's the method that kills nietzsche, freud, marx, whatever structured analysis without auto-critiquesage and read thishttp://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisr414d8a71a/post-structuralism-explained-with-hipster-beards-xwfz#.anx0e90bb
Yes, this is how some American academics write, those same American academics that produced very bad interpretations of those authors.But that is not the style or content of the primary sources.
Meh, again that American textbook interpretation that reads every French author through the lens of a shallow reading of Derrida.
think of it like those quantum physics for 5 years old who actually give a lot of false information but can put things in context
This is almost harder to read than the primary sources.
quantum physics videos* holy shit
Do you think *he* uses worlds like "saprogenic" or "carbuncular" in his daily speech/vocabulary?
Hey I've never seen this wallace before! And who's that hot piece of audience pussy next to him?
Hi /lit/, newfag here.I've never visited /lit/ before but I've been on 4chan for a few years, I usually only ever go on /v/ or /int/.I've been wondering a lot about existentialism lately, both in my own life and in literary format. What books should I pick up and look into?A friend of mine recommended a Kierkegaard book but I haven't spoken to him in a while and forgot the title of the book. I'd also like to give Nietzsche a try, as I know a bit about him already so I think I may like his thoughts.For some background, I really enjoyed reading The Book of Five Rings, but I'm usually more of a movie-goer than a reader. I also quite like Voltaire, so if there's any recommendations for him, please do pass them along.Thanks!
Sartre and Camus! Don't listen to those who hate them. If you want existentialism you start with them. BUT if you want to get into philosophy you should start with the Greeks. It is not the same to read without the Greeks.
KierkegaardTreaty of despairThe malady unto deathCamusThe myth of SisyphusThe StrangerIn that orderThen Heidegger and Sartre.Should take you about six months.Remember that nobody fucking understands existentialism in the outside world except scholars and people who have formal training, and certainly not this shitty websiteDon't bother reading Nieztsche if you haven't received formal training regarding Kant and Schopenhauer as his writing is nothing but a reaction to those. A teenage favorite to misinterpret
I have done some Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, Pythagoras, Machiavelli, Cicero, etc.I took a history of western philosophy course in my first year of undergrad.I really liked Aristotle until he stopped making sense, when he said that women were inferior to men simply because they lack penises. In that course we read some excerpts from all the big philosophers and some others such as Adolf Hitler or Lenin. This was because although they weren't philosophers, their movements of course had philosophies. Machiavelli was really interesting too!Thanks for your recommendations friend.I should've mentioned in my initial post that I have read some of the classics already!What books by Sartre or Camus should I look at? Any individual chapters?
I did read a few chapters of Kant in university, but I really couldn't handle his writing - his ideas were interesting to me I remember, but I can't seem to really remember them now since the passing of time.I don't want to stroke my own dick, but existence of self, man, etc. are things I think about a lot, hence why I made this post asking for recommendations on the subject. I don't want to say that I understand existentialism because I certainly don't - but I would like to get a better grasp on the subject, hopefully.Thanks for the recommendations m8!
 ctrl+f no critique threads for prosePost one, critique one
http://pastebin.com/JxZ55RHaneed critique, especially for the second half.
I don't usually do scifi, but here you go. For a short story contest on a forum, two chemists married discover a compound that transforms them. Pretty standard crackerjack stuff
The city had been aimed, and on the bus ride home I'd only felt I were in a series of photographs. Worse, I was taking them--every hour was only Moriyama or Winogrand to me. And suddenly my outstretched leg became a most evocative gesture, taking up the evening frame of the interior.
http://pastebin.com/JxZ55RHaHave some punctuation problems, can easily be fixed up.You have a good sense of stylization, but don't have me reading a picture book. I just recommend more experience on outside, to better fill in your descriptions. There are characters in what your trying to describe, but they're filled in by a derivative vernacular.
I've read this before, figuratively. I feel like every paragraph is a shot in a film, but they never dissolve into the elements of a scene.It feels like an intimate scene. Measure it. Not so much purple. Let the reader fill in.
You two. Somebody. Critique my short passage.I always get skipped in these threads.
EntertainmentSilence and inaction are insufferable. I cannot, just cannot waste away unentertained. Every passing second, accumulating to every atrocious minute is torment. Self-reflection and introspection have become so hostile, so foreign to me. My own thoughts are poison. Feasting on any of my self/ill-conceived diarrhea makes me vomit. Pre-packaged and readily-assembled thoughts is all I can process to circumvent my mind’s toxic outputs. Namely doubt, existential fear and what the fuck am I pining away in the name of what the fuck. Hush, soothe and calm the infected rebellious fear factory with some more Big Bang Theory. Let me forget.
It's abysmal, because you combine highbrow name-dropping with what reads like a zero-effort thread contribution. I assume you think 'suddenly my outstretched...' etc qualifies as some sort of payoff or piece of eloquent description, but it doesn't. Think about what you find entertaining and readable and try and give us that.
Feasting on your diarrhea makes me vomit, too, glad we figured this out
like in a fragmented way or incoherent way?tell me what you think of this passage then. It precedes the dream and them waking up.I will after I finish with the bus story guy
Give me a break. What it mean to be "elegant"? There's no ornamentation in a two-sentence work. Nor a payoff, for that matter. Give it another go.
forgot image
Sorry bud, squeaky wheel gets the unvarnished feedback. I feel for u
good pacing, seems like the set-up for what's going to be a bad trip, if this goes how it generally goes for other compounds.you name a lot of places, so I have to wonder if it matters or not where the characters actually are.would read more.
Oh, I didn't notice so much. I count it as a critique. Wish I didn't have to settle for blue balls because the ass isn't on display.
It doesn't have to be much, but put this man somewhere. Reads more like a diary entry. I want to see him doing something.
I can see the line it runs on. Too much of an effort to hit the beats.I'll read the other passage now.
Think of it this way. The audience *knows* this scene. It's a trope. Give it new life. Don't plot it.
you misspelled will a lot
When I was a young man, I ate a rotted tomato on a dare. The stink was enough to drive away the bright-minded, but the need and desire to be cool worsened and to be seen as an object of value to the group, to brand myself as a ‘wild card’ in hopes of inspiring camaraderie I was beyond reconciliation.I bit into its tawny and leathery flesh, and its taste sank into my tongue.In horror, my body attempted to reject its newfound meal, lurching forth from the deepest hold of my bowels. In a true display of courage, I kept it down. The first bite anyway.After making a great show of the depravity of my most recently perpetrated act, I looked to my companions for their reaction. Did I expect them to hoist me up, upon their shoulders, and parade about as a golden idol of willingness and gnarlyness? I am unsure. Though I know what they did do.I was exposed to rejection, a sickening, howling and shrill laugh at my self-imposed suffering.There was no benefit to my destructive behavior. Was this to be my lot? To subject myself to mindless and fruitless tortures for the amusement of my captors, my friends? These rhetoricals brought me no solace. They simply brought to mind the baseless and idiotic existence to which I had cemented myself.I was alone, and surrounded on all sides.2 or 3 years old. Thanks.
"said Atila.""She went downstairs behind him, feeling lightheaded"passive voice
You have an intuitive grasp of pacing, but you could trim the odd word or phrase. Will make it seem less "written" in this confessional-type work.
Whatever.The possum's sore hurt more and more, at every step of the way, from the chicken's place to the willow tree."Hew reach tree? Hew reach tree?"Possum's sounds echo in his mind, voices heard long ago, of young kids playing joyly. But stumpters youngsters and terries keepers keep the path, then free to come as go as pleased, deathly for those who crossed it at this hour past noon. *Possum's plan: Round the house swim the river walk the hill**Possum's plan: Down the hill cross walk path thust thick thickets hit the tree*Bleeding badly! Walking fast possum's rounded farmer's house, then swimming slowly for couldn't fast, cross the lake's short way from shore to shore leaving blood trails all the way. Stepping fastly through the hill the walk path was nearby, but reaching it was fatal, a tandem rushed him over. Bleeding dripping from his body and air getting dense and rough, once rider picked him up and hold him for a while."Don't touch it!" said the woman way behind"Throw it in a bush, it's just a filthy rodent!"And so he did with so much disgust, that he flew to hit his tree.
She looks like a former flower child who cut her hair short and now makes decent money working a real job. She dresses thrifty-chic. Her handbag looks to be handmade, possibly recycled denim. I know from seeing her often that she frequents a popular, upper-middle-class type bar on this route, which tells me a lot. She’d probably like you to know her recycled bag saved a lot of child laborers’ fingers. Likes to dress like money isn’t a big deal for her, but likes to drink with guys who wear cowboy hats and own small businesses.This passage is a little much, but apart from that I loved it. You're a great writer, keep it up.
it's intentional, to differentiate from the Will that's short for William, to make the characters seem like "normal" people but also to give the story a slight cast towards a timeless, placeless scifi future setting
i would read all of this
Here's a song I wrote for my new mixtape coming out in septemeber. Be sure to get a copy fo ya boi. That shit is fire.I'm the lyrical spiritual miracle spherical clerical individual!
hey its me  againi dont know why i like this so much but i really like it. im sad that the possum presumably died though. it is strange in a non-edgy non-faggy way
What's with the recent surge in FF posting? Is that all you, nigga
you should just call him billwil is obstructively obnoxious I couldn't get passed it
Pleasant passage. Reminds me of what I'd read in elementary school. The broken English is a little here and there for me, but I was really just bothered by "How reach tree? How reach tree?".
worthy of the worst of /lit/ pastebin
Bleeding badly!made me lol. the simple language works with this bit and successfully adds to it, for me.
When he pulled the tabbed lever to open the beer, a deluge of suds spilled over his hands and onto his light-grey pants, causing him to curse. "Fucking waitress must've been jerking my beer off in the back or something. Doesn't she know how to tap a can, equalize pressure, not be a a totally incompetent cunt." Gregor, sitting to the right, simply looked down at the negligible mess, saying nothing as Devon used napkins to dry himself off. The two sat starved for words as the remainder of the crowd percolated in, filling open seats like a game of musical chairs. Slightly damp as any basement is naturally expected to be, and just as dim, the room took a deep breath in as the buzz of the settling crowd reached a subtle, momentary peak before rapidly dying down to make sonic space for the upcoming performers. Eyes fixated on the adequate though paltry stage, elevated only a baby's shin up from the floor, the night's emcee grabbed hold of the mic as well as the audience's welcoming attention. Routinely, she addressed various crowd-members by their appearances, highlighting and amplifying first impressions like a fun-house mirror, exclaiming to one man: "Hey, this guy's wearing an Everlast t-shirt, I wouldn't wanna fuck with him. Tell me sir, you look like someone who does something with goggles, please tell me you scuba dive or ski." Participatory laughter and "ski," followed by another friendly barrage of comical assumptions, observational guesswork. Then, after a successful intermingling with the super-organismic crowd, she vibrantly introduced the night's 'promising' line-up, snappily like an auctioneer, eager like a Christmas Eve kiddo. "Finally," mutters Devon, with a traveling glance from his watch towards Gregor's marble encased eyeballs. Naturally taciturn, strangely vocal, Gregor reciprocated his friend's gesture with no more than a singular nod of the noggin. The show was about to begin.
No need to use words like "light-grey". Too technical. Indent the dialogue. Reads like run-on.The second, large paragraph is best paced.
i'm not sure why i like this, but i do
It's shit. You write like you are paid by the word and not trying to tell your story as effectively as possible.For example:When he pulled the tabbed lever to open the beer, a deluge of suds spilled over his hands and onto his light-grey pants, causing him to curse.You could say twice as much in half the words with greater impact, especially if you want to show that Devon was making a big deal out of nothing.As an exercise, try writing this same scene three or four different ways and see if you can tell the difference between them. The voice and habits you are using now are bad, inexperienced, and seem completely without purpose. Until you learn how to write thoughtfully and deliberately it's a waste of time critique your writing, you are basically asking other people to proofread and they will be proofreading bullshit. Same goes for pretty much all the rest of you. These threads are worse than the fanfiction posted on DA.
Hey, thanks guys. Much appreciated
thank you
Nobody's going to critique this because you've provided nothing to critique. Give us more than three sentences. And make sure the sentences are actually worth reading next time.And drop the entitlement. Earn feedback by offering something worthy of it.

I know it's supposed to solely be a prose thread, so I hope it's okay if I share a poem too. Juggling chainsaws, chewing on razor blades,my something-or-other is a feral pet snake eating Chihuahuas in the Florida everglades. The damp rot in the woodwork, submerged in the lake,the torrential rains keep the lifeguards occupiedwhile they're not busy smoking pot in the alley;or complaining about the neighborhood, un-gentrified. The sloths at the zoo, truants like Kirstie Alley,accrue green, and metabolize the air without care,accrue green, and metabolize the air without care.
I like her feet
Of course I did. If I can read about Lydia Davis on bookforum, then I've provided something to critique. "And make sure the sentences are actually worth readin next time." Yes, this is a critique. Doesn't say anything, though.Regards entitlement, I was calling out the troll. You may not recognize him as such. I don't care, this is 4chan anyways. I haven't asked for critique beyond one post. And certainly it's frustrating because this happens often. But these are all my posts:Where else have I obligated anyone? I enjoy critique.
Very good imagery but I think your first line is too abstract or metaphorical for the rest of the poem. It might have a better place later after in the poem after establishing what the fuck you're talking about.Maybe it was the seed for your poem but opening with it really weakens the whole thing. Otherwise I liked it.
I might change it back to Will if that spelling is annoying. Does anyone find it obstructive? This took a long time. Worth it though. I'm not a fan of how most people in critique threads either post something short and meaningless they're never going to finish for replies and other people who just shitpost tiny quibbles and lazy critiques see above Probably the only piece here worth the time other than mine of course-heh.It's good and shows promise of ability; clever. On its own is mundane and unfortunately not clever enough to justify that like Tao Lin or anyone else who does bleak mundaneIf you applied your writing toward fiction, or made it more rigorous and made it nonfiction, I think there'd be a lot of promisedo you have a place where you keep your writing?

How does one get good at writing? I'm primarily a drawfag myself and in art there are certain fundamental concepts that need to be adhered to, perspective, basic forms, etc., and I can only assume that writing shares this principle of fundamentals.Pretty much any art does for that matter whether it be judo or cooking. But how do you go about learning? With drawing, an important aspect is studying other artists, like old masters for example. I imagine this equates to reading a lot of books by very good writers, so that much I understand, but is there a book/resource on 'writing fundamentals'. I want to get into writing but I don't want to end up like most people in these kind of threads.Pls help.
Might do you well to read on aesthetics, or continental philosophy they write often on fictional writers or poets. Badiou, Deleuze, Baudrillard, etc. Also, kill your babies.
Every scene through them becomes a glint on the morning. Children only know the theatre from living room windows. On the podium: is there any other word that becomes the fact for the day? I pass the news on the way to kitchen....the sport is doubtful. Something about a crisis in Ukraine:"France says it will not provide weapons for the moment, saying it prefers to focus on encouraging dialogue. The United States, which is still to decide on further help, is consulting European leaders."The milk is on the counter. Back in the living room, I find the politicians narrating to me. I've never trusted a type.
Alright dude. let's see. I like "the city had been aimed," Shakespeare has a lot of "unstressed x number of iambics stressed" lines; they feel "right" rhythmically. "were" should be placed with "was""and on the bus ride home" has no connection semantically with what precedes it, unless you meant "aimed for". I understand why you might purposefully not added "for", but when you do that it loses coherence. "only" is awkward, meaningless first of all unless you really mean something like "I felt like my the entire bus ride was only a series of photographs. The grammatical ambiguity might be interesting sounding but feels contrived. Other things I think you added to just be cool:"And" instead of "but""of the interior"not adding "a" to the referencesHere's what I would write if I rewrote this:"The city had been aimed for and the bus ride home was only a series of photographs. Worse, I was taking them--every hour was only a Moriyama or a Winogrand. But suddenly then my outstretched leg in the evening frame became a most evocative gesture."You're trying to write a third-person, detached observatory thing on how meaningless everything is while you're fucked up, except aesthetically, which yes we've all seen it before, it's great you can be ironic and not have to say anything interesting. I don't agree that this is shit like some people are saying, but I can tell you're trying to substitute style for substance in this.
The fundamentals of art are not at all dissimilar to the fundamentals of writing, or any other art, which is first the ability to effectively communicate.When you are learning how to draw the most important thing to develop first is your hand-eye coordination, in other words having enough control of your hand to literally translate onto paper what you see with your eyes. This is most effectively practiced with exercises like gesture or still life drawing, copying from old masters will only exhaust your expectations and you will likely pick up some bad habits. Similarly, with writing the first thing you need to be able to do is communicate effectively to your reader without flourish, to get them to see exactly what you do as you are writing. As an exercise you could keep a diary or write for a small paper.Only after you have a basic, consistent, effective voice and a technical understanding of language should you start trying to emulate 'old masters'. Read difficult literature often but if you imitate their style before you are able to understand exactly what makes them difficult and why, copying will be more of a detriment than ignoring them entirely. You will develop regretful, transparent habits like the people in these threads.
I know this is the person from before. Let me leave that alone. But anyways, it's a critique. I'm glad. Won't "varnish" it.I just have to comment on your rewrite, in order to explain my motivation better:"The city had been aimed for and the bus ride home was only a series of photographs. Worse, I was taking them--every hour was only a Moriyama or a Winogrand. But suddenly then my outstretched leg in the evening frame became a most evocative gesture."You're trying to write a third-person, detached observatory thing on how meaningless everything is while you're fucked up, except aesthetically, which yes we've all seen it before, it's great you can be ironic and not have to say anything interesting. I don't agree that this is shit like some people are saying, but I can tell you're trying to substitute style for substance in this.I didn't mean to write about the meaningless of things. I wanted to write about how we define the places we visit with the media we associate with it. It was based on a personal experience with NYC. I wrote about Moriyama and Winogrand because they often simulate human vision in their works. So that in the final sentence, even ordinary experience becomes associated with its simulacrum. Sure, convoluted. But, it's an experiment.
every art has fundamental concepts, and every art is also learned best through experience. My personal opinion is that it doesn't matter what you write, as long as you do it, which is the same way I feel about music and painting. however, the comparison makes me realize that imitating old masters in books is probably not a great idea in writing specifically. It's bad in art too--if you spend too much time imitating you don't get a grasp on your own stuff--but it's deadly in writing. Nobody at all wants to read your imitation of dickens if you aren't dickens, or your approximation of Tao Lin if you aren't him.But if you want the writing equivalent of the conventional learning for art where you learn anatomy, observation, landscape then perspective, then colors, etc. I would recommend doing these things for as long as you can, instead of and even if you think you can write a piece:-put down any conscious thought you have that seems interesting. Thoughts about a show, or how something you see looks, or an entire experience, but also simple lines that you think sound catchy.-watch TV or movies or read a book doesn't matter which and write down what sounds "good" and try to figure out what makes it interesting.-do the above and memorize the plot points, then write them down don't do this until after you've read/watched-practice memorizing conversations you have or hear, and write them when you have the opportunity.you'll start having ideas, dialogue, descriptions, and plots. Build this up and start combining them or riffing off them when you're ready to really sweat over something like it's an oil painting that would be expensive to fuck up.
just notebooks and MS Word. this is one of a few bus-related sketches that I have, trying to make it grow into a book of short stories or novel. I almost know what I want it to say, but haven't figured it out yet. thank you for your thoughtful critique.as far as the spelling of Will/Wil in your story, I didn't find it distracting. when I read sci-fi I expect weird names, and simple-weird is much better than nonsense-weird. I don't like when I can imagine the writer struggling over a unique name, saying gibberish over and over in his head until he finds the right gibberish.
We stand upon the clouds at the doorway to some indiscriminate afterlife, white light from the mouth of infinity permeates the solid and un-solid membrane of mystical dew lain beneath our feet, suspending us in some unknown fashion. As we march forward towards the, for lack of a better word, heavenly, gates, we see a man dressed in all white, a suit that in Earth currency would have cost a considerable amount of money, his movements are graceful and there's an enigmatic-but-kind look on his soft and clean-shaven face."Welcome." He says.I had not tried to speak yet, in bewilderment of the place and as I did try I found myself unable. Frustration eclipsed my being as I forced words that would not come out of a mouth I wasn't sure really existed. Finally, I set aside the challenge and approached the man, I nodded to him, and he stood aside as if granting me access to the mouth of infinity.
This is pretty good, I like it. It feels, if a bit generic, at least genuine. What is, a positive at least. The rapid, unresolved change of perspective kinetically charges the piece, and I felt drawn in quite cinematically, but in a subtle, dogma 95 kind of way. What this means is, I felt that the dialogue willingly goes into honesty and mimesis while being firmly aware of its being a dialogue, which is something I enjoy reading. The fiction in the fiction is also quite compelling, in its barebones semplicity and pregress meaning towards the future of the story. I'd say Heidegerrian, but I've been pretentious enough already. Sorry, is sleepy.A non-fictiony essay of mine. A stupid thing, but I haven't got much to show. It was this, or vampires or people wanking about.http://pastebin.com/1ezBa4xd
Upon arriving in Trafalgar, Dora found herself bewildered by the bustle of the hundreds of thousands and millions of people zig-zagging about one another on seemingly infinite invisible rails, each person looking for a moment as if they were to crash into the next before jarring in one direction or another as if a switch had been thrown at the last second to avoid a fatal collision killing hundreds.There were swarms of birds neatly arranged overhead in shapes that resembled nothing, save for the tight bombing pattern of a military fleet. She was never one for ornithology. They could be starlings.Dora remembered her reason for coming to Trafalgar amidst the chaos and made her way to the Grand, perhaps Mr.Rite could shine some light on the puzzle which lay before her, or lay before them both rather, its annals of intrigue slowly dragging Dora beneath the tides of paranoia and mistrust.She arrived at the room. Apparently he was something of a regular tenant as there stood a plaque on the wall "Detective Inspector Thomas Rite". She knocked but there was no answer, trying the handle she noticed the door was not locked and stepped inside. There lay Mr. Thomas Rite born 1978, Michigan, US, laying headless as if some large sharp object had cascaded down upon his neck cutting cleanly through it.He lay with his hand upon his cock and there was semen all over his chest. He was nude. She searched the room, but there was no head to be found, and all of his personal belongings were missing, save for his Michigan PI license. Written in blood on the en-suite's mirror were two words. It. Goes.
What person from before? define the places we visit with the media we associate with itAlright, well I figured it was personal, most stuff here is since it's more clear how to tone it. The words "only" twice and "worse" imply that the ride being a series of photograph is a negative thing, and that the ride is "only" photographs instead a full experience of life. What that makes me ask, is what are you trying to guide this to? If you don't think that is "existential" or "bleak" in the way many /lit users I would imagine feel about life and thus project onto their tastes the boards' general enjoyment of Tao Lin/postmodernism and writing .  even ordinary experience becomes associated with its simulacrumunless you have a different definition for "simulacrum" then I don't think that means anything.
Read more. Read as much as you can. Read the classics, read contemporary fiction, read histories and biographies, read the newspaper, read philosophy, etc. Start with the Greeks. The /lit/ starter kit is fine too.Also write. Start a blog and write extensively on something that interests you. Begin writing a short story and send it in to some journal you like, or poetry. Work on your writing everyday.

Nothing I ever post in these threads is part of an actual piece of fiction I'm writing, I was thinking about the phrase "White light from the mouth of infinity" and quickly typed that up.
I was thinking I don't believe you
The city lights organized a tryst with the darkbetween the funeral home and church-tower clock,reading: "Night Cometh." Forbidden, the couple swallowed Adam's apple,lodged throat-wise, born a suffocating goiter.And the gold loitered, gone fishin', back in the March,carried by a pack of disoriented lemmings and teeth.So solemnity turned to cheeriness, the chattering ceased,waiting for a package delivery, expedited but late,forcing one, or two, to ask:How can the mosquitoes hold their tongues?while sweat and tears leave blood hanging up to dry?How can we ask the gentleman on his high-horsehow to file for a visa, and leave this sideways country?How can I ask you exactly what I need ask you?You can't, he said in my sleep, nodding like a sculpture,you just have to wait for the shores to mergeand for dusk to dissipate, like your aching tooth.And so I leapt up out of bed,and sling-shotted into space with a gun in hand,dithering, pilfering time, scraping the ceiling,waiting for shortening, for a full filling slice of pie,waiting nonetheless...shiiieeeeet.
shh.
Thanks guys.
Well, as a writer I feel my first obligation is to perform under my aesthetic standards. What I consider as integrating into the work is secondary to that. It is up to the reader if he feels the work is bleak. I feel naive to that.It is influenced by Baudrillard And his ideas on simulacrum but I don't take his nihilist stance, on a personal level.
Epic joke, how did you come up with that?
I didn't believe he was thinking then I typed it
A non-moose conjured up five nines––we're talking glocks, you should know––and fired a fat expletive to the sky like"shiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet."
He? You mean me. Can you not keep track of a singular discourse?
Enough with all this gay poetry it's time for prose.Wet brown shit ran down his leg and followed a thin path a short way down the street. He was facing downhill and followed where it might go with his eyes, finding an unfamiliar car parked on the side of the road close to where he was standing. He was old enough to feel sorry for the owner. His name was Charlie.Charlie was peeing as well and his pants were in a horrible state. On a weekday afternoon the street was still very quiet and on the condition that Charlie not leave the block his mother let him play outside on his own. Alone in the middle of street Charlie didn't know to hide what was happening but there was an unplacable sense of guilt toward his mother that made him uneasy. Finishing his business and surprised at how short of the car his little stream swam he walked back home and walked into the foyer to the surprised gasp and laughter of his mother. The shit on his leg had dried on the way but it certainly did not stink any less. His plain young face held a serious expression and asked if he could a snack.
it's hard to assume that any one idiot is the same as another on an anonymous imageboard
Boring. Not bad in terms of writing, but plot-wise, boring.
Did you get any of the jokes?
My friend asked me to write a concept album intro a la B.I.G.'s Ready to Die. I told him I don't want to offend him and know I will. He asks again, I do it, and he gets offended . I mean what the hell am I supposed to do? I can't deny it was "fun" though, writing something superficial Tony has deep sterotypical black male voice and Bobby a stereotypical white male voice.
Felt it at about the hour. That horrible taste, it was like licking nuclear spillage. The whole jaw is at the dentist. Their legs are starting to shake a bit from all the walking. “Batt”, he calls out. His nose runny from allergies. It was wet and hot in Gamboa. “What?” He heard behind him. It was a confused voice. “Mark, what?” came right after, from a jittery throat. Turns around to find him falling back behind. He watches enchanted at the trees, like a baby to a toy or an animal to the headlights. Upon further observation he is not so far from him. It just seems that way. Cont.?
I just didn't find it funny.
Don't continue, it's not even worth explaining why it's bad. Move on. Start something new.
Nobody ever does. Nobody gets me.

I'm not entirely sure what youre going for with this bit, but it doesn't come off as particularly funny, gripping, or especially well-written. The subject matter is crude, yet not detailed or vivid enough to evoke any real guttural reactions. There aren't any truly awful portions, though not any legitimately good ones either. That all being said, my main word of advice to you would be to tighten your wording, make it more concise and eliminate any superfluous information. For instance, "and on the condition that Charlie not leave the block his mother let him play outside on his own" could be said in fewer words and in a much less awkward way. Anyway, just play around with it.

Now's not the time for butthurt, that comes later.
I have a prose poem. I'm about to start working on a more ambitious and experimental, potentially running/revolving idea.The black trees are frenzied and aflitter. They beg and plead and vivisect themselves for the darkened firmament, and a piercing florescent bulb claws its way into my vision. The fronds and limbs cannot shoulder anymore; they scream. As the first drop appears on my eyelid, the pitiful things fade to an olive green. Good babies, see? You can take more and it will go slow.The rain does grow, the trees' burden mounts, the earth is fed and my open mouth gulps. I've go to change, I cry, I know this and need it now. And somewhere in the crashing swamps she's ready for me, with guts of Spanish moss and bones of balded cypress. Her mood is hadopelagic just like my skies and she sprints to me.When she gets here we will be lovers and above all I'll love her. She throws me into a storm window and if my throat isn't too ravaged I'll be happy. Wild boars will walk on me and she watches. Our home will be joyous and military and Catholic. She makes the ground full, the ancient pines suffer, my eyes close. The storm fosters a furious writhing blanket across the ground and bends all below it. This is the change I need, but first she must come. I'm inside once more. The trees stand still and I am bathed in lightning flashes and the digital light of screens. I am impatient.
hi. erm...never comfortable reviewing others but here goes:I like a bit of stream-of-consciousness and this is certainly that. I'm just not sure where its home is or who its neighbours are. You can clearly write but this piece isn't you doing that. The clended cultural references seem awkward and kinda teenaged poet, like a clever white kid rapping.But to be fair, I don't like anything that includes the words 'pugnacious' or 'vituperative'. I am very confident that amongst bookish girls this will definitely get you laid a lot though.and here's my chapter:http://pastebin.com/dVMHCeeeplease review..
What's the general opinion on applying Blake Snyder's "Save the Cat!" to fiction? I'm about halfway through and seeing how it could be used as an outline for writing quick, self-published genre trash, as recommended by that one guide I lost the link too. Thoughts?I already know I'm soulless.http://blackstorkstudio.com/download/save.the.cat.pdf
not read it but my general view is that writers read about writing to delay having to write whilst still appearing to themselves to be engaged in forward momentum.
I thought that was pretty good. It's not really my thing but you know what you're going for & I think you achieve it. You've found the tone/voice you;re after and it feels like it's really yours - there's an evenness of tone which is always hard to get I find and the imagery is strong except crashing swamps perhaps - must be a better option.nice work.

Random entry I just improvised for my blog. Comments of any kind are appreciatedI was standing in the corner of the room, watching everybody dance in the center of the room. While I watched her, I was unable to hear the loud music and instead, a soft whistle of silence was all I could hear. I couldn't get involved with her, and hardly could I even talk to her while you're still here. Shortly after, you stopped dancing with her. The song was not over, everyone was still dancing when you left.You sat. Alone.She went outside to smoke and never came back. She knew what I wanted, she knew my plan and intentions to ask about it, and she knew as well that you would not answer. He did as expected indeed, and stayed silent without muttering a word."It's not your problem" he said.And he said no more, while looking everyone else dance. He knew well about their problem and the unbreakable impasse they encountered, but he did not care. He didn't want her to become involved with anyone else, especially if that one is one he knew. And he tried to shake off the matter, pretending to play with the hoster's dog while talking about dog related-matters. The dog seemed happy to receive attention, it was not clear which was its race but it was one of a friendly kind as we could see. It was patted in the head by all of us in the party, but for us two it was a matter of avoiding a subject which only one of us wanted to talk about.At the end we didn't talk about it, despite of how much we knew we had to. Maybe neither of us really wanted to touch the subject, and as such it wasn't for us more than a vague mist that tied our small talk. Everyone in the party was aware of this fact, and nowadays, we look back and remember that day, and regret our clumsy behavior. They didn't say a word to any of us again, probably they didn't say a word to each other neither. And until this they, they never saw them in the same room again. Both of them have been walking their own way for quite a while, and I'm afraid that if I hadn't been such a wreck I would be with her now. Despite of what you think of her, she still would be here. It cannot be changed, the past is the past. But we must remember to not fall short again, we must remember how they fell back like that, and how they lost, everything they ever had.

My cross legged Gestalt hovered some where near the more yellow coloured wall of a hungarian girl's interior room.I was half invited. The people were acquaintances at a stretch.As I morphed in to a more ready pose,my left hand rested against the papery material which was pretending to be a wall.The people in the room appeared overly self important and I got the impression if I talked to any of them they would begin spouting either marxist or feminist rhetoric,so I observed the notion float yonder.My invitation was a sort of spectre which possessed everyone in the room.They were posers who pretended to be inclusive,but were in fact exclusive faux-inclusivists, for lack of a better term.I observed a desire to leave.The aforementioned metamorphosis reached a climax in its merging of hand and doorknob.My left hand was almost sweating as it worked, like a cat clawing at a closed door.I saw some eyes drift toward my Gestalt, like a spacial aneurysm.I am not of this world.

I just started writing this today. I didn't really have any clear idea, I just felt compelled to write, so I wrote.I'm not very good, but would like to improve.What am I doing wrong?In the cosmic blink of an eye, one's life is over. In several generations, his accomplishments forgotten. Even if he was considered an important figure during his life, and his deeds indisputable; they will go on to be questioned, belittled, and eventually unable to be recalled altogether.These were the thoughts that ran through Mika's head as she sat in her decrepit, peeling baby blue apartment, staring blankly at a typewritten page, which she had authored minutes earlier. Her gaze began to wander, scanning the four familiar walls surrounding her. One adorned a series of bookcases, spanning the entire wall with their wide oak frames, reaching the height of the ceiling, with the exception of one, which was thin, centered, and only waist high. The inhabitants of the various shelves were James Joyce, Hunter S. Thompson, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Franz Kafka, Cormac McCarthy, Albert Camus, and many more. The books were mostly hardcover, all in mint condition, as her fastidious demeanor dictated them to be. Her survey continuing along the room, the adjacent wall is completely bare, decorated only by the cracking wallpaper encircling a moderately sized round window, through which the view of a stereotypical suburban neighborhood, populated almost exclusively by old, white, conservative, home-owning retirees, can be seen. It's a safe area of the city, with low crime and high cholesterol. At the base of the window is a small table, lightly cluttered with textbooks, bills, and a cold meal from the previous night.The paper, still wet with ink, is violently ripped to pieces, landing daintily on the crimson carpet beneath her feet. “Trivial bullshit!”.Her face quickly becomes streaked with tears, and the air thick with stifled whimpering. At a time which is traditionally suffered through and then celebrated, her heart was filled with despair. Her mind racing with questions of meaning and importance. She stands up from her mahogany desk, stumbling as she tries to walk, only to eventually collapse on an old floral-pattern couch, burying her face in a pillow; a futile attempt to muffle her melancholy outburst.“Why must we all suffer through the same examinations of purpose over and over again, century after century? Are there no answers to these questions? Many great thinkers labored over these quires for the entirety of their lives and careers, never reaching a conclusion other than pointlessness; the very answer that initially sparked the line of questioning to begin with!” Her voice, broken and shrill, pierced through the polyester prison, filling the room with an audible suffering.
Cont.Her thesis was titled “The Spinning Cadence”, of which only the title had been written. Her aluminum garbage-bin was filled with page upon page of false starts, off-topic hypothesizes, and utter mad ramblings.The end of one's academic life is not the most ideal time to have a personal crisis, especially one as elaborate as this. It's understandable for a music student about to officially enter a field notorious for struggle and hardship to have tormenting thoughts about her future, but for it to evolve into an engrossing philosophical dilemma reaching far outside of just her own life was hardly prototypical.The room darkens as she lies motionless, hitherto not having spoken a word for weeks, let alone screaming with all her might. These are the most important days of her life; a time when importance itself is in question.
Hello /lit/. Lately I've begun reading and writing, as I'm currently homeless and I have nothing better to do. I haven't written for a long time but I find myself enjoying it. My librarian suggested that I write a personal narrative. Lately I've been thinking about my childhood and this is what I came up with. Any feedback is appreciated. Houses are bathed in soft light. Trees murmur as the wind flies lightly through their arms, shaking the morning dew from their leaves. They reach upwards towards the sun, trying to grasp it in their long arms. Among the trees rises a barren dirt hill. It stands alone, enormous, like the thumb of God. Projecting from the side a lone bluff, grimly surveying the world below. At the base of the hill lies a small pond. Little distance away from it a dusty road, twisting it’s way over the ground like a black serpent. The sun is at the height of it’s arc, coming to a standstill in the sky.
Baked aureate earth crunches softly underneath my feet as we make our ascent. The hot sun beats us down, burning our backs. My lungs ache and my legs are possessed by a fierce pain that holds me down to the ground, an ethereal tether. We reach the plateau, each of us breathing heavily from the exertion, and sit. Spread beneath is our world. It’s beauty is marred only by the rock jutting out from the hill. It’s bleak appearance draws my gaze, you don’t notice, you keep watch.  For a time we talk in hushed voices, careful not to disturb. We are still as can be in the evening air. I explode into action. I’m up and running, around the top, like a child. You join me, dancing and laughing. You fall into my arms, and the world is crashing down around us as I stare into your eyes, robin egg blue, for the second time. I could kiss you, but I don’t. Then you’ve gone, moving away as I try to hold you close, and dear, to me. I think I may have pushed you away. The pond turns opaque as the sky begins to darken, reflecting what is above. As the light from the sun slowly passes away stars wink into existence, taking it’s place. They dot the surface with pinpricks of light. Each one appears to be very close to the other. Slowly they begin to form a band, twisting like the black snake that does not seem quite so close anymore, here in the dark. A mobius strip has been created in the muddy water.  The curious wind has returned. I watch as it throws about my hair with wispy fingers. It roars, frenzied, tearing at me, trying to break my concentration. I’m staring at the bluff again. It appears to hang over pond, positioned so that if one was to jump he could land among the infinite stars. And I’m running again, like a child. I am a child, I’m ten again and this is a game. My tiny heart beats as I pump my legs sprinting towards the bluff, cutting my anchors loose with each step. The edge rushes towards me and I let go completely, falling or flying.  Bruised knees are in their own way a form of escapism, albeit an unpleasant one. Like most wounds they will heal, leaving behind only a scar. On those damaged foundations we will build anew.
The earth is made of choc-o-late,the sea is filled with wine,And all the stars in heaven's crownWith matchless splendor shine;Yet heaven, when she, looking down,compares her crown to mineA humble wreath of fennel leaf,feels somewhat less divine.For mine's a kingdom more sublimethan aught she comprehends;No handprint mars that lofty climb,--but mine abounds in friends.Nor deity on Helicon,nor maiden of the vale,Nor gypsy's magic tambourine,nor lovelorn nightengaleHas melody enough to singthe strains of my delight;For friends, what little joys we bringin measures more requite.And anyplace I go do foeand foe their wrongs repent,As though my smiling face the woe--ful warps the strife unbent.From Camelot to Evergreen,dear friends, all mankind,My joy is that of bonhomieand not to me confined.
Is it possible to write fantasy these days without it being generic?

America has become profoundly disinterested as a people and our government has mutated into a pseudo fascist corporate amusement park where only the rich have express passes. The recession and the youth of the eighties have raised a generation who are solely bred for the rat race. The young should just say fuck that and build our own industries and organizations, maybe we would ache and suffer in the short term but I would rather die next to people that labored to make their world better than die boxed into a cubicle slaving away at a sprawling machine so my children can get eaten by it too. Precious sleep was fought back by flashbacks to the beggar Al Capone in the waning moments of my trip clutching at me for cigarettes and young flesh. I had thought of my bed all day I was finally here and I felt like the first man on the moon. I couldn't stop thinking of the stream of consciousness I had paddled down to get here. I have doubts that the acid was still even affecting my mind, but with no break to let my mind adjust my thoughts were still warped and geared toward the fast paced trip. I pondered about an extended metaphor that the final stages of my acid trip reminded me of our once proud nation. Long gone was the bright lights, shimmering ideals, and great movements which once defined us. Only the warped skeletons remain and now we wander through them asking ourselves what we’re supposed to do with the tail end of it all. One of the final excerpts of a short story I just started.
A paradoxical philosopher, carrying to the uttermost length that aphorism of Montesquieu's, 'Happy the people whose annals are tiresome,' has said, 'Happy the people whose annals are vacant.' In which saying, mad as it looks, may there not still be found some grain of reason? For truly, as it has been written, 'Silence is divine,' and of Heaven; so in all earthly things too there is a silence which is better than any speech. Consider it well, the Event, the thing which can be spoken of and recorded, is it not, in all cases, some disruption, some solution of continuity? Were it even a glad Event, it involves change, involves loss of active Force; and so far, either in the past or in the present, is an irregularity, a disease. Stillest perseverance were our blessedness; not dislocation and alteration,--could they be avoided.The oak grows silently, in the forest, a thousand years; only in the thousandth year, when the woodman arrives with his axe, is there heard an echoing through the solitudes; and the oak announces itself when, with a far-sounding crash, it falls. How silent too was the planting of the acorn; scattered from the lap of some wandering wind! Nay, when our oak flowered, or put on its leaves its glad Events, what shout of proclamation could there be? Hardly from the most observant a word of recognition. These things befell not, they were slowly done; not in an hour, but through the flight of days: what was to be said of it? This hour seemed altogether as the last was, as the next would be.
He had never allowed himself to displace his consciousness into the rift. Perhaps he feared it would see the eclipse and deconstruction of his soul, something that; as a man a little too tied to the past, he could not abide the idea of. This did not prevent him from carrying out his work with due prejudice and diligence, in fact, he proposed to himself that the very reason he was able to perform the research he so enjoyed was due to the fact he had been uncontaminated by the vast, soul destroying expanse that would have been lain before him should he have chosen to don the technological vestments his subjects so often did in his presence.
brief but positive...I'll take that.
Hard to feel affected by this without a buildup, feels preacy/over-dramatic. I like the sentiment as the backbone of a story though.I looked at Tupac, he was looking off through the trees at the horizon. His outline shimmered as he walked.“Hey Tupac.” I said.“What?” he said.“Why do you think we’re here?”He swung his foot through a rock, trying to kick it down the path.“I don’t know man.”I stopped walking.“Do you think we’re here for different reasons?”He stopped walking and turned around.I said, “Like you being a hologram, and me being a person. Do you think we’re here for different reasons?”Tupac pulled out our last joint and lit it with his laser vision, he hit it and handed it to me. We kept walking.
I laughed, the last line killed a lot of my appreciation. Broad overreaching advice: Use the least amount of stuff possible to make the punchline. It feels like it hits you once then like rubs the hand around on your face.Good tho
I began writing this draft yesterday. Felt so nice, but what can I do to up my game?
Of course it is. Just because it might be a minority doesn't mean it's not possible.

A short story flash fiction, reallyI lit up a cigarette even though my chest hurts. She told me that ship has sailed, and it truly has. I have been hearing this often and not once has it been unfaithful. At a loss for ships, I lay in bed with that whore phrase, make love to it.Early in the morning I leave the brothel and drag my self back to the gray empty harbor, lighting another cigarette under the streetlights in attempt to smother the feeling in my chest and in honor of things past. Of things gone and sailed, by others. Nothing awaits me but the seaside, and yet I do not feel abandoned. It needs my observing eyes to come to be, and to keep on being, my recurring gaze, immaterial, is what keeps the concrete and iron from dissolving, sugar-like, in the water. If I did not perform this observation, others would eventually be forced to rebuild it with gaze and noun, re-say the light refractions of solids.I did not have to pay the whore for her services since I am a known, respected figure in this small town. They all know I harbor the quay whereof their ships take sea.Good prose, dense shit. I'm saving it to my computer in order to read a few more times and analyze, but is there heardThis particular kind of indefinite subject doesn't work with there, it would be better phrased as "it is there heard..." or, IMO, even better as "it is heard, there,..."; also: an echo rather than an echoing would probably be better too, since you need a complement to what is heard and a noun fits best.Very good, though. Is it part of something else? Is there more, is it going somewhere?
Your first sentence makes me think it's starting in past tense and moving into present tense.I'd personally change it to "I light a cigarette" or "I spark up/spark a cigarette".
First paragraph:As the previous anon said, the beginning verb confuses with the tense shift. Establish that the story is primarily written in the present tense. I find the words “even though” to be clunky, could a single-word conjunction be used? The long vowels are not particularly attractive, especially since the utterance causes one to become breathless before the sentence ends. The phrase, “my chest hurts,” is pleasing. The extended metaphor of the ship falls flat and is unoriginal. Thus, the concluding sentence is unappealing, but I feel the sentence is better than the one preceding it. I would suggest editing out the third sentence; it does nothing.Second paragraph:I am not a particular fan of adjectives or adverbs, so the opening sentence of the paragraph irks me. “Gray empty harbor” could endure several rewritings, especially some light editing; there is a missing comma. This first sentence feels off balance and needs restructuring. It feels trite “in attempt to smother the feeling in my chest and in honor of things past”. Lots of telling and not showing. “Of things gone and sailed, by others,” this sentence should be taken out. The subjects are implied in the last sentence and this sentence just stopped me in my reading; its construction is jarring.I stopped reading.Hope you continue writing!
Any chance you can critique this for me?:Also, I know soul destroying is missing a hypen.
Very good, though. Is it part of something else? Is there more, is it going somewhere?It's from Carlyle's French Revolution.
http://pastebin.com/mCJUDzB1Chapter 2 is unfinished, but I've made over 1000 words already, today has been a good day.
I finally have my opening:My book is tedious, it has the smell of the grave about it; it has a certain cadaveric condition about it, a serious fault, insignificant to boot because the defect of my book is you, reader. You're in a hurry to grow old and this book moves slowly. You love direct and continuous narration, a regular and fluid style, and this book and my style are like drunkards.
Good point, I paid no attention whatsoever to verb tense and made a mess.Woah, god bless you, thank you so much for taking the time. lots of telling and not showingThat's the point, really, along with the ships metaphor why do you say it's unoriginal?. It's supposed to be a little play on the expression "that ship has sailed", with a sense of purposelessness/loss but that is not desolate because the gaze of the character whose ships have sailed keeps the harbor in place Berkeley influenced POV.Of course, my prose is far from perfect and if I must explain it this much then I did not do a good job, but I thought I'd clear my intentions up nonetheless. Alsono comments on clumsy language other than problems with the prose itselfEnglish is my second language, I am now proud.Ah, I love it when anons post other people shit on critique threads in order to test the critiquers. Well, at least another book made it to my to-read list.
Where is the rest of the story? Joking aside, the piece “suffers” because I have little context at hand. I enjoyed reading it. The first sentence is loaded with ambiguity. Who is “he”? How does he displace consciousness and why does he do it? What is the “rift”? I feel a strong sci-fi vibe here. While the first sentence does good to hook the reader, I felt the sentence is overdone with ambiguity, but this could be seen as a personal preference on my part as I like an establishing shot. There are some grammatical concerns. The third sentence could be rewritten again, my personal preference to enhance the flow of the sentence and to replace the semicolon with a comma and “see” to “mean”: “Perhaps he feared it would mean the eclipse and deconstruction of his soul, something that he, as a man a little too tied to the past, could not abide the idea of.” In the sentence following replace the comma with a semicolon, because the two independent clauses are not connected by a conjunction and I believe connecting the two clauses would break the flow: “This did not prevent him from carrying out his work with due prejudice and diligence; in fact, he proposed to himself that the very reason he was able to perform the research he so enjoyed was due to the fact he had been uncontaminated by the vast, soul-destroying expanse that would have been laid before him should he have chosen to don the technological vestments his subjects so often did in his presence.” I am not fond of “due prejudice and diligence,” but it works. Also it is long, but that is not really constructive criticism. Again I dislike that I feel I am not able to give more constructive feedback as the flash fiction feels like an excerpt.Sorry this took a while.
Well, at least another book made it to my to-read list.You should probably already know something about the revolution to a reasonable historical detail or be ready to interrupt your reading with research every few lines if you want to get a good grasp on this particular book.
Actually the last sentence of the first paragraph has a slight grammatical error. Honestly I felt I needed to direct my attention to prose. In the second paragraph the first sentence does display clumsy language with the use of the dependent clause; the dependent clause is overly long. Then I stopped reading, because of the prose.
Thanks for the feedback, it's really quite helpful, I only started writing it today, so it's a little rough, so I'll take all that into consideration, if you want to read any further, as it stands, this is what I've written:
Anyone?
The last sentence? Where? And, ah, that is still good enough. I'm still young, there's plenty of time.It's probably going to be an arduous read, then. Not that I mind, though.
I placed my hand on her stomach, waiting for the kick. It never came. Maybe the mother needed to be alive for that.My hand traveled along the curve of her belly and between her breast. I played the bongo before finishing my solo with a smack to her cameltoe.Critique?
Dude, c'mon.
What? Can't handle my style? Besides, no one else is critiquing my other work.
Your writing is absurd, but you know it's absurd.You're trying to make a point but although you know what it is, you want to post this snippet either alone or out of context to make it seem like you're more intelligent that people who don't "get it".
If anyone could critique my third draft of this, I'd be more than grateful.Particularly if anyone notices any comma-splices that I happen to have missed, or anywhere the writing doesn't flow particularly well.http://pastebin.com/1C96Rf0M
Actually I wrote that because it made me giggle. I was on /co/ and a post set my mind working. I dislike the notion that I set myself out to seem more intelligent. People comment that I am broody. I want to show I'm not. By God, I can be funny! Anyway...care to critique? I'm serious here at least.
I feel like you're either trying to experiment with grammatical conventions, or English is your second language.It works, don't get me wrong, there's some interesting sentence structure, however, the fourth sentence 2nd sentence, 2nd paragraph, is just a complete mess and unintelligible.I enjoyed reading it, like I said, it's oddity makes it interesting, aside from that one sentence.If you don't mind doing me a favour, could you take a brief look at the first few paragraphs of this:
it's oddityI should go to bed.
A racing heart bound to a tree, Pounding loud and dullSinews meshed in frigid limbsProbes that press and pry -A ventricle’s limit triedAnd the branches sway with a wanton music
Ah yeah, the genius tyrannosaur finally clambers down from his tower to dispense his phlegm among the peons. No bratwurst in these caves you Lilly-livered cunt. Monstrous applause for the Germanic reveal. Sploshing out onto the patio his innards slept a dance of ruinous acclaim. There can't be found this time of day a number so brilliant. Must traverse many a swamp for ye finds the holiest of sacraments. Eat a dinner of turgid lungs and mayhap you'll be able to enter His mausoleum. Statues guard this ring. Click-clack, click-clack. SWING. No more yearning for the knight. The opulent river-coons swing a tango for this begotten priest on the rings of Ploythaxmus. The bucket is emptied now.
the kind of thing that's fun to write when completely hammered then laugh about the next day with some friends when drunk again, or with yourselfIt's fun as long as you don't take it seriously
Bumpelstiltskin
it's awful and english is not my native language, but here goesI just started writing and am looking for feedback on how to improve, just point out everything thats shit pleaseSlowly creeping comes wearyness, comes fatigue and at long last sleep, sits down in the corner, watching you out of small, tired eyes. As time passes on they move closer with a cozy and peaceful smile on their small round faces. They sit next to you on the couch and you turn your head just a slight bit and nod politely. Over time, you feel the couch tilt ever so slighty to your new neighbours' side and as you look over, you could swear they look bigger than before. Not definitely, but perhaps slightly more voluptous. You start to feel soft fur brushing up against your arm as they spread out to accomodate for their new size. You knew you were right. A bit disgruntled and displeased at their sudden appearance you shuffle to your end of the sofa, trying to bring just a bit of space between yourself and the three unannounced guests. You look over once more and observe the once benevolent faces turn into gruesome grimaces, watching you with a self-righteous, sly smile. Their growth is undeniable now, one of them is again brushing up against your arm. Flight is impossible. Soothing sing-sang surrounds your thoughts, lulling you and tucking you into bed. They have taken control now, throning high above and looking down upon their prey, a mischievous grin spreading from ear to ear. Now it can't be long. There is no rush. Darkness engulfs you. Don't struggle. Submit.You look into the Abyss. And Jump.
Emery I am so tired.last week I wanted to die and I don't know why. I am ashamed I felt this way. I finished my last final at 9:30 Wednesday evening. I felt so down walking the empty linoleum halls and emptying my locker and putting all these big books into my sweater and tying it up. I went to the ladies room and I sat on the toilette. The Janitor had cleaned the floors. The smell was strong and I vomited a little. I felt cold like I have never felt before so I unwrapped my sweater and put it on and opened the stall door and looked at myself in the mirror for a long time. I was paler than my father and skinny as Phillip before he passed; it's a disgrace to be ugly. It's a disgrace to all mankind showing my face around these halls, opening my mouth to chatter chatter chatter. Islam is a monotheistic, abrahamic, religion articulated by the Quran. I know very little about it. I care even less about its teachings. What interests me is the specific practice of hijab wearing. I would wear a Hijab to cover me, they would think it an expression of modesty or commitment or faith, they would not know me.
I don't know if thats a stylistic choice that you intended but you start lots of sentences with "I" and they have a similar structure. Might be dull to read if it carries on longer. I'm pretty sure the "and ... and ... and..." in the first sentence is intentional and I quite like it, but the fact that your overall sentence structure doesnt change too much in the following sentences doesn't make it too interesting, although I liked reading it. Just some input, who am I to judge?also someone please take a look at this: 
Next draft of this section. http://pastebin.com/v80hz3g8
just gonna keep commenting on stuff while I waitwhen I started reading the first section you posted, I sighed because it felt like the whole "captilamsi is evil!!" shit you read on facebook all the time, only phrased slightly better. probably has a bit too much pathos and I also believe the whole "slaving away for the machine"-thing is overused nowadays. the sentence starting with "precious sleep..." was really confusing at first but for some reason the "clutching at me for cigarettes and young flesh part" really drew my attention and led me to read the rest of the excerpt. Correction: "bed all day[.] I was finally..."Generally the excerpt seems out of concept and hart to understand with prior explanation or buildup and the start includes too much pathos, seems overdone to me. Overall its interesting though
Actually just started this like an hour ago"In all my years I’ve never seen such a beautiful corpse.” one beige, ill fitting suit adorned detective said to the other. Purple lilacs laid cross her waist, perfectly scattered - too disheveled to haven’t been placed that way. Her scarlet rose lipstick smeared over her cheek, eyes somberly closed. The other suit went on about how it looked like a Rembrandt painting, though he likely only said it to sound educated. A flash camera POP interrupted their revery...or morbid infatuation over the fallen starlet."
people if nobody critiques others this thread will die dont just post your stuff help others out too
It's 4:30am, but this is no excuse, you deserve better than this crit. I am assuming ambiguity is intentional, I am also assuming you are trying to personify weariness, fatigue, and sleep, if I am wrong, either I am too tired and stupid, or you may want to reconsider this metaphor, I don't think my reading is entirely unreasonable. If I am correct thus far, sort of interesting concept.w several simple plural form issues  a self righteous smile self righteous smiles a mischevous grin mischevous grinsWord choice might need improvement. volumptoussensual connotations, is this intentional?sing-sangsing-song is a better choice, even if this was an intentional malapropism.the end is a little cliche I thinkdarkness engulfs you don't struggle and jumpmaybe write a couple drafts of the end.This was good, especially for an ESLAnon, goodjob.Darkness engulfs you. Don't struggle. Submit.You look into the Abyss. And Jump.
Everytime I revisit the passage I realize what it is I'm actually trying to say. It's going to probably morph more and more as the story behind it also goes through edits but I think I'm getting closer to what I'm trying to say.Very vivid but has some trouble flowing, maybe it's just me but the "to haven't been placed that way" line just kind of stalls it, also the description of the detective, nitpicking probably but hey that's what critique threads are for. I like that you identify them as suits first, was that entirely intentional?
the end is a bit cliche because I was trying something with the words, if you look at the 5 sentences before "you look into the abyss", youll notice they have 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 words respectively but I realise now I should have focused on syllables instead. I was trying to increase the tension a bit by stacking those sentences on top of each other, leading up to the jumplike build-up, short pause you look into the abyss, JUMP
Whatever happened to the daily exercises guy?

I like this - kinda like a less bizarro Steve Aylett.
as  said, it doesn't flow very well and some sentences made me go back and read parts of them again to make sure I read them correctly but that could be completely intentional. Quite liked it overall
First excerpt from the same story...A sign outside the metro station informed us we couldn't smoke so I was glad that had we dropped acid instead. We had left the dull suburbs behind in interest of glimpsing culture, fine art, and as many public monuments as we could. I recall that it was the early afternoon and we’d come out in a party of four. An aspiring composer and reluctant psychonaut, an artist who entrusted her future to computer science but would rather be a tattoo artist, one boyish man who I imagined to be some kind of humanized sea lion, and myself dragged along on the promise of a concert in the future and one and a half tabs of twenty five. We were riding the orange line from the suburbs into the metro center. Normally traveling through the humid tunnels of Washington D.C.’s metro network is like being pulled through the perspiring sleeve of a career politician, but on a fine Memorial Day weekend the boggy capital had relinquished to us a dry and sunny day.
Your first sentence is bad Hunter S. Thompson. The following sentences are worse Hunter S. Thompson. Just from this paragraph I feel like your writing tends to take a rhythm of ending in predictable deflating contrast punchlines. This grows tiresome for more sensitive readers after just a few pages. And, given the stylistic influence and the setup, I have a hard time imagining you're headed for anything original with this story. Which doesn't so much matter in a lot of instances if you're writing about the movements of normal life and using those as framework for personalizing exploration. But patchwork gonzo Ferris Bueller doesn't easily lend itself to soul searching or original thoughts.Also it was pretty humid in DC last Monday.
Memorial day weekend, went in on Friday. Thank you for the tips though. I'll keep working on it..
Tomorrow the foreman will dismiss the packers from the third floor an hour after closing time. He will shower in the locker room and when he steps out he will avoid the mirror. At his locker he'll put his uniform on: it'll be a dark work-shirt, black slacks, etc..etc... then he will drive into the city and park at the warehouse.Tonight, he calls his mother at the home. Sammy is sick again, she phoned Martha to tell him that she would bring the kid over Sat. morning instead of Friday night because she could only schedule an appointment for Fri. afternoon, and she would be busy busy busy filling the prescription afterwords, but the kid would be at his apartment by Sat. evening at the latest, depending on traffic patterns and if he was hungry. His mother tells him to bring her the cream for dry skin, but he had already done that yesterday. After work, he stopped off at rite- aid and bought a pack of beer drinking was not a problem. By designating drinking days Tue. Wed. Fri. he had minimized inebriation and was now confident his face would droop less and his gut would tighten up after several weeks of brisk exercise for him this meant walking laps around the reservoir and burning on the park bench where his height allowed him an excellent view of the nubile asses of passing qt's. He bought her cream, and took it up to the home where an elvis impersonator set up in the foyer was gyrating for the silent generation..He was all shook up, because 103, 103, 104, 106 with the forecasted weekly average at 109 had cooked up that place; it was piss and meat loaf and shrivel up even though the windows were all open and the breeze had kicked up in the evening. In her wheelchair sat Martha the Queen Bee. She wanted her cream, and she weighed barely over a hundred now, so he picked her up, laid her on her bed, stripped the nightgown and applied it where it was sore or where it smelled. She asked him any women in your life since Sammy? Later they watched reruns but Martha was pissed and passed out of her mind how did she get into that in here? then started to complain about this and that and this and that and
At first I kinda hated it but I think you got some chops under that skirt.The minimalist stuff I am a fan of. Some bits like "drinking was not a problem" were quite affecting. The rest was a bit of a mess. First off. Write a proper story. Beginning, middle, end. Characters. Setting. Conflict. That kind of thing. It's hard to judge something that is a mess when you haven't got a structure to work off. I'd drop some of the goofier elements like etc. etc. and busy busy busy. It's fun but it's also shit. Drop the fancier language like 'inebriation' it doesn't suit minimal down to earth language. Also avoid some of the longer unpunctuated sentences. They're a bitch to read.
It's a bit dry for something about taking acid. Drop some of the stuffy language 'I recall', 'informed', 'relinquished', 'reluctant psychonaut'. I'd say drop the middle class shit. Fine culture, computer science, composers - uh. Stop pretending dude. You don't live in some world of literary kings. Be real.
another excerpt from my WIP novel, I've reviewed other people's stuff thrice already & will do more shortly.chapter title: Maurice Van Der Doelen, Stance Coach“Come in, come in. See those certificates? All bullshit. There is no Harvard School of Physical Positioning. There is no Oxford College of Applied Commercial Appearances. I think the Beijing Number One Faculty of Personal Space Management may be for real, but I sure as shit didn’t go there. And I tell you this not only without shame, but with pride. Because what I do here, what my clients learn here, is pure boardroom stance-based alchemy, my friend. And that can’t be learned in a classroom. Except this one. It can be learned in this classroom.” more here: http://pastebin.com/VJj4gwSW
Achka occupied the questionably named position of Secretary to the Undersecretary of the Secretary to the Director of Records of the Office of the Treasurer. His duties consisted of ensuring that the Undersecretary of the Secretary to the Director of Records of the Office of the Treasurer was fully resourced such that he could effectively resource the Secretary to the Director of Records of the Office of the Treasurer. It was essentially little more than a dick-sucking position. The Service was full of them. Achka sat in his office filing the occasional file or mailing the occasional letter, but he spent the vast majority of his time engaging in casual banter with friends or even complete strangers over the info-net, or under the Undersecretary's desk and between his legs. The Undersecretary had no complaints. In fact, the Undersecretary preferred it that way. Achka wasn't actually very good at his job people promoted on the basis of literal dick sucking rarely are and about three months in the Undersecretary had explicitly forbidden him from doing it, lest he fuck something up. Achka, of course, had no complaints. It wasn't exactly unprecedented. Secretary to the Undersecretary of the Secretary to the Director of Records of the Office of the Treasurer wasn't called a dick-sucking position for nothing, and it wasn't the only dick-sucking position in The Service.The Service, like all good public services, was funded by taxes and not profits. The incentive to perform well was small, the incentive to spend money wisely was tiny, and the incentive to create underlings you don't need for any other purpose than to have them ride you was attached to your body and demanding attention. It didn't exactly create a good reputation for the Achkakahisska race in the galaxy, but who cares? Got laid - worth it. Besides, everyone already knew the Achkakahisska were hyper-sexual anyway. It's not as if pretending not to be was going to fool anyone when they walked in on the President and the Director-General having a quickie in the humanoid oxygen-breathing stalls during a break in the Galactic Senate. So yes, in human terms Achka was little more than a taxpayer-funded prostitute to be whored out to his boss as required, but in Achkakahisska terms he was a respected member of society. He was the lubrication that allowed the cogs of Achkakahisska government to revolve smoothly, without grinding each other down. Everyone's a little more amiable to compromise and get on with the job in their afterglow, after all. Dick-sucking isn't easy when you've got a mouth full of fangs made for stripping flesh off of freshly killed prey and a barbed tongue, but with skill and dedication Achka could administer the medication required to bring the Minister for Agriculture to the table.And orgasm.not part of anything bigger, just something i wrote up literally right now. i'm kinda fascinated by my own idea though. i might take it further
I think you could tighten this up a bit with putting a bit more person into the narrator's voice:I'm not sure people say 'traffic patterns' conversationally. '..but he had already done that yesterday.' could sound more like the guy I think you're writing as 'but he did that yesterday.''...where it was sore or where it smelled.' He's narrating, not talking to his mother. I'm pretty sure he'd say 'stank' instead of 'smelled.''Nubile asses' is a word combo you would only ever see on the internet; I cannot believe that it has ever existed in anyone's thoughts.There's something there, but I think you could make the writing more impactful by really honing the sentences, get them as lean as fuck.Example: In her wheelchair sat Martha the Queen Bee. She wanted her cream, and she weighed barely over a hundred now, so he picked her up, laid her on her bed, stripped the nightgown and applied it where it was sore or where it smelled. She asked him any women in your life since Sammy?I think that just restructuring the sentences a bit gives them more urgency and tension:In her wheelchair, Martha. The Queen Bee. She wanted her cream. She weighed barely over a hundred now so he picked her up, laid her on her bed, stripped the nightgown. He applied cream where it was sore or where it stank. She asked him any women in your life since Sammy? No.I could be wrong though. It does happen.Mine is this if anyone fancied giving feedback.

one beige, ill fitting suit adorned detective said to the otherThis is terrible. If you want to describe what they look like, whatever. But the "adorned" shit is clunky as fuck. Just use a fucking verb. "one detective wearing a beige, ill fitting suit said to another"Purple lilacs laid cross her waist"cross" isn't a fucking preposition. "crossed her waist" or "laid across her waist"perfectly scattered - too disheveled to haven’t been placed that wayThey're perfectly scattered, but disheveled? What? Disheveled implies something is unkempt, messy. I can't even tell you how to fix this because I can't tell if you're trying to describe that the lilacs look deliberately placed or that they look like someone tried to make them appear disheveled. The other suit went on about how it looked like a Rembrandt painting, though he likely only said it to sound educated.Good on you if that's some self-aware irony. But given how purple your prose is, I'm guessing it's not and it flew over your head. POP...Bad.
hey man, you should really chill
Great exposition. Remove "The next morning...", find a more formalized transition, as I agree there should be one. Some issues with tense.Continue, certainly.Indent after the first sentence, to pace it a bit. Keep your tense straight, it afflicts the storytelling. Find a strong arc in exposition, I became bored quickly.Me.
Thank you! It's much more bleak than I intended.The last line esp. has the EDGE factor. I'm taking it out.
Tried a short bit of inner monologue, could use some critique. I've taken too long of a hiatus from writing and reading and I fear my skill has fallen by the wayside.The snow and frost bit into my ankles through the thick leather of the boots that sat loosely on my cold legs. The shivering hadn't stopped in the last hour, and I wasn't alone. Hans sat frozen on metal bench of the beutetraktor. The ice danced and shook as the vehicle trundled along. He stared endlessly into the white abyss. “Charlie,” I shouted over the rumble of the engine. My finger rose lazily and waved in the general direction of the ice caked shell of a man that sat across from me.Charlie turned to look, and at a glance it seemed as if he just fell away. Hans' frigid body fell out of the tractor with a small white puff and a wet metallic bang when he bounced off the towed PaK gun that trundled along by hitch from our humble vehicle. My eyes followed his grey form as it slowly drifted away in our wake. I pursed the chapped strips of dried meat that had served as my lips for the past week. Dreams of yesteryear filled my frozen brain. I felt the inexorable lust for another to join me inside the warm confines of my psyche. The gentle breeze that wafted across the Rhine swept through my brain, the sweet taste of wine on my tongue titillated my taste buds.  No, I hadn't a sweetheart like most of the lads. My experiences weren't through rose tinted goggles of romance and bravery. I relished the time spent on my own, given my own devices and my own conquests as week after week passed by my bored adulthood. A smile cracked across my shivering cheeks, the pain from the facial motion jerking me out of the simple summer paradise that gave me a brief respite from the white hell of the Ukranian countryside. Kiev had fallen. I looked over my men with tired disdain. They were the broken remnants of Hollidt's Sixth Army. A tired band of boys – children, if anything – the lucky few that managed to join me as I so shamefully retreated in the face of Soviet tanks. Tanks, that we had been tasked to stop with the battered PaK 39 gun we captured from the Bolsheviks. I would have gratefully accepted any punishment sent my way for such treasonous thoughts as retreating in the face of battle. No shred of authority could reach out to these wastelands, anyway. My men were true children of the fatherland, that much is certain. Hans especially, what a trooper. Always would he stir the spirit of the platoon with his good deeds and prideful inspirations. Bless his soul. Carrion birds roost during the winter, not daring to fly out lest the ice drag them towards a cold death.At least he would have his own peace.
Started a new project yesterday.Inspiration hit and now I have a rough plan of the whole thing, as well as a first chapter of just over 2000 words penned.If anyone wants to read:http://pastebin.com/HGGBzyMd
Bit stilted. More brevity. Larger words are awkwardly placed.Try not to reuse words so much in that context; I read 'soul' too many times. It's a heavy word. Maybe you should read more esoteric works to compliment your vernacular?
A bit too written.
Thanks for the feedback, I'll try and look at any words that look awkward when I'm going through redrafting.
Good post, thanks for your honesty.I've come up with a more formalised transition by making the main character sign off. It's written from his point of view because it's meant to be extracts taken from his personal journal.What issues did you find with the tense? I expected to mess up somewhere so it's not a surprise.
Yes, that would be perfect. I find the work would be more foreboding that way.There's some confusion with past and present tense. Probably because of the journal format.No, I liked it. I was able to imagine it as a esoteric short film in my head.
I'm used to writing in the past tense because of history projects. Everything is always "Constantine said" or "Genghis rode to" which rubs off on you after a while.I don't know what kind of project I want it to be yet, I just wanted to write about Byzantium and other cultures without being constrained by actual history. I'm also not sure if I want the main character to eventually ascend to the throne Meaning the journal would be a sort of "Secret History of the Mongols" kind of thing, or if he will just be recording daily life in the cultures he experiences as a diplomat.
I could see the guy dying in the end, personally, but that's probably just my shitty mood. Good luck.
Death would be good actually, because I want him to explore the themes and ideas of Neoplatonism over the course of the text. I could have his health slowly decline the more he writes This would become a plot point if he became emperor, and have the text/his journal end on a cliffhanger when he dies suddenly.

The other anon is right, some things are a bit overwritten, making a few of your sentences awkward. The snow and frost bit into my ankles through the thick leather of the boots that sat loosely on my cold legsThis is a good example, as you're trying to describe your scene with a lot of detail, but you end up repeating the same thing. Just by mentioning "snow and frost" itself a redundancy! you've already established a frigid setting, and going on to say "cold legs" is superfluous because you've already established snow and frost biting into your ankles. No reader would assume that only your ankles are cold, and that the rest of your body comfortable! If you wanted to, you could shift the personification from the snow and frost to the cold quality of the s+f, but it's ultimately unnecessary. Also, describing how your boots sit on your legs should be done elsewhere, if anywhere, because it divides the aim of the sentence, and it ends up feeling like a laundry list of initial setting conditions for your story. Another thing, describing your boots as "thick leather" but still describing your legs as cold implies you've been outside in the snow and ice for a while, and you could work with this implication by making it more direct later on in the chapter/paragraph/story.
I've always like interviews/dialogues formatted as formal interrogations as a unique but not unbearable way to tell a story, so nice format. I just hope the entire story isn't one big interview

I haven't read it yet, i am actually starting "The Dubliners" lately which i like to some extent but i fear "Ulysses" is gonna have the same effect on me than some Beckett's novels like "Molloy". Like ok, i guess there is a sort of existential struggle/absurdity that Beckett wanted to pass through language but for god's sake, why do we have to read this?

People are stupid. They think to themselves "muh ancient Greek epic laifstyle xddd" and assume it's awesome because it's unknown to them typical tourists. I'm Greek and Ulysses sucks. Had to read it in school 3 hours each week. Absolutely horrible, easily digestable and pointless, even the teachers hated it.

Good, because I don't.
Did  just confuse Ulysses with The Odessey?
I think so, kek.
how's that even possible
Well this is pathetic. Not only do you confuse Ulysses and Odyssey, you pretend to know a lot about ancient greek culture while not being able to differentiate between a character's greek and roman name.
Is it true that it's illegal to play video games on Greece?
intricate bait tbh
Molloy and the entire trilogy as a matter of fact is a joy to read. Ulysses is monumental, if not for the unparalleled control of prose style and objects of cultural import, then purely for the brilliant character of Leopold Bloom.
Considering you are probably about to be a college studentYou should really take a class on Ulysses, there is a lot that is basically impossible to understand on your own.Hopefully you have a decent Joyce scholar at your school.A lot of the book has to do with the concept of cuckolding, in a grander sense; can anyone own anything at all? What does it mean to take ownership of god, of other women, of sexuality. One could also argue that the book makes a case for the completeness of the world, as in: everything in the book has a purpose although it might not look like it at first. And that god's love transcends the banality of the concept of ownership Molly's memory of eating berries or some shit on a hill with Bloom.If you have mild autism and really like to dissect paragraphs, you can write 10 pages on a single paragraph.

I mean, it wasn't as good as To Kill a Mockingbird, it makes you appreciate how important the point of view of Scout as a child was to that book. The writing with Scout being older just doesn't work as well.
So are we going to do an entire thread pretending we've read it?Why not, every other /lit/ thread does it.
I didn't like the ending when Scout asked when racism would be over and Boo Radley replied "Go set a watch...man."

A new excerpt from the book, courtesy of HuffPo.1/2"Daddy, I'm home from New York City, bastion of equality, with a college education and a new attitude on race."Looking up from his newspaper, Atticus said, "Now, Scout, I may defend a negro in court from time to time but only if I don't have to see them much. Segregation suits us Southerners just fine.""No, daddy, there's a new way of doing things," said Scout, shaking her head. "Those Yankees have it all figured out. You see, in the North, they aren't racist anymore! They invented these things called ghettos.""Ghettos? Why, I was just reading about those in this here newspaper!" exclaimed Atticus.Scout closed her eyes and nodded. "Ghettos are places where blacks aren't legally forced to live, but they wind up there anyway thanks to jobs, housing costs, and discrimination in white neighborhoods.""The government doesn't have to enforce racist policies and look bad?" asked Atticus, clearly interested, as he shifted forward in his seat."No, daddy, that's the point! The Northerners have the moral highground when talking about Southerners and they still don't have to look at black people. It's wonderful! There is an amazing place in New York City called Harlem. All of the blacks live there. They beat one another, shoot one another, drink, use drugs, join gangs, and the cops don't even have to come around! The children go to third-rate schools and that's okay because it's based on taxes, not a concerted effort of the government. The blacks don't have a chance. Don't even get me started on these new 'public housing projects.' The government wants to use this post-WW2 boom to construct housing for the poor on the pretense of charity, even though the money won't last forever and they will really serve and a means of consolidating blacks and moving them off of prime real estate that can be used for economic development!""Scout, I must say..." Atticus covered his face with his hand. Tear drops fell and stained his wool pants.
2/2Scout walked over to Atticus and started to rub his back with her right hand."Daddy, are you okay? Don't feel so bad about being a racist inbred piece of white trash. I'm not judging you with my Northern liberal education. You don't know any better.""No, my beautiful daughter, it's not that. This new way of doing things sounds so wonderful. I think we should both make it out life's mission to end segregation and institute ghettos. We can start with St. Louis!" Atticus stood up from his chair and looked out the window as he imagined a new life for Southerners, free of guilt but fearful of home invasions."Oh, daddy, I am so glad you understand!" Scout embraced her father around the neck and kissed his cheek. "I have someone to introduce you to."The screen door swung open and in walked a rodent-like creature. Its skin was an opaque yellow, a large nose rose like a mountain between two small shiny black eyes, and two curly locks of hair fell messily along either side of its face. It wore a large flat brimmed hat and a black cloak crudely covered its twisted and misshapen body. It stuck out its clawed hand."Feivel Kuntsler, attorney-at-law, at your service. For a price, of course, but you're mishpocheh now so I'll give you a discount.""Daddy, this is my new husband. He's a real mentsh. We already have all the plans drawn up and I already called all of the local ministers. We march tomorrow!""Feh!" spit Feivel. "We'll show those racist shmendriks the error of their ways, especially concerning Antisemitism!""Darn right!" giggled Scout. She looked at her watch. "Oh! Look at the time! We really must get going across the tracks.""Why?" asked Atticus."Feivel made an arrangement with a local black bull. He's going to fill me up with nine inches of black pipe! I need a good breeding.""The blacks know how to pleasure women!" exclaimed Feivel. "I don't care much for intercourse myself. I prefer the company of Presidents." He pulled a wad of bills out of his pocket, held them up to his nose, and took a deep breath. Feivel shuddered with pleasure as he exhaled.Atticus's eyes got wide with amazement. He had imagined white women being defiled by black men ever since his famous court case. He turned to Scout with a smile on his face."Can I watch?""Certainly, daddy," said Scout, giggling once again. She grabbed Atticus and Feivel by the waste and the trio walked out of the house. They started their journey to the place where Scout's big black bull was waiting to split her pussy in two.FIN
This is one of the only things from this site that has ever made me laugh. Thank you.
Harold Bloom, the objective mediator of literature, likes To Kill a Mockingbird
Harold Bloom is also shit though
Genuinely excited. I had to study TKAMB for English Lit class. Granted, other than the court scenes and Racism focused parts, it was shit-tier, hopefully the new book will have all the annoying characters like Boo dead and we can actually focus on Southern attitudes to blacks.
From what I read, its a prequel.
It's a sequel. The new book was originally written first but then the publishers asked her to write a prequel t it TKAMB.
I believe it contains substantial flashbacks to Scout's childhood that the publishers persuaded Lee to rework into a new novel.
oh my god ahahhaha
The only thing I can compare to this is strangely Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead where the latter was also thought of first and then the first was written as background, but ended up the becoming far more famous.If that case is anything to go by, though I'm probably infuriating some people here for using genre fiction as a reference, Go Set a Watchman is going to be the quieter, more profound, but lesser known book.I'm kind of excited, actually. I'm not American so I read Mockingbird and watched the great movie just a few years ago, and I thought it was a perfect, little masterpiece to be honest.I'm slightly worried it's going to be a sloppy first try, or consists of too many childhood remembrances so that it feels more like a proto-Mockingbird, but I don't think Harper Lee would want to publish it if that was the case. AFAIK upon rereading she was surprised how well it stood alone.
Wait, not on her initiative after all ... I wonder where I got that from. At least she's seemingly consented to it http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/friend-harper-lee-was-fine-the-day-before-sequel-announced/ar-AA94OzL

Nothing went wrong. Do you remember the atmosphere in the very last bit? More tranquil, sentient and powerful simultaneously than I've ever had in my own life, even though I'm not a literary character and therefore I subconsciously do believe in some meaning.I wish life of mine and most of people around me went as ''wrong'' as in this novel.

It's exposition. No style. If you already comprehend life's absurduty as most of us non-christposters do then it's uninteresting exposition because there's no style. Nausea doesn't have exposition much and full on style; hence 10/10.
What went wrong? You read Camus, that's what.
yeah, camus CLEARLY wants you to kill people you dislike on a whim, and CLEARLY nothing went wrong when the guy got fuckin executed - meursalt is neither a hero nor a villain. i have no idea why you insist on painting characters in such black and white terms.
if you think the stranger is 'all exposition' then you clearly understand neither the absurd nor the stranger.
Go on. The trial, the tedious funeral processions, the lengthy discussion with the Police man or whatever he was again in that office about God, the.... Prove me wrong.
i mean, what's your point, that you think they're boring so therefore it's all exposition? i fail to see how that follows even a little bit.
I didn't. Camus' ambivalent take on this character is some common knowledge, it's just the point where the question is coming from - ''what went WRONG?'' - being kind of a wrong approach. If a character sympathizes with the author's philosophical beliefs, he obviously can't be objectively wrong in his doing.Point being: even if things went wrong, the idea of the story is that the proper attitude was carelessness about the execution and the cause of it.Now calm down.
It's boring because it's exposition. It's exposition because it eposition. Camus wanted to novelize "the stranger in society; the individual" and to novelize a concept is to flesh it out in the medium by exposition. Which is what it is. Ya dig?
You have committed suicide.My condolences.
you think the stranger is a character piece about meursalt?! i couldn't disagree more. the point is that meursalt's experiences and his perception of them are filtered through a veil of impassivity. the world is a stranger to him, but he embraces it in each and every moment.
Except the point is that he DOESN'T embrace it in each and every moment. So he gets killed by the state.
The trial demonstrates the major theme of isolation. We are all alone in our heads. This is shone by the fact that most of the witnesses claim to have known Mersault and they claim to know that he is not capable of murder. This shows that Mersault is not some freak who is disconnected from all other humans. All humans are already disconnected and they only pretend to understand the minds of their fellows.
How's that not exposition?
Well by your logic the whole of the brothers karamazov is also exposition. By your definition of exposition there is no part of any work that is not exposition.
There's always "style" which isn't. Which Camus didn't have much off.
I think you've already understood you don't like camus, but you have yet to understand why.
Wrong , you don't understand why. I don't like his lack of style, extravagance, boringness, muh feeling that he think what his writing about is revelatory Do you undrstanf now ?
where do you get that he doesn't embrace it in the moment that he kills the muslim? i think it's pretty clear that camus doesn't mean to endorse the shooting of the man, but i can't really agree with it being because meursalt doesn't embrace the absurd - it's because he embraces it with a sort of nihilism. the stranger is not a fable - it doesn't mean to idolize its protagonist. him getting killed by the state is pretty directly representative of why a nihilistic approach to the absurd isn't tenable.
thinking that disliking camus' style and camus not having style are the same thing
He writes like a 5th grader. Unless your keen on giving all 5th grader the benefit of the doubt of calling their lackluster writing a "style" then you have no leg room.
lol what the actual fuck? do you accuse hemingway of also having no style? russian realists? because just so you know, the absence of flowery language and vivid descriptions does not imply a lack of style. camus is PURPOSEFULLY leaving all such things out of his text, because he finds them inconsistent with his narrator's perspective.
You cannot try to be taken serious and say things like "he wrote like a 5thgrader". It's ridiculous. You're losing all credibility. Dislike the mann and his style all you like, but have the decency to admit it's just because you don't like him, and not because Camus has no skill, because that's wrong. The man could write.
Camus was trying to emulate Hemingway when he wrote the stranger. The scene where Mersault kills the Arab was actually very vivid."I knew I had shattered the harmony of the day, the exceptional silence of a beach where I'd been happy. Then I fired four more times at the motionless body where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace. And it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness.
You have misunderstood both authors
All I said was that Camus wrote a stylistically impressive passage and that he himself said that he was channeling the style of Hemingway. What did I misunderstand?
 that he himself said that he was channeling the style of HemingwayPlease provide precise reference
u hate him cuz u ain't him
Having a problem figuring out how to frame my argument in an essay that I'm writing. I guess it's an issue of style. It's not for school/business or anything, just a personal project, but I'd like it to be coherent. Its about the future of the field of music criticism and the internet.Anyway, my general concept here is "The future of music criticism will involve X" X being the idea that I'm going to expand upon in the essay. But I don't really know how to introduce my argument/thesis. It sounds weird to just say something simple like "So 10 years from now the music critics will all be like X, here's why". How do I introduce my argument here in an intelligent way that isn't so flat? And a way that feels natural. Any examples of general guidelines would be appreciated
If you don't know how to write spend more time reading.
Try reading Montaigne's essays, and other great essayists, or even some shitty essayists, since the essay is a time-honoured tradition that has only fallen to the wayside relatively recentlyTry reading essay-ish articles in art criticism and academic papers, especially ones treating general or grandiose topics Try reading essays of "public intellectuals" in major fancypants periodicals to get an idea of the modern style Try reading about the history of the dialogue format of essay e.g. Plato, but it also has Medieval, Renaissance, Enlightenment, and modern forms which can be very barebones, casual, and non-fancyTry reading aphoristic styles like Nietzsche's or Nicolas Gomez Davila's Try reading monographs if you think your topic will near that length, since they are like mega-essays
many thanksYeah, I know
If you're looking purely for a way to introduce your essay, look into the Classical Proem or Exordium.
I think you may want to develop your argument more. IMO once what you want to say if its worth saying is blooming and your able to say it as well as you can, it becomes obvious how it must be said and therefore introduced. Can you tell us more about what you are writing?This is a bait to get you to introduce the idea to us btw.
Let's say that your argument is that in the future music critics will address the medium more than the message I.e. The lyrics, the overt politics and 'scene' that it is a part of.Just give them a rough idea of the cause which you stand for an overview of its history, reception and current trends.Indicate the presentation style you wish to use throughout the essay Grandiose and scholarly or unornamentalised and anecdotal.Indicste whether your tone is lighthearted, ironic, or serious.Indicate why you're the man to write this paper.Indicate why you're the man to attack your opponent's credentials, and be honest, if you're just a student, by humble enough to write as a student, not as if you have been working for Rolling Stone for twenty years.Finally, show that you're going to be consistent with the facts, don't give any ammunition to your opponent, and stay temperate by using common speech.

Hey /lit/, what do you think of this How to Read guide I made? I think it will be very helpful for people who want to get into reading.
Kek
Very helpful I woud say but I would recommend putting a warning on oddysey cause it can be scary and quite sexist just saying guys
Basically how I got into reading.Just lots of holes. You should the whole Harry Potter series there and a few more fantasy YA books. Then all the published ASOIF books with a few more adult fantasies thrown in. A couple more epic poems in there with Odyssey and Lord of the Rings. Then, Ulysses and the whole meme trilogy.Your chart is incomplete.
Loved it.But I won't be caught dead reading pop culture fags Martin and Rowlings. I'm too much of a hipster. But I'll give Odyssey and Ilyad a shot after I'm done with underground shit marxist writers who can't type anything original but won't be known by the so called 'elites' of /lit/.
It is very scary, but it comes after Game of Thrones so the reader should be prepared.I don't think it's very sexist. One of the main characters, Odyssy's wife, is very faithful and a nice lady and she helps him in the end.Well that spot on the chart is supposed to represent the whole HP series same with game of thrones. I think after 7 books the reader would be ready for something more advanced. And it's even good for Harry Potter because as the books go on, it gets more mature so you get better at reading going through it. I'll keep a note for the next version though.
Don't get people into shit like HP, a better starter book would be something like Clockwork Orange or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, they aren't hard to read or particularly deep but things like Harry Potter or GoT can be a slippery slope for new readers.
This is pretty fucking retarded OP. For starters, if you're trying to get into literature, there's no value in reading Harry Potter or ASoIaF. Also, suggesting Joyce for the fourth book for someone to read is stupid as fuck. Reading is a skill, it needs practice just like everything, and jumping right to exit level after only reading the Odyssey is retarded.
Good stuff OP, mods please sticky.
History is a much better beginners genre for literature. Not too difficult to understand, but educational and interesting. If not history, atleast fantasy that's better than HP or a song of memes. Something like Tolkien or wolfe
What do you think Plato would have thought about Christianity In The Republic, Socrates says the Greek gods must not be real because they are not perfect, and they are not a good example for the youth with their licentiousness. Would Christ and the Trinity have been an acceptable God for Plato/Socrates?
I feel like Plato would be kinda offended/incredulous at the idea of the Incarnation more than anything.
why's that? Greek gods took human form all the time, and he doesn't seem to criticize that from what I've read
I think Plato's main criticism of Christianity would be against charity. "love thy enemy" seems pretty antithetical to someone who wishes to build a strong and unified state, and celebrate victories in wars
True, but its not like Christianity was a hindrance to conquering European powers. If anything I think it served as an ideological unifier, and even perhaps the cause of the expansion, to spread the Word of Christ.
Matthew 28:19 "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit..."Christendom was expansionist as fuck.
Plato said Homer's portrayal of the gods must not be real, because they aren't perfect. It would be retarded to say gods can't be real unless they're perfect. The premise is that the gods are perfect, and any other depiction is improper. There's some confusion because he uses "god" to refer to "godkind" as the author of only good, and people think he's saying "God", and saying the gods are a fiction but a perfect God is a reality. Greeks said "god" for "godkind" as we say "man" for "mankind"; the Greeks also do this with other things, like using singular "barbarian" to refers to the Persians as a people.As to how he would take to Christianity, he was already a serious Orphist, which is a lot like Christianity.
Yeah, I don't think Christ is suggesting this be done by force of arms.
So why was Socrates tried for atheism? A misunderstanding?
By contradiction, sure
Socrates was tried, among other things, for creating new strange gods forms
I doubt the Republican has anything to do with Socrates other than as a character name, even more than the other dialogues.If you want to talk about the trial of Socrates, it was because he was extremely chummy with people who wanted to overthrow the Athenian democracy and actually had dome so a couple of times. It was probably believed he was the one influencing the youth to do this. There was no evidence for his atheism, in fact that wasn't even his original charge in that dialogue. It was for worshiping strange gods; then Socrates confused the prosecutor and he changed the charge to outright atheism, but no evidence was presented for this. It was the epitome of McCarthism and trumped-up charges, at least that is how Plato paints it
the Republic
I doubt Plato's forms had anything to do with the charges against Socrates. Worshiping strange gods was a serious charge because it could imply different loyalties, say if you worshiped Persian gods during the Persian wars, you can see how that wouldn't look good. I don't think it meant anything in the Peloponnesian War, though, since the Spartans and the Athenians worshiped the same gods, and unless there was a conflict, the Greeks simply identified their gods with the gods foreigners worshiped. It was just a bullshit charge
What do you think Plato would have thought about ChristianityHe would have presented a photograph of an overweight, bearded Eastern European, and written "greater-than sign pure ideology" in green crayon on top of it.
metempsychosisa lot like christianity
The matter of the actual charge has already been discussed well by ; there doesn't seem to be any hard evidence for Socrates being an atheist, or at least a position that asserts the truth of atheism. More probable, he may have been an agnostic, if one takes seriously his characterizations of himself as not-knowing. With respect to the Greek gods, Socrates is still shown by Plato to be peculiar; one of his common oaths is "by the dog", which in the Gorgias is expanded to "by the Egyptian dog", that is, probably Anubis, which would strike an Athenian as odd. Further, in the Apology, Socrates's demonstration of the oracle's proclaiming him the wisest man is to attempt to refute the claim, which is tantamount to trying to refute Apollo, and would also strike an Athenian as blasphemous. There's also the matter of his daimon, which is usually taken to be evidence of some religiosity in Socrates, but a close look at how the dialogues portray the daimon with Socrates' claim that all he really knows is erotics, suggests that the daimon is nothing more than a polite expression of his philosophical erotics cf. Symposium's discussion of eros as daimonic, or as a daimon, Phaedrus' discussion of eros and Socrates' alluding to the daimon, and the Theages where Socrates juxtaposes the two at the beginning of the dialogue.If one takes Socrates's claims about philosophy seriously in his characterization of it as erotics, that is, the wisdom that one is impoverished with respect to wisdom and pursues it none the less, than he can be taken to be a hard agnostic, finding the gods to be questionable.
To respond more directly to the OP, he probably would've thought it politically useful for maintaining a certain sense of virtue among peoples, and perhaps restraining or moderating ambitious men, all provided it didn't try to destroy philosophy outright, in which case, he would probably agree with Nietzsche's tactics in trying to rid politics of its influence, including Nietzsche's attack on his own "noble lies".
I am glad there are still people like you on /lit/. Thanks anon.
doesn't socrates suggest something like that in the republic though? that it is better to be just to your enemies instead of unjust because that will not make them healthier it will only makes thigns worse
I saw Socrates at a grocery store in Los Angeles. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and engage him in elenctic method or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be just and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

what books do i have to read to be an e/lit/ist? pic related, it's me and the book I've had on my bookshelf for two years but never have touched. but once when i was tripping on 12g of shrooms i thought dfw was myself and i was god and infinite jest was actually existence distilled into novel form. should i ever actually read the damn thing?
Reddit burnouts, everybodyround of applause
Yeah, read it.There's a sticky if you wanna be an e/lit/ist though.
i had a professor once tell me that nobody will truly appreciate infinite jest until they've seriously contemplated suicide.
As part of a greater plan to completely change everything about my shitty life I will be traveling more.I'm going to Dublin from June 14 to June 19 for Bloomsday celebrations.I have read Ulysses but am hardly capable of discussing it at length. I figure I can still have fun looking at the really dedicated participants and take some photos.I wouldn't mind having a beer with a fellow patrician from /lit/, though.Or maybe one of you knows some nice places in Dublin to visit and/or shoot that aren't too touristy?Have there been /lit/ Bloomsday meetups in the past?
I live in Dublin and know a lot of lit fags.Most nice places in Dublin aren't too touristy, if you're into Lit I'd recommend the James Joyce centre, otherwise the only attractions are the 2 main large streets O'Connel and GraftonOn Bloomsday the James Joyce centre usually has a pub crawl where a load of well read people get smashed all day and visit various Ulysses locations. I'll probably be at that if you want some /lit/ people.
Is it true you guys piss all over the blarney stone and then lel at tourists?
I've never been to it personally but like, I can't really see it not happening sometimes, we have a lot of drunks.
, 
Well /lit/?
Whoever asked the question knew the fucking answer, they just wanted affirmation.Besides that, this is definitely true.
How many fecking bible threads do you need to have at a timeEven your dubs smell
For the most part people stay in democracy because it makes them feel good. Any part of government that challenges that comfort is either ignored or explained away with some bullshit excuses like " It's not perfect but it's the best we've got" or " It's for our security". This is not limited to America, most Democracies do this.
What are some examples of the Bible where Jesus advocates stoning people?
You heard it here first! Jesus was against getting stoned! Marijuana is devil's work!
Stoning is reasonable in an age before prisons. Hangings and beheadings are shit, because they reinforce the feeling of the state as Other.
Christianity is a mushroom cult though, and 'finding God' means tripping balls.
Yeah dude! Stoning is fun for the whole family! Everyone gets to trow a stone and have some fun as a community while keeping criminals at bay!
Doesn't the Bible just refer to stoning as a reasonable punishment because there weren't any other methods to punish people? As in, if the Bible says 'this is punishable by stoning', it doesn't necessarily mean that we should still literally stone somebody that does the thing but still punish them? I think a lot of the 'law' books have punishments that were appropriate for the time but are now archaic.
Mushrooms look like penises. It is all about sex baby!
He's not speaking in complete paragraphs.You've saved this to your computer?

Doesn't the Bible just refer to stoning as a reasonable punishment because there weren't any other methods to punish people? As in, if the Bible says 'this is punishable by stoning', it doesn't necessarily mean that we should still literally stone somebody that does the thing but still punish them? I think a lot of the 'law' books have punishments that were appropriate for the time but are now archaic.Stoning was supposed to shed no blood, and if you look into the OT, God considers blood to be holy, especially human blood, so stoning would not shed any of this holy juice in a way
The community should participate in punishment where practical. Stoning is no longer practical, but it was then. This makes the entire process of crime and punishment part of the community's interest and solidarity, rather than some terrifying behemoth lording over the community.
What about the stoning? Jesus is pretty clear on the matter:"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her."
automation in stoning puts all the stoners out of workThe face of capitalism can be ugly
implying I feel good knowing my soul is eternally damnedimplying I feel good knowing that I'm already dead and this is hellThere is no other explanation other than the life that I'm experiencing right now is actually just punishment for the life I've lived before. I mean, in no sensible, non-punishment-based existence would I have to suffer through reading such a stupid fucking opinion. On top of that, it's an opinion with zero logical base. I've come to the conclusion that even though there are probably millions of parallel existences filled with murderers and rapists burning and experiencing blood-curdling torture, this particular purgation of continuously having to read brain cancer levels of cranial pain inducing statements like that post is worse than all of them.
Since when do stoners work?
And magic is not really which means... Nothing is real... How can mirrors be real if our eyes ain't real?JADEN KNEW EVERYTHING ALL ALONG!

reasonableDeutoronomy 22.23 -24Also God kills everyone on the planet
I think a lot of religions were appropriate for the time but are now archaicThat's what you meant to say
litterally reddit
Deutoronomy is Jews, not Christfriends.
Explain
Yep, that's reasonable for an ancient society that was based on the extended extended extended family. Unless you want a feud on your hands.the floodNobody but fundamentalists believes that actually happened, at least as the Bible tells it.
Are you gonna cry? Please cry. Pleeeaaase. But before that, you could breathe deeply while typing another great comment that will stop shitposting completely just like this one did.
The Jewish laws the old covenant don't apply to Christians, because Jesus dissolved that shit and instituted the New Covenant.It's why Christians don't cut their dicks off, eat pork, etc.
Deutronomy is old covenant. The new covenant is about a prophecy in Isaih, which entails the Messiah, the Prince of Peace, God, being born of a virgin and being put to death for humanity's sins. That act allows for a new covenant which isn't just for Jews, but all nations, and which has a new law not written on scrolls, but on "the hearts of men". Christians consider themselves a part of this new covenant, not the old one, and Paul says if you get circumcised by your own will, you are signing the old covenant and forfeiting your part in the new one Christ made.
Well, duh.
genocide is reasonableUnbelievable, why are christians so unchristian?
That's nice, so Deutronomy isn't part of the bible?
Whether it's "part of the bible" or not is irrelevant. The Christian faith is based on the New Testament.
stoning is genocideI'm not even Christian and I disagree with you. The irony is that you're using a Christian morality to criticize the pre-Christian part of the book which ultimately led to your holding such views.
Wow incredible hedging, you have to own all of it if you're a christian, and you can't, so you invent bullshit to justify the uncomfortable stuff.  You believe in an imaginary friend and you should die and go to heaven
you have to own all of it if you're a christian,According to whom? The oldest churches certainly don't believe this. The idea you're referencing is in fact a relatively recent invention. It seems most nonbelievers are actually fundamentalists without the belief in God, because you people think rural American Protestantism is the end all be all of Christian theology.
Jesus fucking Christ.None of Genesis happened. The Exodus never happened, and Moses may or may not have existed but he sure as shit never wrote the torah. None of Joshua or Judges happened - Israelite society emerged peacefully from Canaanites. Deuteronomy was "discovered" by King Josiah in order to promote a version of yhwh worship where Jerusalem was the only acceptable place for sacrifice. David and Solomon probably existed but they were nothing like their biblical counterparts. The list of people in Kings is fairly accurate but it's theology disguised as history.Jesus was a failed apocalyptic prophet who got himself crucified and his followers hallucinated his return. The gospels are based on oral stories that were written down something like 30-60 years after his death, and they all present different conceptions of Jesus.Paul never met Jesus and got all of his information from a vision. The original apostles who actually met Jesus hated him and thought his abolishment of Jewish law was bullshit.Revelation is about Rome and Nero Caesar.There you go.
It is, but it's not a part that Christians have to worry about following.
The original apostles who actually met Jesus hated him and thought his abolishment of Jewish law was bullshit.Elaborate?
How does one stone someone to death and not shed blood?
'It's not perfect...' is more than what most Christians are willing to admit about their religion.Besides it isn't that easy to just leave democracy. There's pros and cons and I personally have thought critically about Democracy before.It's also different to just accept the government and ruling powers as they are, than to believe in something with all your heart.

Seeing as letter randomizing programs could effectively come up with the same thing after enough tries, what's so special about the classics?
They got it right on the first shot. Winning the lottery is special to the lottery winner, but statistically, somebody has to win.
plot, historical moment human history, etc.i'm not sure what you even mean by saying that they aren't special because hypothetically a program could eventually maybe come up with an identical thing. it would have made millions of other unidentical things in the process. whereas the author has intentionality
This isn't even true mathematically speaking.
okay fine, letter/capitalization/punctuation/formatting randomizers
Thats not what I'm saying. From wikipedia: The relevance of the theorem is questionable—the probability of a universe full of monkeys typing a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low but technically not zero.
The time period necessary to ensure a random generator would produce a complete work is an an infinity so vast that human contemplation of it is pointless. This infinite monkey shit is parroted because its pithy and cute, but its not actually insightful, really. You can rephrase it as "with enough time, everything will happen." Which is a lot less profound and catchy, and has little to no relevance to the realities of creation/art.
Shakespeare himself was illiterate, he would shut his eyes and scribble around on some paper and got really lucky a few times.
Post some of your prose and let others critique it, /lit/. I'd like to see what some of our budding writers on this board potentially have.
Imagine being Arnold in that scene and having to be all like "damn, Jamie Curtis, you fuckin' fine, all sexy with your tight body and horrific androgynous monster face. I would totally have sex with you, both my character and the real me." when all he really wants to do is fuck another 16 year old in his dressing room. Like seriously imagine having to be Arnold and not only sit in that chair while Jamie Lee Curtis flaunts her disgusting body in front of you, the favorable lighting barely concealing her stretchmarks and leathery skin, and just sit there, take after take, hour after hour, while she perfected that dance. Not only having to tolerate her monstrous fucking visage but her haughty attitude as everyone on set tells her she's STILL GOT IT and DAMN, JAMIE LEE CURTIS LOOKS LIKE *THAT*?? because they're not the ones who have to sit there and watch her mannish fucking gremlin face contort into types of grimaces you didn't even know existed before that day. You've been fucking nothing but a healthy diet of blondes and supermodels and later alleged rape victims for your ENTIRE CAREER coming straight out of the boonies in Austria. You've never even seen anything this fucking disgusting before, and now you swear you can taste the sweat that's breaking out on her dimpled stomach as she sucks it in to writhe it suggestively at you, smugly assured that you are enjoying the opportunity to get paid to sit there and revel in her "statuesque for that is what she calls herself" beauty, the beauty she worked so hard for with personal trainers in the previous months. And then the director calls for another take, and you know you could kill every single person in this room before the studio security could put you down, but you sit there and endure, because you're fucking Arnold. You're not going to lose your future political career over this. Just bear it. Hide your face and bear it.
He heard her distant speech from the office corridor; water vapour's laughter. Almost a whisper, graciously featherweight. Intentional or not, it was honest. Sugar paper wrapping an audible gift: such low decibel rating, more than enough to cause tinnitus. Nothing was ever forced, just slightly tapped. An incorruptible piece of audio not unlike a recently purchased cassette with an eternal promise establishing a rule for never playing it; you wouldn't want to damage such a beautiful sound.Naaaah, no, that's not. Wait. Her hair's a modest gradient - brown soil foundations allowed marvellous blonde establishments to grow and prosper, as many aspire for the success that her hair had achieved. Goddamn, wow. She seemed preoccupied, mid-discussion regarding some professional concerns - water cooler jargon for getting asses in gear because that shit wasn't ever going to record itself Oh god, you know how these artists are: "Hey, can I record this new solo I've been working on?" Well how about fuck off, no, it isn't exactly fucking November Rain. Just finish the fucking song, we want to go home, you self-indulgent rats. Despite concerns, stresses and depresses, she would seemingly give various timezones, annual celebratory holiday information and the variables that contribute to the variations of seasons' length and timing throughout each year. Surprisingly, she probably could. Those glasses. Whoa, Nelly. His libido would pull them off with his teeth; his libido this and that, a few lustful thoughts popped into mind -- fuck off, fuck off, fuck off, fuck off, fuck off, fuck off. I cannot believe I let that happen. Despite natural urge; the drill sergeant pushing forward, hoping his training of the soldiers had motivated them enough to succeed and survive the battlefield - probably Normandy, all the marching - against the foe. The Cold War scum suckers who wanted to fuck their freedom and cum in its hair, motherfuckers! They'd fuck their own mothers! The hun cunts and the Russkie shits, right, right, right, huh? ACHTUNG, I'LL SEE THE DEATH OF YOU BEFORE YOU RISE ONCE MORE.He turned his back from her general direction to hide the uprising. It seemed not just the revolt against Communism, but he was hiding the tearing of the Berlin wall and possibly the French Revolution too on second thought, most likely the French had something to do with it all. The studio was empty, right? Thundered, thundered, foot soldier march! I don't know what I've been told, What we have here is Cuban missile gold!
I was so mad at my Mom and Dad I punched my wall like *BANG*, like a boxer hitting a heavy bag. I didn't even care if I hit a stud or something. I hit just plain drywall though and punched through it like *BANG* you know? I was so tired of them always yelling at me and telling me how stupid I am. My Dad used to smack my head like I was a moron when I messed up at something that I wouldn't even know how to do anyway. It was my chore to sweep up the kitchen but getting around the table was a pain so I just pushed the chairs and stuff over and Mom yelled at me "what's wrong with you!". Dad came in and said "what is going on here jesus christ Ben what is it now". I didn't even throw the chairs I just pushed them out of the way cause they told me to sweep and the kitchen was fucking clean anyway. I had to stand there while they kept yelling but they told me to go to my room and I didn't have to finish. My wall has a lot of holes in it but I don't hit the ones by my bed anymore. They face outside and in the winter it gets cold around where the holes. I asked for a TV for my birthday but my parents got me a CD.

Well a mixed economic system is best as history has shown. But what really gets me is Marx's prose. He's a pretty bad writer
mfw some /lit/dditor told me to start with the Greeks
Marx says humans can fly by themselves. Without planes.
Does he also say humans can organize industry "by themselves", without machines?
he hasn't read Marxhow embarassing
mfw some nerginal /lit/erati tells me to actually read the books I'm discussing
perfect description of communism if you ask metell somebody to jump of a cliff, because they can flydidn't worked, broke both legsnext time try jumping from a different cliff

The hand glider is captalism.
The hand glider is an instrument, just like the plane. Some people flew planes in buildings because they were cunts. Mistakes were made.
crashing a plane is a great analogy for Stalin's terror. dude went bonkers
i kno
Funny you should say that because neoliberalism asserts precisely that we don't need any hand gliders, just let the market do everything i.e. our bodies will fly by themselves if we just stop regulating them with external tools.Of course they don't say exactly that, but to apply that analogy to Marx is even more absurd.
Neoliberalism actually says labor contributes nothing of value, so it kind of does say that.. The only point for labor neoliberalism is as a form of prayer to market, so if you don't do well you can be reprimanded for lack of sufficient piety, as Job was by his fellows.
Yeah but the utility from microeconomics is pure bullshit. They want to mantain the level of utility of things through the market but it's even much more vague than the labor theory itself.
If you think trying with new communism is crashing, what do you think capitalism is doing? Every few years when the whole economy crashes and everyone is extremely fucked financially. And then it has a butterfly effect across the whole world. The whole world is fucked because a few faggots want to make more money than everybody else. Then they just change the way they fuck everybody until it crashes again. But yeah, leftists are the ones who are stupid for trying to make a change.
Yes the are stupid, they will drag everyone into the mud with them
What a well presented argument!
Thanks.

Why the fuck are Cambridge books so expensive? Oxford books are usually like $10-20 while Cambridge books are like $80+ minimumIts especially apparent with history booksOxford :http://www.amazon.com/Oxford-History-Greece-Hellenistic-World/dp/0192801376Cambridge : http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0521228042/ref=mp_s_a_1_13?qid=1433091619&sr=8-13&pi=AC_SX110_SY165&keywords=cambridge+ancient+history
because oxford is garbage for the poor unwashed massesthat is to say, pretty well suited for the likes of you
you need to buy overpriced books to not be a plebLeave. Your presence is lowering the intelligence of this whole board
Is there really that much content to write about between the years 525-479 BC? 946 pages? really?
Oxford is the cool guy who all the chicks dig, he's smart; cool and hip; attractive but humble; and he doesn't give a damn what doc thinks. Cambridge is just that nerdy kid who sits in the canteen on his own, and pretends to be on his phone when he walks past people.
use libgenheres your cambridge book:http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=DA84B6DD58179B4247CDCC581D285766
Cambridgian spotted i guess?
Ugh, yes, I wish they were much more reasonably priced. I'd love to get the series on the Middle Ages. I suppose $60/book in paperback for that set still isn't outrageous.
libgen has most of them too, unless you mean you want paperbacks
People have written books about single events... 946 pages on a few decades is a brief summary compared to that.
Speaking of overpriced books, how is the Cambridge Companion series? I was actually thinking of picking up the companions to Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon.

I'm no professional book reviewer, but I feel like I wasted my life reading the 640 pages of this great writer:Little to no action. More than half the book is filler. The Burdovsky affair, Hippolit's text, the whole past behind the Prince's father, Ivolguin's drunkard stories and more don't go anywhere and don't contribute to the main dynamic of the book, which is the prince, Rogójin and Nastácia.Many characters with little to no differential traits that we have to remember for their names and that are actually irrelevant for the final outcome of the book. Like Keller, Prince Sch., Burdovsky, Fierdischenko, Adelaida and the other sister of Aglaia whose name I already forgot. The only useful cast of the book are: the Prince, Rogójin, Aglaia, Liébediev, Lisavieta and her husband; and Nastacia.The whole part II of the novel is filler after chapter 3 Prince has epilepsy after he's attacked by Rogójin and is sent to other city.The book is filled to the brink with exposition dialogue to good scenes we actually don't see and that happen between Part I and Part II or before the Prince arrived in Moscow.The best and most reflective parts of the novel are not in the novel. The Prince narrating the fear of death and the clinging to life in Part I, the reflection about men of action and men of words in the beginning of part III, etc. When the best thing in a novel isn't part of the plot itself, you know something is really wrong.Anyone agree with me?
And by the way, the ending kind of is enthralling. But it's only explained by the fact the Prince if surrounded by crazy people and doesn't leave them. Which is really sad and totally hits the pit that Dostoievsky wanted when confronting a Jesus-Quixote character with the darkest of the people the darkness being represented by the dark house of Rogójin, but really: the ending is not worth it.What other books from Dostoievsky can you suggest me after I picked the rotten apple in the bag?
I agree, I love every other book by Feodor that I have read but this was just bullshit.
The story about the guy on death row is god tier, but as you said a lot of it is unnecessary.
Yeah, holy shit.I wish the book was that scene. Everytime I go to school, I feel like I'm that prisoner that is counting every street and every second of life before getting beheaded. It was GOD tier.But why couldn't we have more of that and less of the unecessary filler soup that is the whole novel specially Part II?
Little to no actionI stopped there. Go watch Avengers or something kid.
Did anyone say filler?
did anybody say filler
It's not action in the sense of movement. I was expected a plot. And what I received was a plot filled with plots that lead to nothing and barely influenced it, with a few ACTUAL scenes for redemption.Just check Part II. I beg you. Just give it a good read after the Prince is sent to Pavlovsky and the Burdovsky's gang appears. The only thing that whole part added to the rest of the novels was more names to remember from characters who had no influence to the entire story.
Did anybody say Filler...?I swear I heard it.
Are you me OP? Agree x100.Go for Crime & Punishment to restore your faith & then Notes from the Underground.

I'm newish to reading and I'd like to get into Thomas Pynchon, though I've heard his works are quite daunting. Is inherent vice a good place to start? What after?
 crying lot of 49 or v. are the usual starting point/lit/ recomends
Read the published novel first, the proofs are only for real Pynchon fans like me
I'd say ignore the guide and start with Mason & Dixon, it's his most human novel but dense enough to familiarise you with his work.But it is double the length of Inherent Vice, so it will take you a little longer to read.
I actually disagree with v as a starting point. It's almost as esoteric as GR at times. I started with inherent vice and i thought it was a great introduction. Made me excited to read more pynchon. Don't really understand why people deem it 'pynchon-lite' either. Alternatively, lot 49 would be a great starting point, probably an even better one than IV.
Inherent Vice was a great read, I came in after seeing the film, so there's that. Haven't read any other Pynchon yet though.
I understand that people who come here for guidance are simply looking to draw on some first hand experience, but the answer to questions such as Op's is always to research the books yourself, which is easy to do, and read whichever one appeals to you the most. Enthusiasm will carry you far enough through whichever book you settle on to hopefully work whether or not you can enjoy Pynchon generally. You'll find people who started out with Gravity's Rainbow and loved it, and the same for Inherent Vice, M&D etc. Pick one, dive in and have fun.
Gotta agree with this guy, here. I personally started with Gravity's Rainbow, OP, despite most of /lit/ would recommend reading V. first before tackling GR. I still enjoyed it, albeit I found it challenging but it felt highly rewarding which was something I hadn't experienced from a writer as much as I had with Pynchon.
Are there /lit/ guides to authors besides King and Pinecone?
Besides the difficulty, starting with V. would've been better because Gravity's Rainbow revisits many of the themes, some of the characters, and some events from V.
I do plan on revisiting GR after reading V. in an attempt to appreciate that. I know there's certainly details I wouldn't have necessarily picked up on, but I was really only just supporting the other anon's post in saying "just start where it interests you the most."
We should have these best-editions lists for every book.What's the best edition of 1984?
just stickying this image would halve the number of threads made on /lit/
doubleit's at least 4 times the length if IV
IV is 369 pages, M&D is 773, the typeface in M&D is marginally smaller and there is less line-spacing.So I will concede that it's probably got about 2.75x the words in it.
ignore the guide and start with gravity's rainbow i seriosuly don't see any reason not toinherent vice is manageable because it's not very good. just go for his good stuff or hold off a while and come back when you're a better readerif you really wanna start with something easy by him try lot49
Start with his most challenging book because if you can't get it then you don't deserve to read his less challenging workAbsolutely terrible advice, people can feel free to start anywhere they want.
I made this as a joke.
What's the deal with the upside-down badger in the corner?
i woulr recommend bleeding edge, not his best book but easy to get a hang of his style and type of comedy before plunging into GR or M&D
I hadn't noticed that, top kek.It's a spoiler and it would be a waste of time explaining it.
Oh come on. I've read his first three books+Inherent Vice.pls splain
Well clearly you never read his first three books well enough. In that case.

that's the joke
not what I mean, I mean his easy books just aren't very good.
Then you're basically saying V., Against the Day and Gravity's Rainbow are his only good books.
basically. except i actually mean v, gr and mason and dixon. and lot 49 is pretty good too.didn't care for against the day at all, really.

Distopian themes such as the Hunger Games and renewed popularity of such works as 1984 and Brave New World are a greater part of popular culture, though that's pretty obvious.
“Society is elitist,” says Lacan. The characteristic theme of de Selby’s model of dialectic discourse is the meaninglessness, and some would say the economy, of subcapitalist sexual identity. It could be said that Foucault suggests the use of Sartreist absurdity to attack capitalism.In the works of Madonna, a predominant concept is the distinction between masculine and feminine. If textual discourse holds, we have to choose between dialectic postsemanticist theory and textual Marxism. However, Parry implies that the works of Madonna are reminiscent of Tarantino.Sartre uses the term ‘textual discourse’ to denote a mythopoetical paradox. It could be said that Marx’s essay on Sartreist absurdity states that the purpose of the writer is deconstruction.If Marxism holds, we have to choose between the dialectic paradigm of reality and subtextual capitalist theory. In a sense, the premise of Marxism implies that consensus must come from the collective unconscious.Finnis suggests that we have to choose between textual discourse and posttextual feminism. But Foucault’s model of Marxism states that government is capable of truth.“Class is part of the stasis of art,” says Lyotard; however, according to Dahmus, it is not so much class that is part of the stasis of art, but rather the collapse, and subsequent genre, of class. If modern precultural theory holds, we have to choose between Sartreist absurdity and dialectic discourse. It could be said that many situationisms concerning textual discourse may be found.In the works of Rushdie, a predominant concept is the concept of subpatriarchialist reality. Lacan uses the term ‘Marxism’ to denote the role of the poet as artist. Thus, the subject is interpolated into a Sartreist absurdity that includes consciousness as a totality.Marx promotes the use of Marxism to modify society. It could be said that the subject is contextualised into a Sartreist absurdity that includes narrativity as a whole.Lacan suggests the use of the capitalist paradigm of consensus to deconstruct sexism. However, Lyotard uses the term ‘Marxism’ to denote not discourse, but neodiscourse.The subject is interpolated into a Sartreist absurdity that includes consciousness as a totality. It could be said that Lacan promotes the use of Marxism to read and analyse class.

Are books as Ulysses, infinite jest or Inherent vice too much for a non englishman? I can speak and read englisch tho but those reads might be too hard. You know!
Non English man as well and tried reading books in English and I read like 10 pages an hour and don't understand a thing. Fuck this, I now get the translated ones. Unless you're reading poetry, you're fine.
They're quite plainly full of obscure and irrelevant words, you'll be missing roots for portmanteaus and imagined vocabularies, and most importantly, you'll loose a lot of things you need a degree of cultural inundation to understand.Taking IJ for an example, some parts will be fairly lucid and easy to digest, while other you'll be slogging through chapters, wondering why Wardine be cry and why I yrstruly and C are not 2Bdenied from old Wo's subservant slopes serving skeet because C's mucis is running bad and he boosted foregn students all nigt to cop dope for x-mas that hurts like dranoTo be fair, a lot of English speakers can struggle with this too. If you can remove the extraneous and maybe get some help with the Ebonics-influenced chapters, you'll be fine.

how come?i couldn't see a future where i would be happy having my independent efforts directed and controlled by a professor and the GPA systemWhy would a degree stop you from doing independent research outside of school? What can a professor do if the information you present is legitimate? Imo, university is a great way to challenge your own opinions and knowledge and motivate you to become more productive.

I do not follow your rant.first, if you see the academic study as a production of some résumé to show your employer, then you must undestand that you must acquire a higher degree than the average. For STEM, it means doctorate. Today, the masters are the norm, just like the license was trendy a decade ago, just like the A-level was enough before.Secondly, if you wish to go to uni for a job, you must build a network. Reminder that the proper order of what matters to find employment isskillzdegreenetworkIt means basically, that you must go to oxbridge where you buy the network of the alumnis.The prestige of the university means more opportunity, means less work on your side to get these opportunities.You have better connections, better entries to what you want, you are more aware of the post-uni world.

I have no idea why people buy so many books. I get a 40% discount on books at my work and I still don't buy them. Partially because I don't need them but also because they take up a ton of space. I just don't get why people who want to read a lot don't go to their local university library/public library. You can get anything through them that you can get at a bookstore.

How can we revive journalism?
Have you ever heard of native advertisement?This is the golden era of journalism.
Journalism is shit, I hope it dies.
Declaration of principles.
It killed itself
What dont you like about it?Not really
was journalism ever good for a society
What dont you like about it?I dislike things that make me feel bad that I am powerless and/or unwilling to change.
Isn't journalism stronger than ever? People are writing whatever shit comes into their head on every subject imaginable
Journalism today is in the hands of postmodernist a who makes shitty click bait articles about white privilege
No, because of this That makes sense, at least a littleI would say so. The author documents and investigates, and the reader learns a considerable amount, especially when the journalist is entertaining and can write well. Although most people will do nothing with the information learned, like the anon above said, it at least widens their perspective.
Never been so little fact checking in mainstream media, and non-mainstream media are just a more rabid version of their bigger clickbait cousins.Investigate? This is the era of canned statements and hasty copy-paste.When a target is defenseless more and more journalists in the West outright make things up because they benefit from legal immunity.Politician friends: nothing new, but there isn't any less of it.
You ever visit longform.org, OP? Some pretty good stuff on there.

What's the use of journalism?
To inform, preserve, and describe. What a silly question.
Newspapers are the second hand of history. This hand, however, is usually not only of inferior metal to the other hands, it also seldom works properly.
Shut down sites like Huffpo, Slate, and Salon, and shoot them in the back of the head like the Francoists did to Lorca. Shut down all tabloids and systematically send all the contributors to gulags.
Newspapers do not constitute all of Journalism. Check mate.True.
Professional reporter herelel1. The whole 'golden age of journalism' thing is a myth. It was always flawed in most of the same ways it is now and it used to be much worse in other ways.2. Good journalism is really difficult and there aren't many people who want to read it or pay someone to write it3. The most obvious flaws with journalism are problems inherent in the way people perceive reality, and the way institutions work to preserve their own power There is no obvious way around it.4. The people who bitch the most about 'the mainstream media' are generally the least informed about what is in the news and how the news gets reported5. The western 'objective journalism' model is probably the best one available, but is also clearly flawed beyond repair in multiple ways6. A story that steps on anyone's toes will almost always require access from someones with an axe to grind and/or nothing to lose7. The collapse of the print business model means the work is being done by less experienced reporters for less money. They are less able to put events in proper context and less able to avoid getting played by sources.8. The collapse of the print business model has shifted the remaining jobs online and towards the coasts. The death of local coverage, where institutions are less sophisticated and have the biggest immediate impact on the lives of average people, means the news is less relevant to people's lives10. Less relevant news to report means more clickbait trash and generalized coverage done by reporters who conduct interviews over e-mail and aren't members of the communities whose stories they are trying to tell 11. More and more of the stories you get told are written by and about the NYC/Washington/San Fran/LA communities where national journos live, or by the few remaining quality big city papers sprinkled throughout the country.12. Most peoples solution to these problems are some form of just cut corners and fudge stories about important issues in a way that reflects your understanding of the deeper truth in a way that traditional reporting can never capture.Most people who try this are too obviously full of shit and/or don't write well enough to take over the job novelists have been doing for hundreds of years. That being said, the piece of reporting that stuck with me the most recently was the Sy Hersh OBL piece which was almost totally sourced anonymously and widely condemned by the mainstream 'objective' press, yet it left me feeling that the story was probably 80% true, but it will never be really 'proven' and I will never know exactly which 80% he was right about. Of course Hersch is a good writer with real credibility earned over a half century of work. For every one of him there are a million clowns making a fool out of themselves.
Thank you also.
I've never really looked at Scientology with a serious eye, but this Tom Cruise video has really got me thinking. I am starting to read Dianetics. What do you think of the video and the church?I think it's a privilege to call yourself a Scientologist and it is something that you have to earn, and... because a Scientologist does. He, or she has the ability to create new and better realities and improve conditions.  And, you know, I'm there to help, and we're here to help, and my opinion is is that, look, either you're on board or you're not on board. Okay, it's just, if you're on board, you're on board just like the rest of us. Period.It is the time now. Now is the time, okay? It is, being a Scientologist, people are turning to you, so you better know it. You better know it, and if you don't, you know, go learn it.
Brah, go look for your ideology somewhere else. We don't want your spooks here.
shilling this hard
mfw the church spends literally centuries to improve its narrative where in the end all they had to do was pick some famous fagbait and make him say ambiguous statements in front of the populacewell I guess scientology is happy with a smaller number of believers than the church.
Dianetics doesn't have that much to do with what Scientology became. It's basically workingman's Freudian psychology.
Here you go, Alice. Don't get hurt. https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Category:Scientology
are there any writers that were happy and lived healthy fulfilling lives? a lot of the great writers seem like they were complete losers IRL. is this inherent in being reflective all the time and focusing on the hard-to-communicate mysteries of being human? also what separates a writer from an intelligent capable person that doesn't feel the need to write?
Huxley had a good and fulfilling life.

Shit anime paired with god-tier bookIs Cervantes the Yung Lean of Spanish Lit
Best book I've ever read.
It's my favourite book
Why, despite the internet, freely available knowledge, eliminating the barrier to entry an expensive, 'worthless' college education, is high culture more demonized than ever? To label something as 'elitist' suggests that the common folk do not have A access and B the ability to comprehend. So not only are elitist claims, in 2015, false, they are an insult to the very masses the claimants love to champion and defend.Prime example: Jonathan Franzen wrote an article in favor of taste and against social media and people, the journalists/bloggers who cover film, lit, music, etc., lost their minds. article is now offline.
I see accusations of pretension more than accusations of elitism when it comes to "highbrow" stuff.
The masses subconsciously sense the danger knowledge brings and protects the survival of the species by anything that will bring us closer to impotent nihilism, i.e. it's a survival feature officially termed problemata plebicanus.
Because despite all that society will always have peasants.
Is the Franzen article you're talking about recent? I know he's got a history of writing articles that piss people off. I think this is partly due to people disliking Franzen, though. His article Mr. Difficult was a load of ass, though. Ben Marcus's response was pretty great. article is now offlinelmao implying thats possible in 2015
despite the internetdespiteWith Internet you have way easier and unlimited access to junk entertainment and ability for that entertainment to fill your whole free time.But when people are stuck with a few books in some place without Internet they will be able to put some effort into it, at least if they're not too spoiled yet.
Because only one barrier expense has been eliminated. You also have:1Time - even if you aren't spending 4+ years doing nothing but studying, you've got to find time to put into gathering and processing all the available knowledge. This isn't easy for most people to do unless they mostly toss out other non-work pursuits.2Inclination - not just the 'it'd be nice to know' impulse that so many undereducated people have but the sense of near moral obligation to spend time investigating something. That might be too strongly phrased, but I'm driving at the idea of knowledge as non-material wealth that is far harder for an individual to discover and cultivate than to inherit from parents and surroundings.3Effort - even with the above, most people are lazy. And for all the knowledge the internet provides it also offers as many distractions that are far less difficult and far more appealing, especially after a hard day of work, than sitting down with a grammar and dictionary to learn French so you can slowly read Proust in the original as any civilized human should do.

Secondly the only reason to read a work in its own language is because you want to feel the emotions as the author intended . If you wre a true intellectual you could bridge this gap by insight and if you were a non posing intellectual you wouldn't read to feel emotions.
it's sad that you don't realize how much bullshit you're spouting
I think you're overestimating the public's ability to comprehend the materials. *Especially* in light of easy accessibility, the public expects the subjects to be easily summarized, which they of course aren't always.
Familiarity breeds contempt, OP.When most academic material was inaccessible to the masses, it was easy for the common man to imagine that education was an almost mystical thing that revealed the deepest cosmic truth to its initiates. A man who held a doctorate was something akin to a modern-day wizard; a possessor of secret teachings that command respect.Now that anyone can get a look at the works of classical philosophy and see that for the most part there's nothing all that special about it, they're more likely to resent those who try to claim greater authority or social status because of education.
Educate me then .
most people aren't very smart. this realization will simplify many things for you.

Hi lit, I shared here some time ago a scan i made of pic related and I was wondering if maybe Anon still has it? I lost it and theres only an epub on libgen...

Is this it?http://www.mediafire.com/download/kqgw6jklk72g9ai/OD-NLH.rarBut yes, can't imagine why you'd want a PDF when an epub is available. You'd probably get a better PDF from converting the epub?

is the monomyth real?
Are constellations real? Are they useful as meaningful symbols? Will everyone interact with every constellation in a symbolic or mythical sense?
It's a common narrative structure, but obviously individual stories adhere more loosely or rigidly to it.
No.. that's why it's called a myth, dingus.
Not every myth follows this pattern, take the biblical Jesus as an example.
implying the biblical Jesus is a mythtop kek
Indifferent of religious meaning, the biblical Jesus isn't a historical document either.So in a comparative mythology point of view, yes, it's a myth.Another example, a modern myth, The Superman. He doesn't fulfill this monomyth journey. he had born with no fear of death, with his supernatural powers, he didn't needed a journey to become what he is.My point is, there are many possibilities of myths outside Campbell's scheme.
implying it isn't
I don't think so.I read The Hero of a Thousand Faces and found it very unconvincing. I wanted to buy it, but he kept stretching his schemes to such an unreasonable length to fit them with everything.No doubt he does pick out some tendencies, but imo it seems obvious there should be patterns to discover, though I'm pretty sure they have little do with any kind of supernatural connection between the souls of all humans which, Campbell being a Jungian, is what he's seriously arguing with his comparative studies.
Tolkien does not approve of your words, Anon.
I'd go a step further and say that there's often microcosmic monomythic stages within the larger, macrocosmic monomythBut it's a hero's quest, and doesn't happen to everyone Right now I'm deep within the trials, and, microcosmically just finishing woman as temptress Since October, when I was microcosmically meeting with the goddess, bringing it to life within this beautiful, alpha slut who her friends seemed to admire and who was known to treat other guys like shit, when it seemed I was with something like my female equivalent, all the while not realizing I was largely projecting these qualities on her, I've been in about 13 or so fights for reasons like paranoia, jealousy, finding myself, and because I may be crazy by some more-technical definitions. I feel a largely embody the modern, paranoid hero. So I'm experiencing the shittier of these stages atmliving in hotels that family, who, due to my difficulty to live with, no longer want me around, and is about done subsidising me, while I missed this past 2 weeks of work to be, and fight with the girl mentioned aboveI don't subscribe to eegalitarianism, but neither do I think that anything short of perfection and its opposite are one size fits allYou definitely have the opportunity to be a hero, and to go through your version of these stages
I mean I guess? It's real in the same sense that language is real or what you see in Rorsarch plots are real
The term monomyth denotes it encompassing the overal stages of hero myths, op is asking if it applies to real heroes as well
no it's fake and imaginary sorry
nope, monomyth is pseudo-science, androcentric and racist
cis white male discussing a bunch of myths from around the worldif that isn't enough he actually claims all myths are the sameugh, the cultural appropriation is just, UGH
confirmed for having never read a superman comic in his life
there are many possibilities of myths outside Campbell's scheme.of course there are.also it should be pointed out that superman isn't a myth at all
There are definitely a lot of things that do follow it. Mostly kids' stories. In fiction for adults, it's a serious flaw that leads to the story feeling formulaic and predictable.
It's just the most evident form of storytelling.There are more subtleties which can show you how to bend or break the rules of this narrative.
Does anyone know the difference content wise between these two books?
They are, as far as I know, both pretty lousy.The general consensus among Lovecraft scholars which I strongly agree with is that S.T. Joshi's editions of Lovecraft's work are the best. This is probably the best collection with that in mind, and I recommend it. Centipede Press does good shit.http://www.amazon.com/Lovecraft-Centipede-Press-Library-Fiction/dp/1613470487/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1433108020&sr=8-1&keywords=centipede+press+lovecraftPic related is also a good Lovecraft collection edited by Joshi
If it has the same stories and the same text, what makes one better than the other except for the introduction?
I will copy/paste an Amazon review which explains it to save time, if you'll pardon the laziness. The real question to ask about a collection of Lovecraft's work, though, is: what distinguishes it from all the other many Lovecraft collections out there? That is why I would give the Penguin collection 5 stars: the selection of stories is very good, arranged chronologically and covering the Lovecraft "hits," as well as some lesser-known earlier works. But what's most impressive about this anthology, as compared to others, is the superb annotation by S.T. Joshi, the premier Lovecraft scholar. There are ample footnotes to each of the stories, describing the backgrounds of the tales, discussing where Lovecraft got his ideas, pointing out thematic links, etc. These footnotes also provide insights into the life of Lovecraft himself, who apparently was not the weird recluse that one might initially suspect when reading his stories. In fact, Joshi includes many quotes from Lovecraft's correspondences, and some of these quotes are even very humorous one quote deals with Lovecraft's description of his attempts to make a vocal recording in the style of Enrico Caruso, the famous singer. That's why this Penguin collection of stories is so good: you get many classic Lovecraft stories, along with Joshi's illuminating commentaries and annotation.If you don't care about this, then you can make you own decision obviously
The annotations are interesting, because they also teach you about american society. E.g. it was only in the 60s that the timezones in the US became uniform. During Lovecraft's time, there was still local timezones.And the Joshi covers are spooky. Avoid at any cost the "Omnibus" editions with the eDgY covers.
What is the most complete compilation of Lovecraft's works?
Op here I ended up buying the left one and after reviewing the book it has A LOT of his story's in it, too many to count really and each story has a short intro with them. Ill take pics if anyone wants me to. To be honest I'm pretty satisfied for now I just didn't know the difference with the other one :^/

This looks like the tile of my bathroom in the house I grew up in. I've used them in a story, too. In third grade.
I had meant the ending of Hero of Ages, specifically, since not everyone knows the significance of Ruin and Preservation.Also it would probably make more sense for Adonalsium to be "put back together" but remember there is the group that opposes Adonalsium and they have a weapon created specifically for defeating Adonalsium, which may or may not still be in existence.
AdonalsiumWtf is that?

Seriously, if your narrow minds are only confined to books that you don't even enjoy, what is the point of reading? Don't tell me you actually think it makes you "smarter" because you regurgitate others thesis and interpretations of books and don't actually come up with your own.inb4 "I had just happened to have the same belief when I read it"
Google it?apparently there are 16 of the shards like Ruin and Preservation, they call came from some place called Adonalsium or something. I've only read the Mistborn books so I'm not sure how the others tie into it.
The end of Hero of Ages is the first instance in which Adonalsium was mentioned. Cosmere is his meta. Stormlight is the only other one so far in terms of importance in which its series is the most Cosmerically vital as of now.
This is me faggot  If I said came expecting a malazan threadDoesn't that mean I like fantasy and came in this thread to discuss it?I was just pointing out the shit pretentious e/lit/ist say.
Aren't the Shards suppose to join up to make a one true God?Wasn't it one being and when it was shattered his personalities/emotions shattered alongside it?
dubsbump
one true GodI'm more curious as to where you get your info from.Adonalsium wasn't a 'being' but we don't yet know if Adonalsium was man-made vs. natural, or if anyone was a 'Sliver' of Adonalsium.
Maybe I'm getting mixed up, but I remember when I started Warbreaker years ago, and was just getting into Sanderson. Their was talk about the shards being part of a whole/being or something to that extent ....I've read literally hundreds of fantasy books since then so.... maybe I'm mixing it up with something else?
No, that's right, but your first post was assumptuous.'God' would not be a term Adonalsium should be defined by.
Abusive father convinces schizo bastard son to an hero for love.
What would it be defined by?What is the most loose definition of a God?I'm sure with all the abilities each shard has shownespecially the one that affects only worms, who then allow birds to see the future, when they are combined that being/thing, would be a very power omnipotent bastard with the power to created life from nothing, and destroy whole civilizations .fantasy posts the bibleIf the bible is indeed fantasy, that means most of the world's population, millions if not billions, believes in magic and the practices it on a daily basisprays and chants empowers their magically God.This would also mean that the Christians are the biggest Hippocrates in the world. The killed thousands if not millions for believing or practicing in the occult.... while practicing it themselves....

The killed thousands if not millions for believing or practicing in the occult.... while practicing it themselves....Yes, I'm glad you understand.
I retract my previous statement.It's not a 'God' in the traditional Christian sense but it's easily 'Godlike'. However, remember that we do not know if Adonalsium is natural or artificialwe do not know if the opposition's weapon succeeded in whatever its purpose may have beenIIRC, the worm deal on First of the Sun was natural, and I do remember that there was no Shard on the planet at the time the story took place.Also remember that Shards affect their Shardholder's personality over time. A good example is Sazed who can barely act due to the opposing Shards combined into Harmony. If Adonalsium broke off different ways, different Shards would have been created.
Fantasy and genre fiction and all that shit is caused by Tumblr and Reddit.You heard it here first. Tolkien used Tumblr every day.
What if the completed shard was imbedded in a being?What then?
It seems like every single fantasy author is just ripping off Tolkien. Except maybe Gene Wolfe.
A grumpy edgelord smashes fox pussy and bitches about stuff.
What constitutes ripping off Tolkien? Is it the inclusion of magic, magical races, the use of a largely preindustrial society, or just any attempt to build a setting that isn't sci fi and isn't earth?
absolute dogshitspoiler; it's all of them
... It was the fox god who smashed pussy.... and i mean that in the literal sense of the word... her vag was no longer useable after that.
The genre is defined by the setting rather than the plot. That says it all.
'What ifs' are pointless in this scenario since there is still so much we do not know, and will not know for a while.
That chart is confusing as fuck, what would miss "awesomeness" fall under?
The chart isn't confusing. The large symbols are Orders and the smaller symbols are abilities. Every Order has two abilities.Lift is an Edgedancer.
So she has abrasion and progression?
Yes.Although her metabolization of Stormlight is unique to her. Probably from the Nightwatcher.
Wtf does progression mean? I just read the short story Sanderson put out about her.Abrasion has to do with her not sticking to things, what does progression mean?
http://coppermind.net/wiki/Surgebinding#Progressiontl;dr Healing
tl;dr HealingWhy not just say that.....The Surgebinder can even reverse death with Regrowth; a body that has bled out or a soul that has been severed with a Shardblade can be healed with Regrowth and continue to function as if it has never been damaged.Though once the soul leaves the body and reaches the afterlife, it is impossible for the Surgebinder to revive the person.So persons with burnt out pits for eyes can be revived? How long does it take for the soul to leave? Normal 3 days like other books?Also I want to fuck Jasnah badly..... her 30 year old virgin thighs are just begging to be spread....
Have you not read the books? We don't know much more beyond that as of yet. We don't even know much about the Spiritual Realm in general.
Any of you turbonerds ever read anything by this man? Thoughts?
I would like to, but I haven't gotten around to itZizek says he was wrong though, so I assume it's not a big deal. /ironyturbonerds
dfw you are always left out of philosophy threads because you only read fictionI'll s-start with the greeks eventually, right?
Zizek says he was wrong though,Does he expound on this substantially? Unger's perspective is so radically different from the more traditional thinkers like Badiou and Zizek that I'd be interested to see what he had to say, hoping that it amounts to more than "how undialectical", because there's a lot to discuss. Only start with the Greeks if you're confident in your ability to read with discipline. I started, but I'm too much of a procrastinator, so at my rate I would have never gotten to 20th century philosophy for a another 5 years, so I skipped to Hegel and Marx and proceeded from there.
not analytic philosophy/scienceDropped
are you serious? what book of hegel's did you start with?
Philosophy of History then Phenomenology of Spirit
He's right about analytic philosophy being terminated but just replacing it with science and completely neglecting letters is an awful idea.

Show us your Bibles, /lit/!Bonus good boy points for your favourite passage.
KJV
Oh and 23rd psalm
If you see this Bible rockin don't come a-knockin
Which edition?
Looks like an Anglo-Catholic one.
1st Thessalonians, or To The Thessalians A.As you can see, I've been trying to bridge Ancient History with the New Testament somewhat.
Continuing with The Epistle to the Thessalonians.
The second to last page regarding the Thessalonians.
Apparently the dynasty of Alexander was originally based in Athens, before overtaking Macedon? It's doubtful that they would have reintroduced the Attic dialect there however. There may have been some remnant of Aeolic in this area, but Koine must have predominated at this time.
Note that Thessalian and Thessalonians are two different groups. I definitely mean the latter in regard to this passage.
Note that Saint Paul, despite his humility, was very well educated in Tharsus. He didn't receive an over-extended education, but we can clearly detect the formal, ancient method of writing epistles in this work. For that reason, the headings are justified.We see in I that Paul is arranging the lines of his Exordium or Proemion.In II, he's Narrating events beginning at Phillippos.
As Paul concludes his narrative in Part II...He goes on in Part III to write of the literal partitioning of the missionary group after the Second Mission.In Part IV, Paul is Confirming them in the faith, by acknowledging their commitment.
Now Chapter IV wraps up by concluding Paul's Confirmatio.I would probably change the chapter headings somewhat here, as there's a tiny window where Paul makes a 'Refutatio of the Ignorant' which leads into a 'Refutatio of the Wrathful' in Chapter V.Then there's a another paragraph in Chapter V that I might label as Chapter VI, and that is Paul's 'Peroratio of Peaceful Intent'.

This isn't a criticism btwGlorified because his work is purely entertainment. There's no grand idea at work here, certainly nothing progressive like his Transcendentalist contemporaries. His work relies on the assumption that human beings are inherently evil creatures and doesn't really move beyond there. Like I said, his work is entertaining, but there's nothing profound here.
I finished reading that shit over a decade ago. It was my introduction to literature.
Having this bad taste.I'm silent.
Having this bad English.I wish you were.
Honestly, why do you read? Because you want to be entertained. True; Poe did wrote to make money, because he was broke and had drug and alcohol problems. The man is twisted of course, undeniable, but you can't say he isn't entertaining and a bad writer and poet. Frankly, I think he's the face of the Romantic Movement.
Honestly, why do you read? Because you want to be entertained.I guess we've reached a fundamental disagreement.
Pretty sure I have that same edition, but never lost the dust jacket.I also finished it a decade ago. Moved on to Lovecraft. Hurrythefuck up.And take that ugly bracelet off.
This "dust jacket"? And yeah, you got it.
think he's the face of the Romantic Movement.He's Poems In Youth are Godly ky.
I checked it out of the library last October. I thought there were a couple excellent stories and several outrageously boring ones, but I didn't read the entire book. I didn't think the satirical stories were particularly funny
Yeah, I don't blame you for not using it though. Ugly thing, not as ugly as dat bracelet doe.
A church goer can't and wont understand the analogies in either his poems or stories. Try love craft mate.
The height of modern academia is in science, and now US is going to skimp on the language arts and is to implement more pragmatic approach to writing and reading. Education will ensure scientific progression, but will also appropriate language arts away from the arts and into more scientific terms.Are approaching a Dark Age in Literature?
Probably not just literature imo. Wider and wider the widening gyre. . .
yes, and the only people turned on to lit will be the 'le super cool edgy fan club' type people, with their elitism and.. oh wiat

I felt like that when reading peoples' unabridged names in Speaker for the Dead.
I really doubt sci-fi authors use real names.
What was the name system again? Something about the orbital and subsector and parents and governing mind or something.
posting cucks
Did you seriously just use that word on /lit/ of all places? Just where do you think you are? Where the FUCK do you think you are, pleb? Get out of here, maybe come back on your 18th birthday since you'll finally be old enough to use the site.
Literally fuck off.
mfw all that long shit and there's still something with an apostrophe in itwhy is this apostrophpe shit so popular in sci fi and fantasy
JUST
you will never live in the culture and be able to sample the art of the hundreds of vast species-spanning millennia-old civilizations
why do they keep calling him a cuck, explain me this memet. meme master in training
What's wrong with it, anon? Louis CK had a joke about how white guys should let black guys fuck their wives as a true form of reparation for the slave trade. It was a silly joke and only autists would focus on it after all the "did Moot get cucked" shit i.e. Moot dated a girl. Girl supposedly cheats on Moot, le eric /pol/ gonn dun solved the mystery of the world.It's tiring and these people who obsess over this crap should really just return to /b/ or /mu/ for their ironic shitposting.
Because Dragonriders of Pern, probably. That's what made it catch on.Amusingly enough this is one of the less ridiculous Culture names.
What I don't get is why people who care about "cuck" shit are even here. Like, you don't fucking read, what the hell are you doing on a board about reading? Illiterate pricks.
did Moot get cuckedHe actually got friendzoned.he didn't get anything out of that relationship, even though he spent quite a bit of money on her, yet in the end she decided to fuck some random chadayy lmao
What's wrong with it, anon?Nothing inherently, it's just so ridiculously common.
Cuckold Internet Defense Force plz go
/b/ or /mu/everytime someone talks about the cuck meme they attribute it to a different board. wasn't it pretty much /r9k/, then /pol/, then maybe /fit/?i mean of course now it's everywhere, but they're the ones obsessed with it.
Le only I read muh postmodernist literature and am intelligent enough for euphoric discussions /r/cuckoldHe was paying for her while she fuck other menLiterally a cuckold
C U C KUCK
Honestly I don't even know what postmodernist means. I mainly just read sci-fi, fantasy, and moege.
And you have the audacity to tell others to leave
I don't know exactly, but when I think of shitposting I first think of /b/ then /mu/. /Mu/ especially since they're obsessed with shitposting - they should really know better.
How is it audacious? You cannot possibly argue that this cuck shit belongs here compared to actual books.
People always blame some other board, but the truth of it is that it all started with Reddit. 4chan steals its shit from Reddit a LOT these days, they just like to pretend they're better because they came first. Conveniently forgetting that the userbase has changed and become 90% people who started on Reddit.
it's the actual plot device from one thousand and one nights.also says that other people is illiteratedoesn't know what post modernism is
nah man that's fedora, the cuck thing is pretty dated.
implying the trash you read is actual books
implying you read booksYou have literally no right to decide that.
Yeah, like any of the people who go around shitposting about "cucks" are actually referencing ALWL. That's no excuse. Post about a motherfucking book or don't post at all.
Oh I don't have the right?I have the right to judge what ever the fuck I want and you can just sit there and suck on it my nigger.
No, you have no rights. This is the internet, not America or some shit. You're going DOWN, son.
*grabs him by the throat* Back the fuck off?!?!

I suppose scientific fact can be easily proven or disproven or at least it's validity can be compared to other ideas that relate to it.History is much different as it's open to interpretation although I've never heard of a bonkers historian gains loads of awards for a theory.

Anyone else notice that Hegel employs dialectics to subvert black and white thinking, whereas Marx uses dialectics to reinforce black and white thinking? The latter jumps to blanket statements based on dialectical dogma--everyone who isn't a prole is reactionary; that includes the lumperproletariat and the peasants, whom Marx pronounces reactionaries en masse. Marx is dangerous because he is both vital to read to foment critical thought, and one of the greatest threats to critical thought: young people can get taken in by his crackerjack analysis on some things, and then start accepting any bullshit black and white pronouncement he makes as if he's the messiah. No wonder he was the father of both a strain of highly critical thought in academics, and a fanatical, bloodthirsty religion.
how about no
How about yes.
Fucking bourgeoisie reactionary scum, die.
how about in understanding the yes you see the no and then you see that both gives maybe you are wrong
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE BOURGEOIS GET OUT

Well, the idea of historical class struggle comes from the idea of historical race struggle, partially. In one letter to Engels Marx says something like that himself when he refers to some a bit older historians that speak of races. So I guess there's a sort of black-and-whiteness in that since racist discourse is all about saying "we're this group here and we must protect ourselves against any foreign elements of other groups that might compromise us, we must do everything strategically and be suspicious of everything."

WHAT A TWIST
Poema de los donesNadie rebaje a lágrima o reproche esta declaración de la maestría de Dios, que con magnífica ironía me dio a la vez los libros y la noche. De esta ciudad de libros hizo dueños a unos ojos sin luz, que sólo pueden leer en las bibliotecas de los sueños los insensatos párrafos que ceden las albas a su afán. En vano el día les prodiga sus libros infinitos, arduos como los arduos manuscritos que perecieron en Alejandría. De hambre y de sed narra una historia griega muere un rey entre fuentes y jardines; yo fatigo sin rumbo los confines de esta alta y honda biblioteca ciega. Enciclopedias, atlas, el Oriente y el Occidente, siglos, dinastías, símbolos, cosmos y cosmogonías brindan los muros, pero inútilmente. Lento en mi sombra, la penumbra hueca exploro con el báculo indeciso, yo, que me figuraba el Paraíso bajo la especie de una biblioteca. Algo, que ciertamente no se nombra con la palabra azar, rige estas cosas; otro ya recibió en otras borrosas tardes los muchos libros y la sombra. Al errar por las lentas galerías suelo sentir con vago horror sagrado que soy el otro, el muerto, que habrá dado los mismos pasos en los mismos días. ¿Cuál de los dos escribe este poema de un yo plural y de una sola sombra? ¿Qué importa la palabra que me nombra si es indiviso y uno el anatema? Groussac o Borges, miro este querido mundo que se deforma y que se apaga en una pálida ceniza vaga que se parece al sueño y al olvido.

Why have all of her books after this been shit? I just wanna read some good historical Chinese chick lit
Does anybody else find pain and depression beautiful?
No becuase I"m not an edgy teen
I did then I got a job and my current girlfriend. Life is good.
I do but i like fun too, sadness is underrated, its calmed and peaceful.
Well i have a job but i feel like ive become even more depressed My mother has depression and as long as i can remember she would spend days at a time and lie in bed and as long as i can remember i was the sameI think she passed it on to meMaybe thats why i see it as beautiful idk
If you find depression beautiful, you've never experienced it.
i had those then things changed and im back at the op
No it's not lol
tragedy can be beautiful, but is not intrinsically beautiful.
See 
No, because I've been depressed and there's nothing beautiful about it.
Also, looking at the man in that painting is reminding me how shitty that kind of mental state is. I see myself in his expression.
Theres a certain comfort in constant quietness and lonliness but it gets hard over time.
I don't think they're beautiful by themselves, but they give rise to beautiful people.
Does anybody else find pain and depression beautiful?Yes, but only when experienced by others. Myself, I find it painful and depressing.
Well in what sense? The experience itself is shitty and you can't really say it's "beautiful". But if you think of it as some kind of mechanism the brain possesses to achieve something then yea I could totally see it as something beautiful, and pretty much any emotion for that matter.
Idk why maybe i am just being edgy but I cant think back to a time when i wasnt depressed. Ive never known happyness for more than a day or two. When i see stuff like in my pic in the OP i know how they feel and its a bond that transcends words. Ir maybe its just because i wish that i am as beautiful depressed as the pic in the op rather than a pitiful waste of a life
Yes I get sad every time I watch a sad movie and I enjoy it, however I agree with him 
no everything feels like a slightly greyer shade of grey and the only things that make me feel any different happen as a result of being unconscious or on drugs
iktfb
man in that paintingThat's our Lord Jesus Christ.
I feel you OP. I feel like theres the whole melancholy atmosphere thats very comforting. Maybe I woulden't use the words "Pain and depression" but melancholy I feel is a good way to put it.
You're probably just melancholic this
Makes sense. Many people have told me that I look like Jesus, so that would be why he reminds me of myself there.Seriously, though, everything about his posture and his face there is so spot-on it's almost unsettling.
He's half right.There are some calming forms of sadness. The wistful, longing, nostalgic type of sadness is addictive.
I really like sentimental stuff, but only if its tempered by melancholy and despair first.
he's fasting in the desert during his legendary 40 day sojourn. He is probably thinking about how the devil was tempting him or something.
It looks to me like the painter must have been pretty depressed when making this. The emotions seem very real.
I think there's something to both sides of this. I think being sad can feel good and there's something nice about it, but depression isn't sadness. Depression is a really messy, ugly, draining thing that is very different. Depression is idealized too much, but experiencing sadness, loneliness, and these kinds of feelings can be beautiful or at least important for the human experience.
This. Sadness is beautiful, but depression is the opposite of beauty.
From Poe:the true artist will always contrive, first, to tone their art into proper subservience to the predominant aim, and, secondly, to enveil them, as far as possible, in that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the essence of the poem.Regarding, then, Beauty as my province, my next question referred to the tone of its highest manifestation — and all experience has shown that this tone is one of sadness. Beauty of whatever kind, in its supreme development, invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears. Melancholy is thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones.
Seeing the beauty in all things and yet moving towards joy is the proper way"You are already perfect. And you could use some improvement" ~zen koan
No, but I do think they sometimes make you appreciate beauty more. And sometimes the beauty just depresses you more because you know you will never have it.
Pain and Depression isn't. Melancholy is.
What do u mean? Anal sex?
Once you adhere to nihilism, sadness and depression become bearable or even non-existent
Obviously no, but i miss being a retarded teen
You don't know what depression is.
Brah, depression is a horrid rotting thing.If you think it's beautiful, then you've never experienced it.
aye lmao
I think for the sake of conversion we should probably make clear what we mean by depression, for me it's a panicked sense of inadequacy and pointlessness that sucks all the life and meaning out of things and fogs up the mind. Melancholic feelings like nostalgia which includes some manner of affection and longing for a time or place, something like loneliness which is really just longing for human connection. They can be beautiful because they show how greatly it pains us to be apart from the things we love and it amazes people to feel that love within themselves.
this.normies man
The type of sadness that makes you feel human can be considered beautiful. There's nothing beautiful about depression though.
Pretty much this.When I was pretty sad, there was some comfy to it, strangely.  Nowadays I just feel empty, or anxious, so I miss when I felt melancholy/depressed 
No because that's being an egotistic self-loving fag not being depressed
I think there is beauty in sadness, yes. Not depression by itself. There is beauty in joy too of course, but going through pain, sorrow, sadness is more interesting because it's a journey. I think you learn more through difficult moments, so that is the beauty of it.I think Leonard Cohen said it best in his song Anthem:"There is a crack, a crack in everythingThat's how the light gets in"
OP didn't say you had to experience it. It could just be the idea of it. Thinking about how someone like DFW or Robin Williams were suffering so much emotional pain that they decided to hang themselves. As someone who is generally neutral and ambivalent to most things, I find it beautiful that some people are capable of such profound levels of emotional experience.
Well, maybe I am edgy but at least I'm not a faggot.
No, it's killing me slowly.
Are you in a hurry?
I got a girlfriend, it was great at first, but after awhile together life just reverts to "going through the motions" so to speak.I still experience the same melancholia as I did before.
I've had major depression since being a child and thinking it's in some way beautiful is offensively retarded.
I tire of it. Get me out of here.
What is Paradise Lost about?
a misplaced fleshlight
Wanna connect over it?
I haven't read it but I would guess the fall of man or some gay abstraction of it
With a big ol head like that, I'm sure you can figure it out for yourself champ. ;^
It's much more about the fall of Lucifer, and go read the fucking poem you mong.
Tell me that.
Honestly, is it that big?
Is that a gangrenous boil on your lip
Looks like a cherry.Probably a gangrenous boil.
It is, m'lady.Your pleasure in conversation can not be quantifiedThough dove it's pleasure in mine heart,I may not deny thee ownShould I suffice you enough this dayThe next should arise.But forsook me quickly in this anonWith brevity I will qualm your kindnessAnd create to tell youBut you are the cherry.
Cherry on your tongue hearkens summer memories; how sweet it tasted.
But so console the causeCaught with single actionLament mine memoriesWith disastrous epiphany.Anon. Here. Cause my chivalrous deadlyAnd make my name a baneA sunder my timeAnd call meBatman
it's a retelling of the fall of man from the perspective of Satan in some kind of combination greek-mythological and judeo-christian worldit rules
So mine day is dazed fillForever fingered upThe head pertainsLittle weightBecauseThe pointer is a digit that indicatesI am anon your side and sidledMy sole desire.With taste I am, and my tongue yoursThat other which hearkens strengthMore than other can ever desire.I tast and tust, tassled your statementLike a lawler to a lawyerWhore to a doveAnd more, my standard is but yoursAs a principle and much more.Consider more.
Some parts are not exactly from Satan's perspective, but he's definitely the anti-hero star of the show. But, yeah, pretty much this OP. It does in fact rule. Give the first book of the poem a read and I'm sure you'll be interested in reading more.
this, its based
It's about Satan, cast from Heaven, trying to seize power. He gives a lot of empty speeches that turn out to be ungrammatical, while Adam and Eve deal with their symbolic birth. There's a kick-ass war right in the middle; a huge nod to The Iliad right at the heart of the epic, revealing that Milton knew he owed more to Homer than he did to the Bible.
Someone loses sight of their goal and finds a palm tree instead
Just check that title. Damn. Guess it's about paradise lost.
Best scene at the beggining where satan and co try to understand why they got so fuxt. Also conversation w/ sin that satan has getting out of hell. Also the lake of fire. Def. not about office space 2.
It baits you with shit about Satan fucking things up, then turns into 6 books of Adam and Eve asking about how angels have sex.
What is Paradise Lost aboutMilton's life after he got married. After his divorce he wrote Paradise Regained.
Milton wrote it all orally when he was blind and he alludes to it in the poem. It's awesome.
what's /lit/s' opinion on steampunk genre? pic related
literally style over substance
After about '04 or '05, when steampunk started gaining public recognition as a genre and fashion subculture, the quality of its fiction when downhill fast.Older books that get lumped in with steampunk can be pretty cool, but once authors were intentionally writing things to be steampunk stories to capitalize on a hip new trend rather than writing proper sci-fi/fantasy that just happened to have a Victorian setting, the genre was fucked.Stuff like the Difference Engine is based, the Mortal Engines series skirts the edge of being tacky, and the Leviathan series is fully commercial garbage.
How to structure novel?
Here, use this.
write the novelcount the pagesnumber the pagesTh deeper point is the author's confrontation with the fundamental ambiguity of the question catalyzes and breeds the structure into being.
thanks
continual and fearless sifting and winnowing
this. there's no formula, and every author and great book entails their own design of the novel's structure. what the real question is, is "how to structure MY novel", which is still something you should only be asking and studying for yourself.
Start by asking yourself, what happens in the book? That's your main structure.Divide that into three or four acts, depending on how complex it is. Then subdivide those into chapters. Then those chapters into scenes. Write out each scene as stage direction; so and so talks to so and so, says something relevant, leaves, or drinks tea, whatever. As much detail as possible but don't worry about format or prose.There's your structure.
The fuck is this?
It's a diagram of The Hero's Journey.
Nah, man. Shit's overplayed. Use this instead.
A Tropheryma whipplei Twist is the basis of any good climactic scene.
Structure it as 5 Acts each with 5 major scenes... This will give you 25 Chapters and it will also be easily converted into a Play or even a Film.
Start with a beginning. End with a conclusion.Make your characters suffer in between.
What books can I read that will make me stop masterbation? Help me /lit/
hahahahahahathe book of chastity lelthere is nothing wrong with masturbation unless you are an excessive masturbator change your diet no coffee no tea no power drinksstop watching porncold showers good luck
No coffee? :
any good work of feminism. i read the sadeian woman recently, p good
there is nothing wrong with masturbation unless you are an excessive masturbatorAdding to that, if you're an excessive masturbator, it's most likely a side affect of bigger psychological issues such as depresssion, and if that's the case, just trying to go cold turkey from orgasms won't help you as much as actually seeing a professional about your problems.
Stop assuming things anon 99 % of your assumptions are wrong.
cold turkey form orgasmsSo if I just edge it's okay right. Edging feels pretty good. Sometimes I edge on for a week straight before I HAVE to bust it to some qt cat girl on /e/.
Infinite Cest by D.A.F. de Sade
Edging is bad. Orgasming a few times a week is good. Not doing so increases your chances of prostate cancer.
I was able to stop drinking, smoking weed/cig, drugs and masturbation using this method.All of these things cause inconvenience and discomfort in my life. I don't drink because hangovers, throwing up, not being able to play difficult video games, drive, having to throw away beer bottles, just being drink are all inconvenient and uncomfortable. Masturbation? If i jizz in the shower it cloggs the drain. If I jizz in the toilet it backs it up, now my bathroom smells like septic. If I jizz in a rag it ruins the damn rag. Kleenex/TP waste of tp. I have been clean of all of these things except the occasional night out bar hopping with friends from out of town and I haven't done that for a while because expense for a year now.So you don't need to read a book. Just look at all the jizz rags on your floor and look at your pathetic life and you wont be able to do it.
If jizz clogs your drains you need to see a doctor.
Not masturbation because you don't want to soil a rag is like starving because you don't like doing the dishes. It's silly and detrimental to your mental and physical health.
Or masturbate more
This3x a week, isn't it?
I believe anything from once a week to daily is alright, but three or every other day seems like a good standard.
It's medically recommended to evacuate your seminal vesicle and prostate gland at least once a month. Anything more than that is just overkill.It happens naturally for most people via nocturnal emission though, so there's actually very little reason to masturbate for physical wellness.
With 'overkill' are you implying that it's too much and detrimental?
No, just unnecessary to maintain optimal prostate health. Excessive 4+ daily masturbation can rarely result in penile fracture or irregular blood flow, but you're otherwise fine.
Doesn't orgasming/ejaculation require a lot of energy/resources though?
penile fracture
How much is excessive?
Embrace it anonJerk that dick like you were born to do
Masturbation is the only thing that allows me to continue my work without going fucking nuts over spending my time reading and researching rather than chasing release. I just treat it like a meal now. Usually just something to fulfill hunger, with a few mainstay styles, and every now and then I'll eat have a bit more or something more special.
The monkey is the only animal, except man, that practices this science; hence he is our brother; there is a bond of sympathy and relationship between us. Give this ingenious animal an audience of the proper kind, and he will straightway put aside his other affairs and take a whet; and you will see by the contortions and his ecstatic expression that he takes an intelligent and human interest in his performance. - Mark Twain
Not him, but it depends more on the place masturbation has in your life than the frequency with which you do it that makes it problematic.

Post your probably shitty ASOIAF theories, /lit/Has anyone ever thought of how the Stark family strongly resembles the Seven? Eddard and Catelyn being obvious, with Sansa being the Maiden, Arya the Stranger, Robb the Warrior, Bran the Crone, Rickon the Builder referencing his future, and Jon Snow representing the wholeness of God Being that prophecized fuck no one will shut up aboutAlso pitching an idea for Cleganebowl: Hound is resurrected by Thoros/Stoneheart, and Cleganebowl also symbolizes the battle between life and death. It's no secret that Thoros hates the Mountain and that Cat hates Cersei. The symbolism serves to demonstrate that these religions and their magicks stem from one source, making each apparently valid in some form. To support this claim, Martin said we wouldn't be seeing gods appear, making the true nature of these gods ambiguous if not entirely indeterminable. Were I to wager a guess, I'd say that Martin's point on religion is that one could try so hard and get so far, but in the end, it doesn't really matter.

HBO has the book rights now. They recast all the characters to a racially friendly version. Tyrone Lannister, a black little-person, rides a dragon along side Denisha Targaryen, a strong independant black womyn, and Jemal Snow becomes Lord of Winterfel.

won cos he never battled against real warlords such as twyin and stannis. also, he had that diredog that was a killing machineit would be more appropriate to call him robb the idiot, dude lost 1/3 of his army because muhh found love. and letting theon leave because muh power of friendship? he fucking deserved his end
Is there a book that accurately describes that sentiment of when your girlfriend or wife is clearly flirting with someone else and acting naive about it "honeeey, why are you acting so paranoid? He just wants to talk" and you feel a combination of impotence and anger until a few days later you realise you just have to accept this condition and then you become slightly more cynical, hopeless and misogynistic?

what you're talking about is cuckoldingNo it isn't, stop thinking in memes.
yes, it is. in the real world cuckolding is not actually a meme
Cuckolding in the sense you're talking about is getting sexual pleasure from watching your wife or gf with another man.Literally the opposite of what OP is talking about.

no, that's a cuckoldry fetosh ,you fucking mongoloid. Cuckolding is the act of cheating, it has literally nothing to do with sexual pleasure on the part of the one getting cucked. I fucking hate you. How can you be this god damned stupid?
Most girls cheat. Accept this, internalize this, and redistribute your emotional bonds accordingly.
Even then flirting isn't cheating.It's still not fucking cuckolding if she hasn't fucked anybody and he isn't even married to her.

How is this man so underappreciated and underdiscussed?Though not an economist by training, he correctly predicted the progression of the global economy toward a system of floating exchange rates, with governments using fiscal deficits as monetary stimuli, and so on.His most valuable contribution was in being among the foremost theoreticians on the banking system as we know it AKA the system of fractional reserves.While Keynes, Marx and Hayek are discussed endlessly in academic circles and in for-TV specials, someone who actually understood the functioning of the financial system and the needs of international trade has somehow escaped the widespread recognition that such an overwhelmingly correct assessment calls for. So what gives? Have you read him? Are you interested in economics?
who is he

Come on guys I know if you really have so much to say about Russell Brand you must have something to say here.For instance: why is it that there is no political ideology centered around this conception of economics? Is it too nuanced? Canada has had some success with Social Credit based political parties but it's never something that has had enough momentum to go further.Is Nationalism the only political ideology that could employ the knowledge of Soddy's works?
I recently started reading a few Lovecraft stories and have been reading for enjoyment for the first time in years. I absolutely loved the shadow over innsmouth and the thing in the doorstep. Can anyone recommend any similar authors or books they think I would enjoy?
The Great God Pan by Arthur MachenPerdido Street Station by China MiévilleRobert E. Howard's horror storiesThomas LigottiYou might also want to read's Lovecraft's essay Supernatural Horror in Literature to see what he liked and try if you would too.
Dig into the things that influenced Lovecraft, primarily the works of Edgar Allan Poe, but there are plenty of othershttp://www.hplovecraft.com/life/interest/authors.aspx
Thank you both
Any other suggestions?
Thomas Ligotti gets compared to Lovecraft all the time. I personally don't see the similarity, but I haven't actually read Lovecraft; all I know of his writings are what I've heard from others, as horror doesn't interest me too much.
I've read The Call of Cthulhu and At The Mountains Of Madness and i hated them. Most of the time he is just describing objects or landscapes.
I enjoyed the pacing of the shadow over innsmouth how it builds up to the frantic hotel escape and run out of the town to his realizations after

Where do I start with Dostoyevsky? I own copies of most of his books but have yet to read them. Please leave some reasoning.
I would just read whichever seems the most interesting to you and go from there. I don't see much reason to read Dostoyevsky's works In any specific order
Start with the GreeksAnd then read Notes from the UndergroundAnd then Crime and PunishmentAnd then Brothers KaramazovAnd then the Idiot and Demons
notes from the underground
I just finished brothers karamazov and it was my first exposure to Dostoevsky. Shit was straight cash.
like this:Dead Soulsa Hero of Our Time Fathers and Sons Notes from undergroundCrime and Punishmentthe GamblerBrothers Karamazovthen read all his other short storiesthen the rest of his big ones.faggot.
Whatever you do don't start with Notes from Underground, or if you do, understand that it's very different from his other works.I'd say, start with Crime and Punishment.
Hey thanks, I think I wanna start with Brothers Karamasow, although I feel like Crime and Punishment might be the better introduction.
not reading tbk last
notes from underground is like a hundred pages long and it will blow your friggin' mind, everything else he wrote after that is christfag shit.
pick up Tolstoy, Lermontov and Pushkin instead
Crime and Punishment is his most famous and accessible so start thereThen Karamazov because that's his masterpieceThen Notes From Underground cos you'll need to break up his tomes with a novellaThen The Devils / Demons / The Possessed because it's probably his most difficult and darkest and flawed though it was my favourite Then The Idiot because that's the last one you need to read to complete Dosto If you really must read something else try The Eternal Husband and Other Stories or The GamblerHaven't enjoyed anything else I've read by him Poor Folk, A Raw Youth, Insulted and Injured, House of the Dead etc - don't bother with these unless you're literally addicted
This guy has a pretty good way through it, although personally I'd split up C&P and TBK with Notes, but it's not a big deal. As long as your first three are those in some sort of combination you'll be fine.
I personally started with Notes From Underground and followed it up with The Double, but I think The Double would be much easier to start with as it's short and actually quite easy to read whereas Notes From Underground's first half is going to take you for granted if you don't know what to expect.
I read Karamazov before anything else and did not find it difficult in the slightest, not because of my ability to read, but because he's not a difficult author to comprehend. Once you can wrap your mind around the two names of each individual, then there is no problem. TBK is the best, and if any ought to be first, might as well be this life altering masterpiece because you don't have to worry about the quality of the rest being diminished after reading the magnum opus; the genius is evident in all of his novels.
Brother's Karamazov is the only book of his I've read and it's one of my favorite books, so I'd assume it's as good a place as any to start
so you didn't want to read more from the author of one on your favorite books?
I just never got around it. Who reads a bunch of books by the same author in a row? That sounds boring as shit
every time I read a book I really love I end up reading something else by that author, later if not immediately after. like, there's gold here, why not dig for more? but that's just meNotes from Underground if you're fucked up in the head, Crime and Punishment if you're normal. probably Notes since youre on 4chan
This. Notes From Underground fantastically embodies bitterness, misanthropy, elitism yet self-consciousness, anxiety and depression.
notes from underground lays a foundation both in themes and style for the rest of his works, my progression I would recomend this is not the order I read these in is:Notes from UndergroundCrime and Punishment House of the deadThe AdolescentThe Brothers Karamazovthen go back and fill in the blanks
i've read white nights and i loved it. now i'm reading the the brothers karamazov. i'm liking it so far but all he talks about are starecs and religion
Do first: da Gambler and Notes.Then choose a novel, idiot.
The Gambler is his shortest. Why not start with this?
because you don't wanna be a lazy fuck
Notes from Underground is his best work, because the length isn't bloated and it's written in first-person. And there isn't any Christ-faggotry.
Going straight from the Greeks to DostoyevskyUnless you're memeing, surely the Bible/Pushkin/Cervantes/Gogol should go in as a primer.
I started with brothers Karamazov
Anyone above the age of 16 of moderate intelligence should be able to read dostoevsky
Is beginning with The Idiot a bad idea? That's the only one I got.
Cool, since a random anonymous person started BK I think I'm now inspired to start it too, thanks so much bro!
You made a thread asking where to start so I told you, you stupid cunt
no problem, I hope you enjoy it
It's not a bad idea. I don't quite get the whole "where do I start?" thing that /lit/ is obsessed with.
It's autism. They will never know the feeling of picking up a book at the store just because it looks nice or reading a book because you want to and not just to impress the people on the chinese cartoon board
You fell for it.
Yeah. OP probably only reads muh classics
I don't take it too seriously, but sometimes it's helpful with more difficult writers to have a certain direction when trying to get into them. It took me a while to get into Heidegger, and a bit of direction might've helped with that.
I own copies of most of his books but have yet to read them.Check to see if they were translated by Constance Garnett first. If any were, you need to burn them.
tfw own the vintage C&P, TBK and Demons
White nights is what i started with. Good intro to his style. And then i went on to the Gambler, and Crime and Punishment that i'm reading now, so i'd recommend that
Where do I start with Dostoyevsky?The bible.
mfw I realised that I'm the only concious human being with the ability of thought and that everyone else is just pretending to be sentient

Where can I read about the alienation and separation induced by technology upon society.
It's been induced on us by ourselves for way longer before cellphones came around.
Heidegger, Milbank, Marx. The Unambomber if you want something not so heavy
Are there any identifiable philosophical influences in the Unabomber's writings?
Probably not, his way of writing is pretty basic and understandable and doesn't use much terminology.
Ellul
Read A Midsummer Night's Dream, and consider how the world of Ethos Lovers, the world of Logos Craftsmen and the world of Pathos Fairies can be retold, by replacing magic with technology.What's important are those basic barriers, not the realism with which it is portrayed. You can do the rest as a writer.
Nietzsche, sort of. At least it seems like he iterated some of the ideas Nietzsche did, but in a far different context and without actually backing them up.
This. Also Arendt.
Is it possible to feel emotions if you're depressed?
are despair, self-loathing, and feelings of hopelessness not emotions?
fucking phonefag
Yes. So what do you call being emotionally barren then? And what makes depression different from simply feeling down?
The term depression was derived from the Latin verb deprimere, "to press down".[12] From the 14th century, "to depress" meant to subjugate or to bring down in spirits. It was used in 1665 in English author Richard Baker's Chronicle to refer to someone having "a great depression of spirit", and by English author Samuel Johnson in a similar sense in 1753.[13] The term also came into use in physiology and economics.An early usage referring to a psychiatric symptom was by French psychiatrist Louis Delasiauve in 1856, and by the 1860s it was appearing in medical dictionaries to refer to a physiological and metaphorical lowering of emotional function.[14]
a physiological and metaphorical lowering of emotional function
Dubs have it
Are you depressed?Lack of feeling can be the coldwater inverse of burning emotion, necessary at times for the return to life
YesSadnessAnd lonelinessAnd a couple others like fear
Thank you Wiki.So is Clinical Depression a spook then?
Are you depressed?I don't know what I'm feeling. It's a combo of resignation, indignation, despair, fatalistic submission, and anger. All come about by relative serious uncertainty in the future. I Feel like a turd.
Get a plan for your future, it will help overcome your feelings. Seek help if you're stuck or it gets worse.
So is Clinical Depression a spook then?Yes and no.It is a historically limited thing. It is based on the idea that there is a soul or psyche in you that is specific only to you, and you must confess to your doctor the truth about your inner self if you want to get cured, part of the cure being the confession itself e.g. talk therapy.But this doesn't mean that it is merely an illusion, our lives today are organized around this notion of personality to the point that it has become reality. So it's not merely a case of simply ceasing to believe in it one day.There are other options though. Like, you could approach it from a point of view of Epicureans or Stoics. However, the problem is that there are no Stoic masters today to pull you up from your current state like there are psychotherapists. So the best you can do is probably to read some of the letters they were sending each other, seeking each other's advice. Maybe you can find something in there that you can relate to.

Where do I start with poetry? Any good introductory books?
Mother Goose.
Poems for the Millennium vol 1-3 are probably the best anthologies for poetry from the mid nineteenth century on.
Ignore the Tupac, but this is a pretty rough guide.Best place to start is with Shakespeare sonnets and Edgar Allan Poe's poetry, most elementary stuff.
Dylan was a better poet than Ginsberg and both knew it.

Are there any stories where the antagonist wins?

Yes

Epic, my good sir. You are a gentleman and a scholar.
War & Peace Napoleon did nothing wrong
The old man and the seaThe sea wins
I hold the unusual view that Humbert Humbert is the antagonist of Lolita. Lolita itself has no protagonist, the reader is the one being antagonized. Humbert gets you to listen to his entire testimony and become sympathetic. Humbert actually beats the whole world, because the novel is so well regarded: usually, people would say, "a confession from a pedophile?" and it would become a curiosity for journalists, psychologists and perverts.
The Brothers Karamazov and its copycat, To Kill A Mockingbird.This, too.
Protagonist does not mean good guy; it means central character. A character can be an unlikable ass and still be the protagonist
the brothers karamazov and its copycat to kill a mockingbird Explain how these two are at all similar.
No he doesn't. He just gets fucked.
They're both books about court cases that got famous in a short amount of time and innocent people get convicted. The trials also begin at the very ends of the books, as well. Both books focus on the mindset of children as a theme. The difference is that To Kill A Mockingbird is a lot more predictable.
Would a clockwork orange count?
most famous plays are tragedies where the antogonist wins like Faust for example.
And it has entirely different themes and characters. These similarities are all arbitrary plot elements. The Brothers Karamazov is about the existence of God and TKaM is a coming of age story about equality. In plenty of respects the Brothers a Karamazov is way more predictable than to Kill a Mockingbird.
1984Party wins in the end.
Animal farm too then?
Blood Meridian
I'll say it again. Alex is the protagonist. Just because he's an asshole doesn't make him the antagonist.
I'm not sure if Napoleon is really an antagonist.
the Brothers a Karamazov is way more predictable than to Kill a MockingbirdYou forgot to mention that that isn't true.
The state would be the antagonist? Besides one guy getting impeached the state hardly looses out
The ahole pigs become equal to humans and repeat the oppressive cycle of the animal farm
Or society is the antagonist, since society is what loses in the end.
Death Note fm fans sure are observant intellectuals.
It was so fucking obvious that Smerdyakov did it. I loved the book, but the plot was very predictable in that sense.
Society dosent lose too much in the end, alex reforms himself of his own will to become a productive member of said society
It wasn't that obvious. It wasn't supposed to be that much of a mystery, anyway.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Milan
I'm not sure if there is an antagonist, but since the states use of classical conditioning on Alex was deemed illegal, and Alex has a happy ending they do pretty much lose. I see where you're coming from though
Are you kidding? Smerdyakov was suspicious as fuck. I know it wasn't much of a mystery but my point is that it is not really more or less predictable than to kill a mockingbird.
I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream
It's not even a mystery. The murder doesn't even happen until 700 or so pages in. You can't predict that "Smerdyakov did it" when "it" doesn't happen in the first two thirds of the book.
Do you think alex then comes out ahead in the end? Not arguing you, just want your opinion
Blood Meridian
Yeah. He reforms of his own will, the treatment no longer affects him, and he just seems pretty happy about it if I remember correctly.
Macbeth
does fotrtinbras jr count as an antagonist if he barely even shows up in the storythis is a great one

What does /lit/ think about The Feminine Mystique? I wanted to read something that gives an overall idea of what the feminist movement consists of.
That book has little to do with modern feminism. Read the Dialectic of Sex.
It's rather dated and only focuses on the dissatisfaction driving second-wave feminism. The Second Sex is a better choice if you want a single volume overview of feminism. If you're interested in an overview of the goals and philosophy of radical feminism, The Dialectic of Sex is your best choice.
Thanks for the feedback, I'll check them out!

I already know what I'm going to read next, but here's my backlog. I'd appreciate any opinions on anything on here:Thee Psychick Bible1Q84Confessions of a MaskAnything by Thomas LigottiUlyssesBook of the New SunThat's all I can think of at the moment. I think there are others, but I can't remember what they are.

Oh, and a couple of people told me I should read The Count of Monte Christo, but I'm not entirely sure whether I want to. It seems like it would be a pretty tedious read.
personally, when I start a new author I start on their smaller books, to get a feel for their natural rhythms and style, and then dive into the heavier stuff. I would recommend reading Notes From Underground before any other Dostoevsky, and maybe The Idiot before you read The Brothers Karamazov but if you already far in, don't stop.Honestly, with you being new to literature and all it is hard to give recs, but if I were you I'd choose a big book and slowly chip away at it meanwhile blasting through small ones/novellas. Kafka is very good, Candide is easy and funny. I'd start with those.
Yeah I'm about 450 pages through the Karamazovs - this is the fifth time I've tried reading I kept giving up at around the 100 page mark and I'm determined to finish it now. If I do get tired of it I might take a break and read Candide and Metamorphosis like you said.
I'm about 450 pages through the KaramazovsOh fuck, shit's about to get real. Don't stop now, it gets pretty interesting from that point. I finished it today, and let me tell you that those last ten pages are easily worth the 900 that build up to it. That was a sublime ending.
1Q84No. Highly redundant. Ambitious but disappointing. Did I mention redundant.
Candidespeaking of redundant
Is it really that bad? I feel pretty let down already.
UlyssesGood luck with this. I tried whittling through it with Frank Delaney's podcast. They help a lot, but most of the references are over my head. I stopped reading it and I am doing some Bible reading and some light Greek research here and there.tfw only made it to page 20
There are good elements, specifically the concept of 1Q84, but they were never fleshed out as far as they could have been for the size of the novel.You'll start to find patterns soon enough, repetition repetition repetition.
Is it a very challenging book? I enjoyed Dubliners, and I didn't know Ulysses was that much more difficult. How bad is it compared to Finnegans Wake?
I'll have to see for myself. I just found out about the book a couple of days ago, so I'm not too familiar with what the concept is.Also, another book on my backlog is Welcome to the NHK. I fucking loved the TV show adaptation, so I'm interested to know whether the original novel is worth reading.
Only read the first couple pages of each, and Ulysses is infinitely easier than Finnegans. Ulysses at least uses actual words - Finnegans is literal gibberish.
I read Dubliners specifically so I could get a foundation of familiarity with Joyce so I could eventually read Finnegans. I like the idea of a book that isn't meant to be understood, but it just chaos with a cryptic plot hidden within the text.
off to sleep bump
your collection looks freakishly like what I'd like mine to look like in a while.  I've only just started getting into lit as well
One of the few books I have actually read - Meditations is amazing. Read that as soon as you can, can be read in a day, or even just random passages are helpful.
what I'm looking at for my next novel:Saul Bellow - HerzogIshmael Reed - Mumbo JumboHenry Miller - Tropic of CancerI'll probably go with Mumbo Jumbo so why even post lolThe Joyces go without saying of course. Be sure to pick up more Faulkner for maximum corncobbiness
I enjoyed Dubliners, and I didn't know Ulysses was that much more difficult.kekWhy are you skipping Portrait? It's much harder than Dubliners, and then Ulysses comes along and blows Portrait out of the water. Joyce was always pushing himself and the difference between Dubliners and Ulysses is vast.
meditations on life You're doing a disservice to Musil with your retarded wording
how is my wording retarded? Why do you feel the need to defend Musil?
Why do you feel the need to defend Musil?idk maybe because I did my masters thesis on him. maybe because he is one of the best writers
again i ask, how is my wording retarded?
'cause you literally said something vague and unspecific that can be applied to any writeryou obviously don't know shit about Musil besides the fact that he wrote TMWQ
i have encountered you a few times. Why are you so negative when others show their enjoyment in an author? Tell me, since you seem to know everything, what do I know about Musil? And did Musil intend for a possible reader to read more than The Man Without Qualities? Also, when I am looking for recommendations, why would I write an essay on the reasons for my enjoyment of Musil? I would therefore have to write one for Nescio, whoever wrote Ecclesiastes and McCarthy just because an autist may attack me for his own lack of confidence. That would be a bit absurd would it not?
what do I know about Musil?Nothing, obviously.  And did Musil intend for a possible reader to read more than The Man Without Qualities? Yes, certainly. why would I write an essayNo one said you had to. It is not a necessary condition. However, if you enjoy a writer, specifically Musil in this case, then you need to stop being retarded and actually explain why you like him, which will allow people to recommend you works respectively. But I can tell you're retarded and are incapable of explaining anything. That would be a bit absurd would it not?No.
 And did Musil intend for a possible reader to read more than The Man Without Qualities? Yes, certainly.citation neededI truly am curious what sort of trauma or inherent fault you have to be so negative when someone states their enjoyment with an author you clearly find some enjoyment in also.I wrote those four authors names in such a way that anyone with critical faculties, which you lack apparently, can think "What do they have in common?" and come up with an answer and respond with a good recommendation. Now if you are too ignorant to do that, fine, but don't shit up this thread with your autistic shit-flinging, please.
You're trying too hard to seem unperturbed. You're a faggot that can't even explain -- in a few sentences -- why they like certain writers. It's embarrassing. citation neededRead his diaries, you mongoloid. with critical faculties, which you lack apparentlyLiterally projecting at this point.

I read that Ulysses uses some of the same characters that were in Dubliners. It seemed like a logical next step, since Portrait isn't related to either of the stories.
Main character from Portrait is also one of the main protagonists from Ulysses.
Oh, that changes everything, then. I already have a copy of Portrait it was bundled in with my copy of Dubliners, along with his poems and other things, so I guess I'll read that next.

Read what you want, guys.
Infinite Jest is a meme is a meme, it's actually worth the read  ironically for the entertainment. If you're looking to start with Kierkegaard, it's best to start with his work chronologically. Same with Hegel, although if you don't have background knowledge of some previous philosophers you won't get the most out of Kierkegaard and Hegel will be unintelligible. Don't be dissuaded, no one gets through Phenomenology of Spirit their first time and fully understands it.

Your backlog is similar to mine.I finished crime and punishment last night.started one flew over the cuckoo's nest today for something different than c&p. About half way through and it's pretty good. It's funny and a fair bit lighter than c&p.You should definitely read the illiad but not right after Dostoevsky in my opinion.
It's not more tedious than Ulysses
It's about six times the length of Ulysses, though.
Any reason why not to read the Iliad afterwards? I had wanted to start Ulysses but apparently I need to read the Iliad and Odyssey first..again not sure if a meme or actually relevant to the book.
Ty based anon, no one ever gives me serious Hegel or Kierkegaard info.
Where would I start before Hegel then?
I guess it's a personal preference, but I like to break up reading long "deep" books with a shorter lighter one or some poetry. It gives me time to digest the first book before jumping into another.

True mate, kind of why I was opposed to hopping into The Brothers Karamazov.
Currently reading The Plague and slogging through Don Quixote, just finished Part 1 and I hope Part 2 is better, but after that I was thinking of starting some subset of:Arabian NightsPale FireThe Periodic TableLittle BigOscar WaoThe Heart is a Lonely HunterOrsinian TalesThe Confessions of Felix KullThe Coming of Conan
The Periodic TableThat one's a pretty easy read. It's only a page long, you just have to familiarize yourself with the way it's structured.
Thoughts on 'Salem's Lot?
PortraitJane EyreThe sun also risesSomething by FaulknerSome Berkeley, Hume, and NietszcheJourney to the End of night
If your plan is to work your way through Joyce, I reccomend reading portrait as well. Just read all four major works in their chronological order to build up to finny because each book pushes so much further than the last. And of course soread them by readibg other stuff in between
6 times the length? Ulysses - 680 pagesMonte Cristo - 1200 pagesI have no idea what misinformation you are working under
Sun also rises is straightforward as fuck, just blast through it to get to Faulkner.
heart is a lonely hunter is a good summer time book if you're in the northern hemispherelolita and 2666 are the best of these imo, maybe space blood meridian and 2666 out bc both have similar scenes of repeated violence for long sections that can be draining at least from what i'm heard of bmheart of a dog, frankenstein, and the stranger you can all read in a weekend put in order of most to least fun and then get to the bros karmfor second dudes-the above, death of ii, the trial, and of course the illiad should probably be read asafpread as i lay dying before sound and the furyi would consider naked lunch or one flew over the cuckoos nest and f wake as the books of least importance on your listsee faulkner advice and read absalom 3rd, but i read absalom absalom first so whateverof your stack, i'd read dubliners or to the lighthouse first though
tfw no mildly autistic girlfriend who's interested in literaturehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JuwEuMh-Nw

she's missing some hair?pronounced Hermann Hesse's name wrong?would fuck.also, Hermann Hesse's short stories are amazing
op is the girl in the video, i'm calling you out.better post some classy boudoir shots now.
Why do people do this?And why specifically girls?
tfw she got doxxed and killed herself/lit/ went too far that day :/
Katie 2.0 happening

She had me at "Hello".Doki doki!
/lit/, everyone says start with the Greeks, but so many of the Greeks that are listed important to read only have fragments left of their work.If you don not read the big ones, Homer, Hesiod, Sophocles, Plato, and Aristotle, how long would it take to realistically read the rest? The rest being: Archilochos, Sappho, Alkman, Pindar, Aeschylus, Euripides, Aristophanes, Herodotus, Thucydides, Heraclitus, Empedocles, Menander, Longinus, Callimachus, Theocritus, Pltarch, Aesop, and Lucian.I am asking because I am trying to figure out what to actually read from the Greeks and how much time I will be putting into it.
Nah bitch, start with niggaopolis. Greatest book evr.
PindarEuripedesAristophanesHerodotusPlutarchAesopLucannot big ones wtf.I suppose the "main" 3 would be Homer Plato and Aristotle. God knows why you have Hesoid as one of the big ones but not any of these others. Hell, Pindar is a more signficant poet.
That was not clever
and you didn't even count Aeschylus
Shaka Zulu wrote And you should read it.
In Spanish.
Why Hesiod? Theogony.I am not trying to make some justified distinction. I am sure where to start and off the top of my head that distinction seemed to make sense.Have you read everyone I've mentioned? Would it take a long while to read all of them? I really do not know who has only fragments left and who has complete works.
No I haven't read everyone you've mentioned but I've read at least something from almost all of them in translation rip me. It depends what you're interested in. Someone like Thucydides is very interesting if you're interested in war and the Athenian day-to-day culture. If we're talking in purely "literary" terms you should read the sophacles, aeschylus, eurpiedes, sophacles, aristophanes, pindar and homer; and then see if you want to go further meander/hesoid/other members of the 9 lyrical poets etc.The most significant three in cultural terms are probably Homer, Plato and Artistotle like I said. Although you should really know the story of thebes at least and Sophacles Oedipus Trilogy is probably the best.
Also is Loeb Classical Library the way to go with this sort of thing?
I have read Sophacles Oedipus Trilogy and I know the story of thebes roughly from Cadmus to Dionysus. It is one fucked city.Also, pretty weird how so many families connect in such weird ways.Ok I will take your advice because I am more interested in the literature rather than day to day life or a guide to farming. Are there any others I have not listed that should be read to get the fullest understanding of Greek literature?
Of course there is if you want the fullest understanding then read everything including the fragments from everyone. Just go on wikipedia and read all the surviving fragments that you can find in translation. You also missed out on pretty big names like Apollonius of Rhodes.
Would you recommend Loeb Classical Library Harvard Press for translations?
Not the OP but why are you being such a dick? This guy is asking for advice. Pause for a second, ignore the internet impulse, then respond like a decent human being without your harsh asshole tone. There's nothing impressive about the fact that you've spent time reading something that another person hasn't yet.
If I did not have any understanding of poetry, meter, or rhyme, would it be worth it read a book on it or just wiki it?
haven't readlol? Where did I say it was impressive. I'm certainly severely lacking in knowledge. There's a difference between asking for advice and asking stupid questions "fullest understanding of Greek literature", are you really surprsied I told him to read everything? Jesus.
Heaven forbid you put in some effort when speaking to another. Should I just refuse to speak to you since you are literally speaking nonsense?There's a difference between asking for advice and asking stupid questions "fullest understanding of Greek literature"You can intuit just like everyone else, and it is not that difficult to do so. Get over yourself.
First it was why are you being such a dicknow it'slitterally speaking nonsense?Don't you think it's hilarious that you respond in the same hostile tone that you alledge I do.What is there to intuit? I already gave him an outline and then he asks if he has to read everything and I said yes. There's no need to have an autistic fit about it.
there are people on /lit/ who claim to have started with the greeks and haven't read the complete plays of Aeschylus, Euripides and Aristophanesfuck off seriously go to /pol/ if you're just gonna half-heartedly read the republic and nicomachean ethics
read Stephen fry's "the ode less travelled"
Fuck off
hit too close to home, eh champ?
What is there to intuitHe asked for major names, you said he was missing some major names, he then asked what he should read to get the fullest whatever.Maybe you mentioning that he was missing large names should be a clue that he is asking for other large names, you autist.
You are just an idiot. Fuck off

I mentioned a name that I thought would be relevent to him. We already discerned that he had most of them covered and I added a persson who I thought would be construed by most as a "major name". I don't know why this is so hard for you to understand. As silly as it is I can't help but wonder if you're autistic or just really stupid.
I think you should both stop calling each other autistic. That's racist.

Slavoj Zizek was transmigrated into a barbell, i must sniff my nose yet i have no noseto snif, slavoj thought to himself.After being hoisted up in various ways for what seemed like an eternity in his metal consciousness prison, he had an epyphany.I am hoisted up for the porpuse of another *sniff* yet this becomes my porpuse, oh my god this is pure ideology.This thought resonated within his metal bindings thus returning him to the body of a fat slovenian marxist.

It is in the schniff fable of Anon that we see perhaps the most damnibg of postmodern apathy schniff. Of course that is the apathetic feelings one has when faced with the schniff overwhelming uh uh forces of multinationals, the sort of contradictions inherent in a liberal-democratic society and so on. In this tale of Anon in the last two or three hours the classic Western liberal response goes something like "he schniff is a victim of corporate takeover the u-uh fundamental Rightists funded by fat cats are taking advantage of his desire for a waifu and disdain for real life women and schniff a-and so on" But is it not the Anon himself who schniff knows how ridiculous his NEET lifestyle is and is, in fact, its mist viscious critic? The greateat thing about the so called Smug Pepe meme is that it is a criticique made by the very ones being critiqued! It is in Anons rabid self criticism and loathing that we truly understand this sector of schniff modern Western capitalist societies; not the taping of these eternal children by some spooky fat cat boogeymen but their own conscious we vision to remain man children schniff to capitalize on its advantages. In this way schniff the true capitalist IS the victim of capitalism himself!

He is a mememan. Part man, all meme.
that bartleby shirt
all memes aside, hes right about alot of shit.also zizek posting is fun, fuck you.
I don't know or care to know him that wellMarquis arrived before me at the bart station and was waiting outside when I got out. He talks about how he had just spent the past few days with the girlfriend of a guy who I recently beat the fuck out of. From the way he strongly hints, but won't outright say, I get the feeling he didn't fuck the girl the day before she left with him she ditched her boyfriend to smoke meth with me and a few people, and acted natural as I felt up on her. I could fuck herI grab a couple of beers and we meetup with Lani and her friend Christina. This is my first time meeting Christina and I come upon the instant realization that she looks much better in pictures I have her open my beer with her teeth, and I'm not really sure what to make of the girlMarquis keeps bringing up how bad the guy who I beat up looks, but I don't have my contacts in, can't see a thing and feel generally unkempt and self conscious despite the girl being ugly I still want to impress herHer and Lani soon leave, after hessitating I chase after them and question Lani. Is she planning on hanging out with guys? Was she earlier that day? What the fuck is her problem? She's still pissed I yelled at her the night before and, moreover, she feels unconsciously justified in being so because of how desperate I'm actingWe part ways, me and Marquis finish a cigarette in front of bart while I stand there, blind as a fucking bat, attempting to keep the conversation goingAs soon as I hop off bart alone, I hear my phone ring. Lani wants to hangoutI feel rejuvenated, I almost brag about this to Marquis as an excuse for how boring I was acting, but the thought of him thinking I'm lying about it stops meI see a guy who I was in a holding tank with I was arrested for domestic violence, he was arrested for being a part of a protest across the street from a burgerking, where I get a medium meal for $12After that, in my attempt to save money on a lighter while I'm too self conscious to ask for one without buying anything, I get a WSJ sunday paper for $3 and forget to ask for matches. I'm hemorrhaging money at this point when Lani calls me to say she's broke and if I have money for beer, it almost feels like she wouldn't hangout with me if I didn't get beer. I had just spent an unusual amount of money during my short walk home, and I can see with a distant clarity how fate seems to want to fuck things for me and this girl-We argue, she turns around, I get desperate, she pushes away-Although I'm fast losing interest for the girl, I get her to answer and say I want to be with her. This soothes her, and puts me in a non-losing position in this competition of a relationship But yeah I'm still alone tonight and I can barely see the tv, and won't be able to until I get my pack of contacts dropped off tomorrow

Greeks vs. Romans.Which are the more respectable people?The Romans were practical people. They referenced the "gods" without creating any stories about them. The Greeks were mental masturbaters that needed an explanation for everything. They forwarded the idea that the world can be understood by humans by way of categorizations, definitions, and narratives. Socrates would tell a dog that it couldn't know loyalty because it couldn't verbalize it. Winner: Romans
along the sophists, Socrates was a troll which the Greeks could not stand.ROMANSOMANS

Both. I can trace my heritage back to when my Methodist great great great great great grandparents stepped into New England because they were being persecuted by the papacy in their native Germany and England.

Zeus and Jupiter were actually quite similar. The Romans copied a lot of Greek culture. Their gods even lived on Mount Olympus.
The Greeks were better.The Romans were the early forerunner to modern English speaking philosophers who claim that any idea that doesn't have immediate Engineering applications or help you enslave the planet better is non-falsifiable mumbo jumbo that needs to be banned.

It's hard to make such a simplified comparison because 1 they were not two clear and distinct worlds, instead there were gradual and parallel transformations, but also insertions of one into the other; and 2 both worlds were themselves very heterogeneous and changing through time and place.

www.ideologylit.comLESS THAN A WEEK BEFORE SUBMISSIONS CLOSE EDITIONWhat is this?A brand new literary journal. We are still narrowing down our voice and style, but that's where you can help. We are currently accepting unpublished prose and poetry for Issue #000 Genesis until May 31st.Issue #000?This is a kind of a trial issue. Originally, #000 was going to have published works from established authors, just to demonstrate what an issue would look like. We decided to let #000 be open for submissions so we could include some original writing.Starting with #001, we will have much more regular submission and publishing schedules as well as containing only unpublished works.How can I submit?There are two ways to submit. You can e-mail us at submissions@ideologylit.com or you can use the anonymous submissions form on our website.We will respond to all submissions.What's accepted?All unpublished poetry and prose. Every issue also has a sort of "competition," centered around the theme. The best submissions that feature this theme will headline each issue. The theme for Issue #000 is "GENESIS." You can read more about the guidelines on our website.Is this the first literary journal from /lit/?No. There's been others in the past, perhaps most notably TAR: The April Reader.I'm not interested / stop spamming / this isn't /lit/-relatedWe're sorry to hear that. All threads on /lit/ will be called "IDEOLOGY: A literary journal" and will be started under this tripcode, so please add that to your spam filter and you won't see us anymore.
tfw 500 word essay due in the next week;_;why do the writing gods conspire against me
Did you check your spam folder like that one guy in the other thread told you to?
how long do you usually take to respond?
Yes, we will be checking our spam folders. I don't believe anything has been classified as spam yet.We'll be responding in the first half of June. We won't be responding until submissions are closed.
What happened to TAR? Was anyone in on that?
So how many submissions out of what you got so far are you actually going to be using?
It fell apart due to inner turmoil between the editors.Those who cared about quality but heads with those mostly Prole who thought TAR should be all-inclusive and publish most of the shit that was submitted.
closing submissionsYou have no idea how to run a magazine, OP.
I'm a v good layout designer for both web and print if you need any help w that
Shoot us an email at about@ideologylit.com!
tfw want to submit but scared of rejection
Rejection sucks but it's not that bad so long as you're not waiting a long time for it. Their last day for submissions is what? Tomorrow? You won't be waiting more than a week or two since they're closing them up pretty soon.
This is gonna be such trash haha
I think its a cool idea even if the content isn't exactly the greatest.
good idea, but it's only in english, so a lot of /lit/ users, that know, like me, english just a few, can't participate, unfortunately.
this is an english language site, what do you expect?
I'm thinking about submitting a poem, but I'm worried it would be too short. It's only 10 lines, is that alright?
Nothing. It's logical it's in english, but nonetheless, there is no /lit/ board or equivalent in many language.
how is ten lines too short for a poem?
Must the submission be in english?
While we are not opposed to foreign languages in a work, the submission must be comprehensible to at least some extent in English.
Looks like shit tbh
Get a Duotrope listing.
Why not a "foreign language" part in the journal, in other languages ? It can be a good idea, no? with translation, for example
Seconding this Something like one or two foreign language pieces per issue would really diversify it
I'm not them, but I imagine the issue there would be having enough editors who can actually read through foreign language subscriptions to properly evaluate them.If this is run by primarily English speaking people, how do you expect them all to automatically be fluent in every possible language or even more than one or two?
Just translate it yourself. Why are people outside of the anglosphere so entitled?
Because you touch your wee wee at night.
The idea I had of it was that the writer indeed translates it himself and submits both the original and the translation, and if it's accepted both versions will be included
What would the point of that be? They still most likely wouldn't be able to evaluate the non-English version and if you know English well enough to translate it why not just write an English submission to begin with?I'm sure there must be some literary journals out there that handle foreign language submissions but this seems like a really tiny operation that's just starting out so you're expecting way too much from them.
what happens when you don't receive a reply?i submitted a poem via your submission applet on the website. shouldn't you send out some arbitrary message saying it was received?this wait is so stressful tbh i'm almost wishing i didn't even bother with it.
They said they wouldn't reply until after submissions closed. Also supposedly they were going to implement an automated submission received thing, but I don't know if they actually did yet or not.
I'll bite. Story on the theme of Genesis, submitted.
I guess you're rightAs a reader, I would've enjoyed seeing something other than just english though
whew, that's great news. i can calm down finally. i've been reading through my old tar pdfs, so this should be fun to make it into the first issue
if you know English well enough to translate it why not just write an English submission to begin with?Could be worthwhile for readers with an interest in translation or just languages, even if they don't speak the other very well. Still, it's a bit too out-there for them to include specific rules regarding this.
We love translations, including English translations of hitherto untranslated works by other authors.Unfortunately, we remain an English literary journal. If you decide to translate your own foreign language work into English, we will consider it, but we will only publish the English translation. We would be happy to note that it is a translation and indicate/link to the original somewhere else though.Please relax! If you used the forms on our site, we definitely received your submission. If you e-mailed us, so long as you spelled the address correctly about@idelogylit.com or submissions@ideologylit.com, we will have received your message.shouldn't you send out some arbitrary message saying it was received?they were going to implement an automated submission received thing, but I don't know if they actually did yet or notWe will be implementing this for about, submissions, and subscription emails once submissions close for #000. It's a good/standard function that we missed in hindsight.
Fuckin chill, bruh.
tfw finally submitted somethinginstantly regret not editing it moreanxiety through the roofk-k-kill me
i'm just being honest, since i don't see harm in asking. i got nice answers and it's going to become thing soon! very nice.yeah, that's the worst when you suck at handling stress, right? nothing you can do about it...
if Isubmit something that is too bad and you guys don't wanna publish it, is there a chance that you can provide feedback on the whys and hows it sucks?
They probably won't because that's too much work when you're dealing with more than a handful of submissions.
As far as possible, we try to provide all submissions with substantial thoughts and criticism. This is particularly true as we're starting out and the number of submissions we receive are manageable.That said, you should not submit something that you are not at least somewhat satisfied with--we are a literary journal, not a critique service.
did TAR ever end up doing an actual print issue?
So submissions are closed now right? When is this issue actually going to come out again? The middle of June or something?
some shitty web designer is getting retards to submit their work for free
I would submit something but I don't want to btfo your entire publication
Pastebin it then, droogy. I'm in the mood for a good laugh.
tfw secretly afraid of being rejected
dfw new-sincerely get the howling fantods at the thought of being accepted
dfwmy sideswe've actually made this man into a meme
Any language should be allowed for submission.
See above, doesn't seem to be their policy. insert your own "filthy monolingual" etc.
what timezone does submissions close? oh god why did u leave this so last minute
the name is just embarrassing
B-but the name's the only reason I even submitted something mr satan
the first issue has a fucking title and it's Genesis
Yeah that's pretty bad in and of itself, but fitting wrt the name of the journal. And it being the theme... has to start somewhere, no?
The owner literally made an ugly website and somehow is getting flooded with submissions from a bunch of faggots that will tell people they "genuinely" submitted to a "literary magazine".
The first issue isn't numbered issue 1, not even 00, it's #000. They plan on making hundreds of these.
They plan on making hundreds of these.Fuck off your shitty journal, creator of ideology
you may be the only person more retarded than the ones that came up with this thing
n-no, you-youre retarded this damage control o i am lauffin

Never.
He clearly intended "They plan on making hundreds of these" as a snide insult to the fact that they probably wont even have a second issue.But your lack of reading comprehension read it as "Oh no, this guy wants to make hundreds of these" and so drew the incorrect conclusion that her was the creator of the journal.So I agree with him, you're retarded.

I'm not, but even if I was, you still failed to comprehend a basic sentence, and so it would be irrelevant anyway.
your damage control isn't even amusing, m8
I can't wait for this to come out so I can constructively criticize all the talented writers that submitted.
sounds productive.we'll have a critique thread then.where we utterly rip them apart :^
What happened to that TAR shit you guys used to do every month?
After the first issue, why don't they have a /lit/ review/critique section, where submissions are taken for critiques of articles from the previous issue?
It lost focus and novelty
Hem, hem. I find that actually pretty interesting, if they'd oblige, and there would be the same sort of quality control, and so on, obviously, but I'd enjoy reading them, yes.
Not either of those but it's pretty obvious dudeI also vote for you being retarded
nah it ran for like forty issues before internal arguments broke it down
Is this a /lit/ thing? Or are you guys just massive fucking faggots that are advertising your journal on 4chan? If it's the former, that's pretty sweet.
they are using /lit/ as a springboard with plans to become mainstream, like TAR
Tips for better reading and avoiding distraction ?
I also want to know. I can't concentrate for more than a few seconds and I often reread the same few sentences instead of just "flowing" with the text. I don't know if I'm OCD or what.

Drop your internet.\:
that's the purpose of reading. how gave you gone this far without knowing that
read in a language that people around you don't speak
Read 5 pages a day etc etc
Enjoy and have an interest in what you're reading. If you're just reading a philosophy book because /lit/ told you so, of course you're going to get distracted. Not saying that what /lit/ recommends is shit, but in terms of reading for the sake of your own enjoyment, you're preference matters above others.

Man I sure do love Schmitt and Foucualt and Benjamin! And what? There is someone who is basically rigorously working with the both of them in a way that is pointing to new political horizons? Just got it in the mail, excited as fuck to read the first chapter on the exception Wait, why is he talking about language and parole? Why the fuck is it necessary to bring up Hegelian notions of language when talking about the exception? Fuck, now he's making reference to minor episodes in the Bible and relating them to syntagms and paradigms, which in some way apply to the example and the exception. God dammit, did he really just bring in set theory? Do you really have to keep making cryptic, paradoxical reversals of inclusion and exclusion?Interesting overall though. I can tell it's gonna take me at least a month to make it through this little book though. Anyone else here a fan of Agamben?
Have you ever considered getting a job and organising a strike?
I really want to start reading Agamben as well, but his way of writing is kind of hard to get into.Are there any shorter writings of his essays, lectures, interviews..., or any selected chapters that one could read as a sort of introduction?
Schmitt and Foucualt and Benjaminremove foucault
Homo Sacer really isn't that daunting. The only difficult section is the final section of the first part, 'Form of Law', which takes a cryptic Kafka story and "elaborates" on it in an air-thin mystical manner that seems to have no content whatsoever. The entire thing becomes much clearer with the concept of Force-of-suspendedLaw in State of Exception. Other than that it's just an interesting but disjointed study of a range of historical concepts that seem to be vaguely related to a theme and he gets a free pass on the lack of focus or coherence because the research is "cool" and the entire text is filled with strange vapour-thin concepts like 'a zone of indistinction between inside and outside'.He is not as good as Schmitt, Foucault, or Benjamin but he is the best successor to those thinkers who are otherwise neglected as a group.
the concept of Force-of-suspendedLawa zone of indistinction between inside and outsideThings like that made me think of Derrida which I have read before. I guess I should probably get better knowledge of Schmitt, Benjamin, and Arendt.He is not as good as Schmitt, Foucault, or Benjamin but he is the best successor to those thinkers who are otherwise neglected as a group.I've never really thought of grouping them either. What I'm especially interested in is how Agamben brings together biopolitics, and law and sovereignty. Foucault makes juridical and sovereign power rather distinct from biopolitics, at least in the sense that the latter is a relatively recent invention while the former two become subordinated to or overshadowed by it. As far as I understand please correct me where I'm wrong Agamben argues that on the contrary biopolitics is inherent to Western political tradition, as seen in Aristotle's definitions of zoe/bios, and that sovereignty and juridical power have not lost their importance. In what ways can this be seen?
Wait, why is he talking about language and parole? Why the fuck is it necessary to bring up Hegelian notions of language when talking about the exception?is your thought process really this much like a teenage tryhard

Says someone who's never read any of his books
I have barely been getting back into reading since the beginning of the year, having read only an embarassing eleven books all the way through out of like fifteen attempts with the majority of those being novels. Yet this tiny amount of literature at such a slow pace has already stimulated my brain in a way which is troubling. Even without reading I was an overthinker but noeiI think CONSTANTLY. I can't stop analyzing and reading into things. I was watching Bill Bye the Science Guy earlier and I seriously started thinking "Isn't this the best example of the way science uses the spectacle of religion against religion?" I did it without even trying. What the fuck is going on? I mean I wouldn't have a problem with it if the shit I was thinking about was actually worth something but so much is just psuedo intellectual bullshit like the Bill Nye thing. What do I do? I can't even enjoy shit anymore because I over think it all
Get into woodworking
wow a rare and trips in one postcongratulations, OP

you can't stop it from happening you can only keep it to yourself. Also, a thought is only pseudo intellectual if its half baked, so if you want to avoid shit opinions just think more about it.
Fuck I'm sorry for all the spelling errors I'm posting from my phone and all that Its not even a rare tho
you have to understand no one ever leaves /lit/, so when an importer of rares comes in, even if they're middling tier rares, they're still new to us
your post is so spot-on it's beautiful and has literary value
I know that feeling, you becone highly objective of the content you absorb. As a content creator I find it helpful but you gotta tap into something within you that is naturally biased so you can have a 'genuine' opinion of text instead of just a super analytical opinion which might make u look like an edgy contrarian.
you avoid becoming a pseudointellectual by becoming a genuine intellectual.though in your case, anon, it's probably not worth the attempt.
Read more philosophy
Hi op, I can relate to an eerie extent, having just gotten into reading in the last year or so. from my experience it works like this: read some books that force you to see the world differently, like starting to climb a mountain and having a higher vantage  dissect everything in your life and daily experiences to annoyingly abstract levels  stop caring about thinga that used to motivate you  worry about being naive stoner level philosopher  read more books and and reach the top of the mountain, only to reveal further higher peaks  realize your over analysis has been misguided and now aimless  mildlydepressed.jpg  decend the mountain back to the valley with the clueless plebs  head for the next mountain  repeat
Should I actually start with the Greeks or is that just a /lit/ meme? Also if I should all of the Greek thinkers or just a particular few?And wouldnt reading more philosophy just make it worse?

I know that feel OP. I can't enjoy movies like Mad Max, Avengers 2 and Ex Machina anymore now that realize the Jews use Hollywood to push their liberal ideologies.
Well, anon, seeing as practically everything in Western civilization up to the late 18th century is a development of Greek and neo-Platonic ideas, I would say it's far more than a /lit/ meme. You definitely want to read up on the Pre-socratic thinkers, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle at the very least. Then keep these readings in mind and see how they have been exemplified at various times throughout Western history.Your other question has no easy answer. I mean, that's easily where the major division in contemporary American education derives. What do you think philosophy should be, and what do you think it does?

i had an embarassing moment in the toilet when the thought of egoism somehow being a bias of the will overtook me and i had to keep flushing to trigger more thoughtsit's like you shit out a brain salad whenever certain things occur, right?
having read only an embarassing eleven books all the way through11 books in 6 monthsHow the fuck is that a slow pace? Were they all ~200 page books or something?
They were almost all between 150-250 or so and not too difficult. Also people on lit always talk about reading 200 books a year and everything
OP here i am surprised that this thread is still here. I have thought a lot about this today and I have decided that for the near future at least I am not going to read any direct philosophy and am going to limit my non fiction reading. I know this is plebby or cowardly but I'm at a point in my life where I can't bear thinking about shit like this. Perhaps I am weak
reading 200 books a yearI promise that anyone who makes that claim on 4chan is a complete liar.
Yea, unless they read like 3 hours a day.
i usually average 100 a year 200 isnt as far fetched as you might think
I know everyone is lyingIt's not that hard to read 200 books a year, depending on the books. I'm sure a lot of people here, particularly in the fall and winter, easily read that amount.
hey thanks man
thats way more than 3 hours a day. 200 books a year is 2/3 of a novel a day. That's much much more than just 3 hours worth of reading
The problem with reading 200 full length books a year is that you're probably not absorbing much and just being a fag speeding through for self-cred.
No worries there, you're already a moron for thinking that reading will turn you into an idiot. It's about what books you choose to read, not simply 'reading' itself.
Stoner level philosophyThere's more than one strain.There's more than one kind of stoner.Read more and you'll realize that.
Most people who throw around the word pseudo-intellectual harbor generally anti-intellectual sentiment. Just be who you are, don't let social pressure yes, even on 4chan dictate your hobbies because they're labelled inauthentic. The groupthink here is pretty much worse than Reddit.
you'll reach a point where you can't even enjoy comedy shows because you hate how the characters are too one dimensional and the authors always write themselves into corners and than have to use some kind of deus-ex-machina to resolve the conflict. That's where it'll start to be funny

Quit living in the past. There has never been a time in history when people have paid for things they can get for free. The internet has changed the distribution model for books permanently and if publishers want to keep profiting they will have to find other ways to do so. Possibilities include in-book advertising and subscription plans with recommended books in their area of interest.

John Milbank said that the Church in its heyday was the conduit between academic and popular. What would be the contemporary conduit? Is there such a conduit? Can such a conduit be created, or have pop culture and academics become irreconcilable?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN6UNVwlRbk
bump
If you actually wanted to discuss the content of your post you probably could have picked a better picture.As for a link between the academic and the popular, maybe any kind of particularly challenging media could pass? For example maybe the works of Cormac McCarthy or Gene Wolfe fit what you're looking for. But then again, it takes a certain kind of person to consider them popular.
Trade unionists.
Sorry if you find that the picture detracts The main purpose of it was illustrate that bridging academic philosophy and pop isn't really working, and needs some sort of accommodating medium.I mean an institution or something like that, rather than simply specific literary titles that are popular hits.Could you give some examples to illustrate your point?
Could you give some examples to illustrate your point?Yes I could, but no I won't.
then you can't
a silentio
It is obvious OP can't give examples of how priests actually worked in Europe.
There were more than priests, there were monks, who did a great deal of scholarly work and debate, and their theology, which contained all sorts of academic elements and philosophy, became accessible to the populace through the medium of priests.
which became accessibleYou know nothing about priests in Europe mate.
its called ideology
Time for you to read HegelPredominant ideology is it not a conduit, as the OP pic demonstrates.
When it comes to making claims about the past I prefer reading historians rather than dribble.
I'm talking about Hegel on the function and significance of priests and the Church, rather than his history.
So you're saying Hegel's claims about priests aren't based in history? Please do tell me more about how he has any claim to talk about external phenomena when not using the appropriate method to interrogate external phenomena?
They factor in history, but they aren't "history" as in the academic discipline any more than Genealogy of Morals is.
That's nice. When I talk about the things that happen between people, I like it to be demonstrably from appropriate reading of the documentary record.I suppose you just like lies.
you mean like a transcript?
You've never taken a history course, have you?
Yes, I have, and they are heavily influenced by ideology and implicit mind-reading.
implicit mind readingAs a history major I want to know what you mean by this
I mean projecting hypothetical, motivations, concerns and plans as factual.
He's probably ESL and talking about the hermeneutics of the documentary method.
I don't think you actually understand what history is or what the discipline tries to do. Good historians don't make factual claims about how historical figures felt, they speculate and try to come to reasonable conclusions based on knowledge of the person's context and the historian's knowledge of psychology. The only way I could see that kind of thing as at all being like mind-reading would be if you also thought that sensing other people's emotions is mind-reading, in which case you use the term too broadly.
Which would be fine, except sometimes speculations aren't stressed quite thoroughly as speculations.Sensing an emotion is sort of "mind reading" it's called "theory of mind", but social interaction is not really an academic discipline. Studying how we use theory of mind is an academic discipline, but the actual use of it is not.
sci show
except sometimes speculations aren't stressed quite thoroughly as speculations.Not all historians are honest about that kind of thing. It's also generally understood to be obviously speculation 99% of the time. In some cases, though, it just makes sense to say "This person was happy at this point."To be perfectly honest, though, if you think cataloging important people's feels is what history is about, you need to take more history classes.
If you don't think motivations and intentions are a major part of history, you need to take more history classes.
Yes, because you'll be agree'd with. You're well suited to being a historian.
any kind of particularly challenging media could pass?No, because popular culture is obvious to the challenging elements. Take A Clockwork Orange, for instance, it's just le edgy film xD

Why should one study philosophy? What are its benefits?What is the point of studying philosophy in the modern era?
If you study philosophy, you can be better at pseudo-philosophizing plebs, so when some pothead tries to talk about philosophy when he's only learned about it from those "philosophy for idiots" videos on youtube, or when some fedora man tells you that reading Plato is useless because he's not scientific like the real smarties in the world, you can tell them how full of shit they are and that they've got everything wrong.Studying philosophy will make you a better person.
you must more live philosophically, than to learn philosophy.-to live the good life-to create new conceptsyou will question thoughts, speeches and actions of every body, yours included.what are the difficulties/problems ?why are they difficulties/problems ?what are the solutions ?why are they solutions ?What are the necessities ?what are the sufficiences ?what are the causes ? what are the effects ?what are the means ? what are the goals ?And it appears that, without even discussing the solutions nor the logics and motivations of the causes and the effects, most of the problems that people discuss IRL or in their books, are vapid, incomplete, foreign.To learn philosophy is to learn why such or such philosopher created such and such concepts against such and such problems.
For fun
to become a better Human Being
To get a better perspective and breadth in your view of everything around you.Its pure curiosity.Its beyond science, beyond a career, beyond the goals dictated by whatever society you are living in.Its also a way to shed propaganda and certitudes.Its a tool for more constructive thinking, for being able to make sense of everything around you.
Including your desires and why you desire what you desire.Why you want what you want. Why is this or that problematic. Why is it that on some topics you seem to be able to agree and disagree with both sides?Its a way of becoming more conscious of everything, including yourself.
Only right answer
but how does it make someone a better person?

This b8 is too bad m8, nobody actually finds science too hard. Most find it too plain, too easy and too understandable to get interested on it.
This. Someone tell Kripke to take a biology class. Idiot.
what is the point of studying philosophy..?How can you proclaim to think when you don't even know how to frame your thoughts?
There's no end to the benefits. You'll understand much more and be able to see through much more bullshit. You'll also realize that virtually everything is posturing and nobody really knows all that much about anything

Who's your favorite philosopher that you've blue, and how big was his cock?
I appreciate your wit, Anon.
redYou're in /lit/ and don't know the past tense of read? Failed education at it's grandiose most. No morals nor virtues.
Perhaps he's not a native English speaker and just wants to know your opinion?
having a favourite philosopherLol. So pleb.

Lao Tzu, made me seek enlightenment.
that you've redWhere i come from that means killed.

Probably kierkegaard or hans urs von balthasar.Kierkegaard refined the inner nature which I was always aware of and always saw as a thing from God, but I had never known anybody else had written about it.In fact, I basically invented a couple of kierkegaard's ideas before I read him, so when I did read him I knew we were birds of a feather him and I.That was my first dealing with philosophy and ever since then most non-Christian philosophy seemed silly and incomplete..
It only feels incomplete because it doesn't crutch on a believe....
I'm sorry to have to tell you this but that's wrong.The only philosophers I've read that -haven't- crutched on anything have been Christian philosophers.What then is the ubermensch if not a crutch?It is actually an isolated movement towards Christianity, but when it is used in secular philosophy it becomes a cop-out.I don't want to sound like a dick but I have actually never met an atheist who understands God in the proper metaphysical tradition maintained by most catholic theologians.Even the basic theological writings aquinas, and the church fathers as well are misunderstood by otherwise great minds.
Philosophy doesn't change your life?
being emotionally attached to a certain aspect of philosophyThat's like saying "Oh I love gravity !, but the weak force sucks !"Stop romancizing everything morons, you are part of the problem
Nietzsche - Thus Spoke Zarathustra
Wittgenstein, now I dismiss any question about what anything is "by itself".
I'd like to read some Roman history. I'm particularly interested in reading about late Republic/early Empire. So I was thinking about reading these three books, and the Plutarch lives of the relevant people. Is there any particularly good order to read these in, or should I just pick any of them and dive in? Also any recommendations on different editions though I don't think it matters as much with history as with poetry, or if you prefer a modern history book rather than the original sources, or if there are any other histories I'm missing, let me know.ancient history pls
wanting to learn historyreading primary sources firstPoor idea. Read Tom Hollands Rubicon and move in from there. You also missed Cicero.
read them in the order they were written.also read Rubicon by Tom Holland and De Re Publica by Cicero
Cool thanks, will add these to my list. So you'd recommend reading the Holland first, then Caesar, Cicero, Plutarch, Suetonius, Appian?
yeah
If you're looking for some GOAT classics:Caesar's "The Civil War: Together with the Alexandrian War, the African War, and the Spanish War" shows all these wars from Caesar's perspectiveCaesar's "The Conquest of Gaul" shows the conquest of Gaul from Caesar's perspectiveCassius Dio's "The Reign of Augustus" naturally shows the reign of AugustusSuetonius' "The Lives of the Twelve Caesars" biographies on all the Caesars from julius to DomitianTacitus' "The Annals of Imperial Rome" shows Rome from Augustus to NeroAn absolutely GOAT book in my opinion is Gibbon's "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire." It really shows the degradation of Roman society and the Empire in relatively good detail however it basically results in Gibbons getting a hard-on for masculinity in society which can make it quite repetitive. Unless your a massive fan of Roman history you may find it's size and contents a dry read.Still waiting for the day in which a decent book comes out about the Crisis of the Third Century.
Definitely read holland first, and when you read the others remember they are heavily slanted and biased. another more modern book would be Caesar life of a Colossus and a biography of Pompeii and biography of Augustus. you might check out the podcast a history of rome that covers this time period from the Gracchi brothers to Augustus' rise to power.
Gibbon's "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire."this is excellent but only covers the age of the Antonines to the fall of Constantinople, not the late republic early empire.
Holland's Rubicon is indeed great, but I think it wouldn't hurt to try reading some Livy. He was a historian from the time of Augustus who compiled a massive history from Rome's founding up to the rise of Caesar. He's as much a secondary source as a modern day historian, although with some obvious propaganda stirred in.If you like podcasts, I'd highly recommend Mike Duncans completed The History of Rome. He covered Latin prehistory up to the fall of the western empire in year by year detail. There's a also history of Byzantium podcast that is finishing the next thousand years if the eastern empire.
Yeah I'd like to read some Livy but I thought his only surviving stuff covers early Rome?
RL Fox - The Classical WorldTom Holland - RubiconIn The Name of Rome - Adrian GoldsworthyCaeser - Adrian GoldsworthyAugustus - Anthony EverittMarcus Agrippa - Lyndsay JamesThis is your starting point. All these books overlap and take you from why Rome existed and the greek influence though to how the Republic diead and what happened next.Now start looking at the ancient and classical historians, its easy this way around as you now have a good general background and are able to read from say Tacitus or Suetonius with an understanding oh who they are talking about.
Fellow classical lads, does anyone know of any books about the ancient world of the Sumerians, the Assyrians and the Babylonians. Their whole society just sounds and looks so bizarre and has no comparison to any other society in history and the fact that they were the first empires in history also seems epic.
Livy goes through the Augustan period
Yes but it hasn't survived, it only still exists up to book 45 out of 142.
Is Adrian Goldsworthy good? I want to read his Punic Wars.
yeah he's alrightA History of Ancient Egypt by Nicolas GrimalCultural atlas of Mesopotamia and the ancient Near East by Michael RoafThe Kingdom of the Hittites by Trevor BryceAncient Iraq by Georges RouxEarly Mesopotamia: Society and Economy at the Dawn of History by J.N. Postgate
'From the Gracchi to Nero: a history of Rome from 133 B.C. to A.D. 68' is exactly what you want.
Rubicon is fucking great, but the fall of the Republic era is way too overplayed. I want something that tells of the fall of kingdoms and the rise of the SPQR.
Not really. Only if you're looking for a monarchist Tory interpretation. I'll have to defer to the othersBumping for pre-republic Italy
The Cambridge Companion to the Roman RepublicFlower's Companion is primarily addressed to those with interest but little background in Roman history, offering “an introduction to the Republic that tries not to privilege a particular time period or point of view,” but instead providing “a guide to a variety of areas, fields of study, and possible approaches that are currently being explored.”http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=4c719c74ea4f24eb975136fc8d1f1d15

Wow, just read this and I'm fucking depressed now1: Can someone interpret this? Or give me the link to an article interpreting this? I feel like there's more to it than just what I read2: What book of Kafka do I read next?
it's about becoming a NEET
No, it's about becoming a bug.
Wow, just read this and I'm fucking depressed nowI'm not surprised.1: Can someone interpret this?Sure. Grete was the one who had to take on 'a traditional gender role', She had to clean Gregor's room, she had to bring in his daily meals. It shows the female role is just to provide food and a clean house. The male role was to work, support the family, and to control. Kafka uses point of view of Grete to point out the necessity of gender equality.Gradually the story shifts from Gregor's perspective to Grete's perspective. Gregor's transformation forces Grete to fill the hole left by Gregor and create her own point of view, whereas before she mindlessly obeys everyone's commands. At the beginning of the story, Kafka has Grete obeying commands without any questioning or inquiry. She does not possess a sense of self because she never experiences the need for independence before Gregor's metamorphosis.As Gregor slowly diminishes, Grete gains her self-confidence and forms her own opinions because Gregor can no longer bring home the money and keep the family functioning. Taking a stand, she decides the fate of Gregor when the family can withstand the bug no longer, and she states, "'we can't go on like this. If you can't see it, I can... We have to try to get rid of it'". For once, she takes the opportunity to situate her thoughts into a plan of action, even rising above the patriarch father and challenging his opposition. With the downsized view of male Gregor, Kafka reveals the power behind a once oppressed female Grete; therefore, the removal of the unbalanced gender household allows Grete to form her own opinions, uncover her own strength, and become liberated.
kill yourself
Great post. Top notch. Excellent work. Thick, solid, tight.
wow this interpretation is objectively the worst thing I've ever read on this board
i assume it's piss-taking
gr8 troll m8. gregor is the only one willing to empower grete,
dfw youre not sure if b8 or a serious feminist school critique
wow this interpretation is objectively the worst thing I've ever read on this board*wow this interpretation doesn't fit my adopted semantic narrative, so I will label it with the negative tag 'worst' to voice my connotation, misuse the word 'objective' for hyperbolic emphasis, and present my argument in an un-punctuated, lowercase, snide dismissal, because I am Intellectually unable to present a rebuttal, though I managed to refrain from using 'tumblr' as the center of my dismissal.FTFY
Your interpretation finds no basis in textual evidence, and evidently originates from your own views; which you know to be suspect because you reflexively brought up "tumblr" as an argument against it even though it hasn't appeared once in the thread.
You mad.Youre looking at it from one side only, and to make it worse you pick the most contraversial one. Last of all this is a shit interpretation due to the fact that grete was never forced to clean gregors room, she was the one closest to him. And parent not being able to make the decision of throwing out gregor is only because they dont want to be against grete, whos help they desperatly need. Pardon my shit english, just started.
newfag doesnt recognize copy pasta
no basis in textual evidencea post which cites dialogue and events in the textMaybe I misremember, but doesn't the story close with the mother and father observing Grete stretching, remarking that soon she will begin to be courted and married? Surely that expresses a far more cynical view of the end Grete's transformations come to.
u got mewhat I've learnt about /lit/ in a week: -we don't like bukowski
Not my post, but this guy gave a pretty good analysis in this post in the corn thread:
I would call that a pretty ordinary analysis, not a good one. That anon loosely strung together events in the text without any real analysis or even explanation in what way does the reveal of Grete's being a plen at the violin support this?, arriving at a conclusion that is plainly obvious to anyone who reads the book: Kafka hates himself and thinks he is holding the people he loves and hates back.You don't have to shock and appall when you analyze, but you have to display something not immediately obvious to make the analysis worthwhile. If not, it's not good analysis.
So what would you say qualifies as a good analysis for this? makes bombastic assertions that fall apart when examined closely and  apparently falls short of good because it doesn't make a daring logical leap that may or may not be correct
Speaking personally, I don't really like any deep symbolic readings of Kafka. He writes bizarre stories and to interpret the bizarreness as a metaphor is to distance yourself from the strangeness of the text. My interpretation of the play is that an unhappy, put-upon man gets turned into a cockroach, becoming even more miserable. I don't think there's that much more to it than that, though I love the story.All that said, there's a somewhat famous Nabokov interpretation of the story that's pretty fun: http://www.kafka.org/index.php?id=191,209,0,0,1,0
A good analysis, in general, is one which rigorously cites and refers to the text to support an original thesis. The first post does not rigorously adhere to the text, but has a relatively original thesis, at least in the context of /lit/ there are feminist readings of literally everything in academic settings.The second post does not adhere to the text either in any but the broadest strokes, and does not advance an original or even interesting thesis that one would not get from just reading the book. It amounts to nothing other than validation that, yes, you read the Metamorphosis and got what the point was, good job. That's not analysis, that's reading a book.One is ideological, vague and provocative, the other is bland, vague, and comforting. Take your pick faglord, but neither are terribly good.
tfw anyone enrolling in an English degree from now on will have to write all of their papers from this POV.
missing the symbolism
Didnt nabokov say its just fantasy?I think you should be depressed if u can relate to gregor, its a dark and well written story, i like it, i think it has many aspects of symbolism and ive never read any other kafka
Nabokov is a hack, so who cares what he has to say?
You are a retard, so who cares what you have to say?
8/10 troll I tittered
What do you think about Chomsky aside from the Harris thing? And where should you start with his books? Anyone got a chart?
Anyone got a chart?why is /lit/ filled with retards
You sure are a cynical little shit, you should find another shtick that one sees as much use as your piss jars in the closet.
Top notch con manI'm a big fan
Anyone got a chart?is this /mu/?start with syntactic structures and then stop, it's the only thing he wrote worth reading, beside maybe his book on propaganda. the rest of it is muh imperialismheres a free linkhttp://lingo.stanford.edu/sag/papers/lees-rev.pdf
Manufacturing Consent and Understanding Power are two go-to Chomsky works
Care to explain?
oops wrong link here ya gohttp://jpkc.whut.edu.cn/yyxdl/uploadfiles/mzxd/Syntactic_Structures.pdf
He Writes books and gives lectures highly critical of the military - while making millions off his work for the militaryHis 'best work', Manufacturing Consent, calls corporate marketing propaganda and decries it. Then and now he makes millions as a consultant helping corporations create better marketingHe promotes higher taxes on the rich, but pays no taxes on his millions because he uses shelters and trustsThe 'tenured professor who promotes anarchy' is just funnyall part of the public record, well proven, and admitted publicly by ChomskyI admire his boldness
Citations?
The best is probably the book Do As I Say Not a As I Do; well-footnoted and acknowledged by Chomsky as accurate.
i wrote a paper on 'culture of terrorism' in prep, i thought it was pretty good but then again i was in my anarchist-crust-punk phase
What do you think about Chomsky aside from the Harris thing?implying Chomsky has any relevance aside from his 10 seconds of fame - a footnote to the greatest philosopher of all time
You're best listening to his album speeches at first. That's a good introduction.
What does Chomsky have to do with Aristotle?
In all seriousness now OP, this article is quite good; Chomsky is quite polemic by nature and I think you need some balance to read him without getting frustrated -at least for an agnostic like myself. I could see someone finding him charismatic if they already agree with all he says.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/innateness-language/
implying Aristotle wasn't almost always wrongAyn Rand also said Aristotle was the greatest philosopher of all time too, and you know what her work is like.
he's a dummy
rand was messed up but even a blind squirrel can find a nut
The joke-----------Your empty skull
oh the irony
Half convinced this is a samefag
Babby's first ideologue.
The best is probably the book Do As I Say Not a As I Do; well-footnoted and acknowledged by Chomsky as accurate.But the charge itself is silly. It's not Chomsky's fault the Pentagon funds MIT. It's not like he interviewed for a job working for the military as Noam Chomsky Inc., the way his critics want to make out.
You should google the interview Bachem Macuno did with him. Very enlightening.
why's it so hard for you guys to determine who is full of shit and who is not full of shiti mean look at him
If you're interested in his linguistic work you should read his "The Minimalist Program" from 1995; that's the most recent revolution in chomskyan linguistics. There are a lot of detractors to the research program, so you should also look at "The Structure of Unscientific Revolutions," and article by three vociferous critics.
But he has also purposefully plied for mikitary grants, joined groups on military projects, etc.He has actively sought work for the DoD and corporations for millions.So -you're incorrect
harris BTFOd him
It's not Chomsky's fault the Pentagon funds MIT.Great defense. "The military is evil but I'll working for an institution they fund because, you know, I'm clinically allergic to any place that isn't the MIT."If really he didn't want any contact with them he'd simply resign, it's not like he can't afford it right now.
Can we all at least agree that he's got an amazing smug smile?
Young chomsky was so fucking qt.
Was going to say the same.
I don't really know how much of what is said against him is true. But even if it's ALL true, I don't think it amounts to the kind of hypocrisy his critics would like to imagine. He's not critical of the military; he's critical of US policy. Do you have any evidence that he sets the policy he opposes? Because that would be hypocrisy.
Working at an institution funded by the Pentagon, but not actually producing anything that can be used for violence - and in fact committing much of one's career to speaking out against the Pentagon - is a bad thing.Idiot
Hey, I'm not the one pretending to be an intellectual and still working on the payroll of an institution I pretend is bad. Chomcuck can be a shill all he wants, but being a shill and pretending to be an intellectual and still woking for the guys you supposdly oppose as an intellectual is pretty high on the bad intellectual hygiene scale. It's not about violence, it's about not being a class-A fraud. I hope Chomchom has a good rationale for this.Or are you going to pretend that Chomsky's work at MIT did anything to mitigate the Pentagon's use of violence ? "Speaking out against the Pentagon" when you're simply getting internet points for it and not changing anything is simply bribing your way into a comfortable position. From here it just looks like he's comfy being a proeminent fraud. Not that I don't understand the appeal of it, but let's not judge a MIT professor by the standards of a sleazy 4channer.
he's not critical of the military Proven - you either haven't read him much or you're a fucking liar
He applied for grants; i.e. Volunteered, to make the military more combat effective in Vietnam.He SOUGHT OUT grants and programs working for the military and corporations and made millions doing it.All the while selling books and lectures about the problems with the military, corporations, and the rich
This is because the military grants money for pretty much anything to do with the middle east nowadays and don't really need results. I can get military grants for studying Arabic or Farsi without any obligations.
ignoring Chomsky's grants were for combat efficiency in Vietnam while Chomsky was protesting Vietnamnot talking about Chomsky's ongoing work on corporate marketing while he writes books calling corporate marketing vile propagandaTypical
Also- not talking about How Chomsky has tax attorneys, tax accountants, trusts, etc. then charges thousand of dollars plus airfare and lodging! to tell college kids 'Capitalism is fascism'
Proven - you either haven't read him much or you're a fucking liarI haven't read that much of him, I prefer to listen to him speak. Tons of stuff available on iTunes, btw. But I think you and others are falling for a deceptive reduction. He's not critical of the military, he is critical of the US foreign policy that uses the military for it's ends. This is a pretty crucial and readily appreciable difference. Right?
Also- not talking about How Chomsky has tax attorneys, tax accountants, trusts, etc. then charges thousand of dollars plus airfare and lodging! to tell college kids 'Capitalism is fascism'Is that a direct quote?
Paraphrase of a rather famous quote
Chomsky called theUS military 'One of the most evil institutions in world history'. He wrote the U.S. Army is 'a menace to all life on earth' and 'the most hideous institution on Earth'. And that's just in one book.Try again
He doesn't know what a market it
Paraphrase of a rather famous quoteIt's a poor paraphrasing, though. Corporate interests DO exert outsize influence over our democratic process. This doesn't really reduce to 'Capitalism is fascism,' though.Chomsky called theUS military 'One of the most evil institutions in world history'. He wrote the U.S. Army is 'a menace to all life on earth' and 'the most hideous institution on Earth'. And that's just in one book.Did he say the military, or the pentagon? Which is to say, the policymakers, as I said?Try againDo.
Hey, he posted it again!Look, pal, that book is meaningless.
I don't see how calling some corporations and their actions fascistic is the same as calling capitalism fascism
Read it again: he is speaking of the system of Capitalism, not corporations. Did he say the military, or the pentagon? Does it matter when his grant applications were sent to, reviewed by, approved by, and paid by the Pentagon?You still are not discussing his long-time work with corporations remember them , from your own post which this is a response to? to make their marketing more effective while calling it propaganda.We could branch out to his defense of the Khmer Rouge, if you like.
re-read from 'The system of Capitalism'.He then describes Capitalism as a system.He then states that it is economic fascism.Thus, he is calling 'the system of Capitalism' fascistic.This is /lit/, this shouldn't be difficult.
Sure.But the facts that it states remain true.
Harris didn't get BTFO'd as badly as a lot of /lit/ thinks. Chomsky was mostly just being defensive and completely dodging the spirit of the discussion Harris wanted to have, instead focusing on nit picking errors in Harris's reading of him.
Read it again: he is speaking of the system of Capitalism, not corporations.He is speaking about the deleterious effects of corporate influence on democracy. Which is pretty well established. He may describe himself as a libertarian socialist, but this doesn't mean he has to give away all his possessions. He lives in a capitalist society.Does it matter when his grant applications were sent to, reviewed by, approved by, and paid by the Pentagon?You still are not discussing his long-time work with corporations remember them , from your own post which this is a response to? to make their marketing more effective while calling it propaganda.Yes. There is no real hypocrisy in working for the military and being critical of military policy. Lots of soldiers do it. It's the same with corporations. It would be worse to feel as he does and not say anything for the love of a paycheck.We could branch out to his defense of the Khmer Rouge, if you like.After you.
Harris didn't get BTFO'd as badly as a lot of /lit/ thinks. Chomsky was mostly just being defensive and completely dodging the spirit of the discussion Harris wanted to have, instead focusing on nit picking errors in Harris's reading of him.Harris got a 'Property of Chomsky' tattoo on his ass, no doubt.
Why are you repeating this lie? Why is this thread happening again? Is this board about YouTube video meme snarkers, or about real writers and thinkers. Sam Harris needs cutting apart like a person of color trailed over rocks by a truck.
He's a great linguist but that doesn't make him qualified to be what he is marketed as.
Fuck off pleb, your kids' cunts are for my knife to taste.
Start with John Lyons, then move on to Andrew Radford, and then you will be able to read and understand Chomsky, but bear in mind that he's not the be all and end all of linguistics. It's not a bad idea to read the works of functionalists. Discourse analysis and computational linguistics are very interesting as well
He is speaking about the deleterious effects of corporate influence on democracyThis does not jibe with the direct quote of"..under Capitalism we can't have Democracy..."Or"...Capitalism is not fit for the modern world..."or"...Capitalism [is] a new and unanticipated system of injustice..."and more, besides.So your rather weird interpretation of his clear meaning is not supproted by reading his other works.There is no real hypocrisy in working for the militarySo you think a guy that charges $12,000 to tell college kids that the Pentagon is "'One of the most evil institutions in world history'; 'a menace to all life on earth'; 'the most hideous institution on Earth';While making millions from that same group for making them more efficient in their work is fine by you because, after all, a millionaire has gotta' eat?Remember! He was actively seeking out work for 'one of the most evil institutions in world history'!Like I said - he's bold. And I think it is absolutely brilliant as a huckster. It takes a lot of skill to do what he does. But I think it is pretty obvious he doesn't believe what he says.
Sam Harris - intellectually 1 step above authors of fad diet books and mad that he's three steps below them in income.
Learn to talk like that from the cabbies taking you to your parents' house to do your laundry?
So your rather weird interpretation of his clear meaning is not supproted by reading his other works.My reading is sound. The fact remains that he didn't say what you ascribed to him. He's said a lot. Use quotes.In sin =/= with sin. I don't think you're very educated on Christianity, so I wouldn't engage with me in opposition on that topic unless you just want to learn something.What I said is it is not really hypocrisy. He is critical of military policy. He doesn't set it.Like I said - he's bold. And I think it is absolutely brilliantAgreed.

He was talking about the influence of capital on politics. Chomsky doesn't own any Congressmen. If you can find evidence of Chomsky directly funding something he's opposed to and not just making a living by doing communications research paid for by the Pentagon the only goddam institution in his society that would even care about that kind of thing-I mean, seriously, who else do you want scientists to work for but the state? you're going to have a hard time selling me on your major premise Chomsky is as bad as the capitalist fascists he criticizes and not just your minor premise Chomsky doesn't discuss his finances when giving talks.
when I use quotes from his works you ask me to......use quotes. At this point I think you're just trolling. Since I can pick up one of his books and read for myself that he does not think civilization can survive Capitalism. I can read the direct quotes I gave you. Who should I believe about what he said, you? Or him?
Wrong. The "most evil institution" quote was referring to the pentagon, i.e. the policymakers. And yes, there is quite a significant difference.muh chumsky MIT hypocracyI'm a certified Chomsky loremaster, and at 1:05:52 of this video a student brings up this apparent contradiction and Chomsky swiftly blows him and that line of reasoning the fuck out.https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8?t=1h5m52s
Cooperation with evil in the act of evil is evil.If Chomsky believes the Pentagon is evil which he has and that the wars it wages are morally wrong which he has then assisting them in their wars which he's done is morally wrong.Of course, my point is that this just proves Chomsky is a liar and a hypocrite which he has admitted
So - are you agreeing his conning the gullible is brilliant?
My premise us not'Chomsky is evil'!My point is 'Chomsky is an admitted huckster'Pointing out a man says things he doesn't believe doesn't mean I think he's a fascist, it means I know he's dishonest.
who else do you want scientists to work for but the state?This probably needs elaboration. Chomsky's work was done during Vietnam, as you like to point out. Do you have any idea what kind of communications revolution was happening because of research being funded by the Pentagon? There really weren't computers in every phone and no one had cell phones. Satellites weren't used for everything like they are now. Communications and general signal research was kind of a niche field until recent technological innovations really made the field go in a pretty unexpected direction. While the facts in the one chapter of the one source you've posted at least three times in as many threads may be true, the narrative you spin is more misleading than anything Chomsky says. Inb4 'Hey, I ADMIRE him for making KIDS look STUPID!' Also, the mere existence of a Goodreads review and a Wikipedia page don't really make the book seem earth-shattering. If you could provide more evidence of bad shit Chomsky has done, I'd be willing to listen, but this is basically an irrelevant point that you don't realize most leftists can easily look past not necessarily because they're idiots who don't realize Chomsky has money and worked for the government he criticizes the most, but because they don't really object to either of those things per se. Leftists don't even dislike hypocrisy. I'm not sure who you think you're going to convince by mentioning that book which only has one chapter about Chomsky, by the way every chance you get.
...and he works for the policy makers I don't think an infantry sergeant at Ft. Bragg is approving his grant. Do you?And all he does is deflect; in public communications he has admitted to all of this. Why?It is all public record.You're splitting hairs in a failed attempt to defend a con man
do you believe your own rhetoric?it basically boils down to: "either you are plotting imminent insurrection or must praise all aspects of capitalism"i think the military does bad shit but if they offered me a grant and weren't telling me what to do, why would i refuse? they'll just give our tax dollars away to someone worse, more docile, etc. use the enemy's resources to fight.if i believed the government is fundamentally bad and shouldn't be taking their money because UNCLEAN, why would i attempt to give them more money in taxes if the system is set up to escape this obligation? should i only let amoral assholes starve the government?you've never worked a day in your life. you are clearly 16 years old.
Chomsky is an admitted hucksterI don't think that even has a basis. Who is he scamming? Are you claiming that his books have no value at all, or that his knowledge is worthless? I don't think that making money off of your own work by selling it to people who want to read it makes someone a huckster.
I don't think he makes anyone -look- stupidAre you the guy who repeats ad infinitumyes, I know it is all trueyes, these are all factualyes, I know he's a hypocrite who probably doesn't believe half of what he saysbut he's still awesome?Because I don't think Chomsky is evil or even really a bad guy. But when you discuss political writing the fact that the author doesn't believe/follow the things he advocates are actually important to understanding and evaluating the work.
it basically boils down to: "either you are plotting imminent insurrection or must praise all aspects of capitalism"Don't bother, you're arguing with a fucking moron. According to him anyone who critiques the government is a hypocrite if they don't live like hunter-gathers.
when I use quotes from his works you ask me to......use quotes.At this point I think you're just trolling.I'm not. If you had used actual quotes to begin with, I wouldn't have said anything.Since I can pick up one of his books and read for myself that he does not think civilization can survive Capitalism. I can read the direct quotes I gave you. Who should I believe about what he said, you? Or him?You should believe that he has said what you read or hear him say, not what someone paraphrases.
What?No, I don't think"either you are plotting imminent insurrection or must praise all aspects of capitalism"I have said nothing extreme whatsoever.I'm just pointing out that Chomsky is rather hypocritical and often dishonest. That's it. i think the military does bad shit but if they offered me a grant and weren't telling me what to do, why would i refuse? they'll just give our tax dollars away to someone worse, more docile, etc. use the enemy's resources to fightYeah, but do you make thousands of dollars telling people the Pentagon is 'one of the most evil institutions in human history'? Noam does.why would i attempt to give them more money in taxes if the system is set up to escape this obligation?Do you lecture and say that rich people should pay more taxes when you are both rich and not paying taxes? No?Noam does.I am not calling him a creature from the pit of Hell, I am calling a conman and huckster. And I have no idea why people freak out about this. it is all public record and not that big a deal. Just - take what he says with a huge grain of salt.
Cooperation with evil in the act of evil is evil.So if you pay taxes to pay for evil acts, you are evil?If Chomsky believes the Pentagon is evil which he has and that the wars it wages are morally wrong which he has then assisting them in their wars which he's done is morally wrong.That depends on the nature of his work. Regardless, it doesn't make him a hypocrite.Of course, my point is that this just proves Chomsky is a liar and a hypocrite which he has admittedWhen did he admit this?
So - are you agreeing his conning the gullible is brilliant?I agree that he's brilliant; I don't think he's conning anybody.
When a televangelist with 4 mistresses, a cocaine habit, 4 mansions, 2 private jets, and a $6k Italian suit flies into a small town and asks the locals to give him money for the good and moral work his ministry does,He's a huckster.When a multi-millionaire with 2 mansions, tax attorneys, tax accountants, a trust fund, a contract with WalMart an example to help their marketing, and a contract with the DoD, charges a college $10k + travel& expenses to fly in and tell them the DoD is evil, corporations are enslaving you with marketing, rich people should pay more taxes, and please buy my new book on how property rights are bad...he's a huckster.
i know. while i do wonder if he's just trolling more likely a butthurt harrisfag, i responded more because i see this type of rhetoric quite commonly and it results in children with ideals completely flipping and becoming twenty-somethings at investment banks, constantly self-justifying and basically self-hypnotizing, repeating mantras in an attempt to forget they ever thought there was something more important than being a moneylender. the lack of a middle ground forces everyone into line
So you are claiming:"..under Capitalism we can't have Democracy..."Or"...Capitalism is not fit for the modern world..."or"...Capitalism [is] a new and unanticipated system of injustice..."are NOT Chomsky quotes?You suck at lying.http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Capitalism+%5Bis%5D+a+new+and+unanticipated+system+of+injustice&l=1http://lmgtfy.com/?q=under+Capitalism+we+can%27t+have+Democracy&l=1Go away, terrible liar.
your claim that he is hypocritical rests on not taking the money of people you opposeif i could say that the pentagon was evil and take their money, who is being conned? taking money does not equal love. you will learn this when you stop living with your parents.i believe the rich should pay more, in that they should be forced to pay more; the system should change to force this. until this happens, why should i not use the system in the way it is set up?"i love noam - he's brilliant at fooling people!" - this is not a bad rhetorical strategy as you don't have an argument here so it's better to deflectthere is no other explanation for this behaviour than you desperately wanting to tongue sam harris' asshole. it's not funny enough to be a troll
According to him anyone who critiques the government is a hypocrite if they don't live like hunter-gathersHa!You know, I have said over and over the same points 1 I don't care how much money Chomsky has2 I don't care how he makes his money3 I don't care how he spends his money4 I don't care how much tax he pays5 I don't think he's evil6 I don't care if he keeps doing anything he has been doingYou just keep making shit up about what I think long after I say again and again and again exactly what I *DO* think.'It is a fact that he is hypocritical and dishonest.The end. I never call for him to be punished, or stripped of his job, or even forced to change his ways.Meh. Don't even know the guy.But! When someone says"Hey, what do oyu think of Chomsky's work?"I say"well, he probably doesn't believe it himself, because he is a proven and admitted hypocrite who is probably doing all of this for the cash so keep that in mind while reading his stuff"That's it. Hell, I think it is pretty ballsy to do what he does!I *amazed* by how people freak out, like I want him harmed, or something.Nope. Not at all. Why would I? I think most people in politics are saying a lot of things they don't actually believe.
So if you pay taxes to pay for evil acts, you are evil?I thought you vaguely claimed to know something about Christianity?You're the terrible liar, aren't you?Mk 12:17
When a televangelistChomsky isn't a televangelist you silly chucklefuck. His books aren't gospel that you must accept only faith. Chomsky is not a theorist either. Every single indictment he makes about America is backed up with copious amounts of research and FACTUAL EVIDENCE.
/No middle ground'?I'm not saying 'shoot the guy'I'm saying 'take what he says carefully because he doesn't seem to believe it himself'
I LOVE JEWS THEY ARE SO GOOD AT MANIPULATING INTERNATIONAL FINANCEI LOVE BLACKS AND HOW THEY DON'T CARE TO LIVE IN POLITE SOCIETYI LOVE WHITES, THEY WERE VERY CLEVER IN SETTING UP A SYSTEM OF PRISON CAMPS FOR THE BLACKSI LOVE THE CHINESE, FOOTBINDING WAS BRILLIANT, IN CIVILIZED SOCIETY, WOMEN SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WALKI LOVE THE FRENCH, THEY HAVE SUCH A REFRESHINGLY RELAXED ATTITUDE TO BATHING
But when you discuss political writing the fact that the author doesn't believe/follow the things he advocates are actually important to understanding and evaluating the work.I don't necessarily think Chomsky disbelieves in any of the things he says. You assume that because he's wealthy and did research for the Pentagon he must not believe his own theories about injustice and power. This is patently false. He's opposed to the influence of money on the democratic process, not to individuals making money off of their own work. See my point in :If you could provide more evidence of bad shit Chomsky has done, I'd be willing to listen, but this is basically an irrelevant point that you don't realize most leftists can easily look past not necessarily because they're idiots who don't realize Chomsky has money and worked for the government he criticizes the most, but because they don't really object to either of those things per se. Leftists don't even dislike hypocrisy.He doesn't think America is Satanic or anything like that. If you actually paid attention to what he says, you would know that.
None of the content of your post had anything to do with Chomsky until the last sentence
What doesn't he believe, exactly? Can you give us actual quotes from Chomsky instead of just your nonsense about loving how much of a shyster he is? You don't seem to actually understand the man's thought at all, the only quote you've presented ITT was the one about fascism, and you didn't understand that at all because you live in Liechtenstein and don't understand American politics.
Sam harris?Dude, I wrote thisGuess what? I just think people should be leery of political writings where the author obviously doesn't believe what he is writing.And yeah - a guy that calls the Pentagon 'one of the most evil institutions in human history' while going out of his way to work for them probably doesn't really believe that they are all that bad.i believe the rich should pay more, in that they should be forced to pay more; the system should change to force this. until this happens, why should i not use the system in the way it is set up?Because that is hypocrisy.And remember; Noam could get a tenured chair at virtually any university in the English-speaking world making a really nice six-figure+ income and could have for the last, oh, 30+ years, with his book royalties and speaking fees on top. Why go shasing after all of those extra grants, contracts, and such if he *really* thinks Capitalism is incompatible with democracy when is already has more than enough money to be in the top 205, even 10% of Americans?I mean that's fine, more power to him. But if he REALLY believed all that stuff wouldn't $300-$400k a year be enough?
Equating MIT and the Pentagon that dishonestlyKid pls, it's like you don't know anything about the way research works
Harris actually 'won' that 'debate'.
And yeah - a guy that calls the Pentagon 'one of the most evil institutions in human history' while going out of his way to work for them probably doesn't really believe that they are all that badUhhhWhy go shasing after all of those extra grants, contracts, and such if he *really* thinks Capitalism is incompatible with democracy Again, you're confusing Chomsky's criticisms of capital's control of American democracy with hatred of market exchanges.
you have no idea how a grant even works!i am applying for a grant of around 100K right nowthis money will go to run a research projecti hire interpreters, run symposia, hire RAs, fly myself and other people around economy class - i don't make any moneyyou are a moronic child - you know nothing of the world and your response is "everything is shit, everyone is covered with filth, so the only non-hypocritical response is to work for a bank and love it"if you're not leading an insurrection right now, shut the fuck up and learn about the world
Well, since he is responsible for the creation of a lot of the propaganda he claims to oppose, perhaps that is correct.Would you evaluate the veracity of this statement by Chomsky in 'Language and Politics'?“the Sandinistas, among these Central American countries, are unique inthat the government doesn’t slaughter its population.”
The 'He's a huckster' part?well, glad to see you agree.[Or is your reading/writing that bad?]
since he is responsible for the creation of a lot of the propaganda he claims to opposeWhat are you talking about?
You DO know that he's seeks out contracts with the Pentagon and corporations, right?You ALSO know he has been repeatedly offered jobs at other universities where they don't take DoD funding, right?Right?
"everything is shit, everyone is covered with filth, so the only non-hypocritical response is to work for a bank and love it"WTeverlovingF are you talking about?!FFS, I just said the guy is a hypocrite so take his politics lightly!TheEndwhat the fuck is wrong with you people. Criticizing some weirdo professor != nihilism
It seems you missedStop being lazy and read the thread and follow the links
the best way to fight a system is to delude yourself that you've done as much as possible to isolate yourself from it
I'm not saying I agree, I'm just saying you used the word Chomsky in the sentence. My larger point was that you don't have a point and your arguments are babby-tier.You ALSO know he has been repeatedly offered jobs at other universities where they don't take DoD funding, right?You do realize he might like MIT and appreciate all that defense do$h he uses to research stuff with all the resources available at MIT, right? You do realize that MIT is pretty much an ideal research environment, right?
He contracts with corporations to help them improve their marketing effectiveness. he calls corporate marketing propaganda.
he contracts with corporations to help them improve their marketing effectiveness.Citation please.
you live in LiechtensteinWTF?!I live in Atlanta! I am up with a sick kidLichtenstein?!
You do know that the idea of capitalism and democracy being at odds with each other is basic leftism, right? What exactly are we supposed to find apalling about those quotes?
...you're not mentioning the DoD...
and i am saying that your proofs of hypocrisy are nothing of the sort"if one is to have the state largely as it is, the system should be changed so that people like me will be forced to pay more taxes" ~= "people like me should as a personal decision, pay more taxes voluntarily"
I don't see what those quotes are supposed to prove other than that Chomsky is a libertarian socialist living in a capitalist society. Could you explain what you wanted to prove other than that so that I can follow your reasoning? You clearly think you're smarter than me, it shouldn't be too hard for you.
Why should I? You've already demonstrated that you don't know how funding works.
The first step in fighting a system is to stop seeking out more ways to participate with it, especially in ways that make it more efficientOr do you think MLK should have, I don't know, taken money from the Democratic Party to help them pass more Jim Crow laws?
I am a poor reader and writerFTFYChomsky is a multi-millionaire with two million dollar plus homes, etc.
Well, for certain values of Left, sure.
you're doing this thing that americans do where they just say whatever because "it's an argument; i'm trying to win"i hope you're american, otherwise you must be very lonely in your own society
Well, the benadryl has kicked in, the little guy is asleep, and I will be going to bed soon.There is a quote in this thread that this thread proves is trueLeftists don't even dislike hypocrisy.Obviously!
Huh, I guess you just don't like to give meaningful responses.
There is no argument going on here.At lest, I don't think so.The quotes from Chomsky are accurate.The facts of his income, etc. are well-established.I think it is obvious he is a hypocrite and a huckster.Now, a lot of people in this thread seem to think that either doing the opposite of what you claim to believe isn't hypocritical or that they don't care, which is all fine.And some other weirdos seem to think that my belief that Noam is a hypocrite somehow means I am a nihilist or think he's evil, or think I'm from Lichtenstein ?, etc., but I have no idea where that comes from.Seriously - look. My posts are mainly-He really said that-He really did that-no, I don't think xNow, I think thethe best way to fight a system is to delude yourself that you've done as much as possible to isolate yourself from itBusiness is pretty odd; I do my very best to avoid people/groups/etc. I think are evil, but this appears to not be how others think.Maybe that's why they like Noam's stuff, I don't know
Is 'an ideal research environment' worth cooperating with something you think is one of the worst evils in human history?Would you work there if you had to work with, oh, the Khmer rouge?
Is 'an ideal research environment' worth cooperating with something you think is one of the worst evils in human history?Someone already posted a video where Chomsky addresses this. You haven't responded to that post yet. Would you work there if you had to work with, oh, the Khmer rouge?Probably, if I loved my work enough. I'm an American, I know what my government does, but I'd still take its money, since money is just something g you need to survive in a capitalist society.
So you are claiming:"..under Capitalism we can't have Democracy..."Or"...Capitalism is not fit for the modern world..."or"...Capitalism [is] a new and unanticipated system of injustice..."are NOT Chomsky quotes?You suck at lying.I don't know if those are quotes or not, but I wasn't disputing them. What I asked whether it was a direct quote or not was the earlier stated 'Capitalism is fascism,' and as it turns out I was right to suspect it wasn't.Don't you think you should apologize for calling me a liar?
So if you pay taxes to pay for evil acts, you are evil?I thought you vaguely claimed to know something about Christianity?You're the terrible liar, aren't you?Mk 12:17I'm just seeing how you react when your own logic traces this associative evil directly back to you.
I don't know why, but Harris gets on my nerves. His logic is more often than not fairly solid, but he's such a faggot about it.
Chumpsky gets on my nerves by wearing the same god damn shirt for the last 40 years.
i.e., he got all this money from the military and spent it in non-military purposes. He's been deviating the Pentagon's funds into fruitless shit so that they spend less in actual war.
This2015Not understanding how research funding works
Harris' "logic" is fairly solid to the extent that it serves his needs for publicity. He doesn't give a shit about what's true, he just pretends to.
Someone can't read
You're responding to a post with links to the source of the quotes in it"I don't know if those are quotes or not"Your earlier post says "If you had used actual quotes to begin with, I wouldn't have said anything."Now you say"I wasn't disputing them"You are obviously a liar
Political economy of human rights if you want to know what he actually said about CambodiaNot the uncited claims every one makes
Not sure what you mean by that. That whole post seemed an apt response to your nonsense.
what? elaborate
Your earlier post says "If you had used actual quotes to begin with, I wouldn't have said anything."And I wouldn't have. What I said something about was you saying he tells college kids 'Capitalism is fascism,' which evidently I was right to question because that is not an actual Chomsky quote.You are obviously a liarYou are calling me a liar when I haven't lied. Show me where you mistakenly think I have, or apologize like the adult I'm sure you would like to think you are, or reveal yourself as the only liar and hypocrite in all your charges of lies and hypocrisy in this thread.
I'm really loving it. Haven't read anything Greek or Roman before though. I'm thinking I should probably read the Odyssey and the Iliad?
damn this board is useless
Homer is great and all but not really related to Marcus Aurelius. Epictetus was the greatest Stoic and certain of Plato's dialogues were big influences on Stoicism. Incidentally, you might also enjoy some ancient Eastern thought.
if you're looking for something like Meditations, start with the Dhammapada. You can read it online
Anything you like[spoilers]Anything[/spoilers][spoilers]You[/spoilers][spoilers]Like[/spoilers]
Thanks alot, will check them outgood job.
Epictetus, golden sayings and discourses.
he didn't start with the GreeksYou should know what to do
The Greeks are great and I'm sure you'd enjoy them; their not all related to stoicism however but they do complement each other.
Damn why do the english publishers always pick so beautiful covers.Wish the publishers in my country would pay more attention to the covers.

I want to completely understand Western Civilization/Culture/History.I'm currently a NEET. It's hard for me to explain but all my life I've been very confused, just wandering around without much purpose and I needed to completely understand something before proceeding in many aspects of my life otherwise I would wander around on square one. I think my purposelessness is tied to not understanding the history/direction of the greats before me so I think understanding the main contributor to the modern world would be a good start Eastern Civilization is next after thisBasically looking for books that cover the intro of this articlehttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_cultureWhere should I begin? Good textbooks? Or dive straight in?
Kennth Clarke I guess.
Kenneth Clark I mean.
Get a jobReading is your biggest enabler atm
Are there any good books about what it was actually like during the medieval times? Bored of the Game of Thrones hyperbole.
completelyare you memeing or what?
medieval period is very broad, you think you can narrow down to a specific time or region, and also state what type of history you're intersted in by the got comment you may like political history, but social history is more relevant understanding everyday life
I think it's a bit broad to ask for books on "Western civilisation" however, I can however recommended books on early civilisations that impacted the West.John Romer's "A History of Ancient Egypt: From the First Farmers to the Great Pyramid"Michael Roaf's "The Cultural Atlas of Mesopotamia and the Ancient Near East"Eric Cline's "1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed"Tom Holland's "Persian Fire: The First World Empire, Battle for the West"Also, anything on Alexander the Great is a must.Personally if I were you, I'd start with textbooks."Millennium: The End of the World and the Forging of Christendom" by Tom Holland is god-tier.
It's a bit of a Reddit book but http://www.amazon.co.uk/History-World-Bite-Sized-Chunks/dp/1843178869/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1433088638&sr=1-1&keywords=history+of+the+world+in+bite+sized+chunks is GOAT for understanding a brief overview of early history.
I guess the High Middle Ages period, that was it's "peak" right? Social history would be preferred.Thank you.
not well read in that period, but try:Keen, M. H. England in the Later Middle Ages: A Political History. London and New York: Routledge, 1990.A narrative history of the later Middle Ages, particularly the impact of politics and war on society. The 14th century is examined at length, but the 15th century also merits treatment, with the more effective control over nobility and gentry exerted by Edward IV, contrasted with the case of France.Hicks, Michael. Bastard Feudalism. London: Longman, 1995.A comprehensive synthesis of the theories and history regarding bastard feudalism, or the parallel system alongside tenurial feudalism of nonlanded aristocratic administration, private armies, and local affinities that governed England from the Middle Ages through 1650. Hicks argues for the persistence and legitimate functions of such a system of reciprocal contacts, of clientage and patronage, particularly in the later Middle Ages.Reilly, Bernard F. The Medieval Spains. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1993.The author emphasizes the diversity of peninsular history and its regional variations, but coverage is somewhat patchy, given the volume’s brevity, and most attention goes to Christian kingdoms. In English, this is suited to general readers.Jackson, Gabriel. The Making of Medieval Spain. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1972.The author concentrates mainly on Christian Spain, and on social, economic, and cultural history. Although now somewhat dated, this brief survey is noteworthy for its many pictures.Bisson, Thomas N. The Medieval Crown of Aragón: A Short History. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986.Bisson traces the history of Aragón and Catalonia before their union, through the creation of the “Crown of Aragón,” and into the 16th century. Covering mainly political history, this short volume is one of the few English surveys of the region.Ullmann, Walter. A Short History of the Papacy in the Middle Ages. London: Methuen, 1972.Still perhaps the best single-volume history, this book reflects the vast learning and pointed interpretations of its famous author.Schimmelpfennig, Bernhard. The Papacy. Translated by James Sievert. New York: Columbia University Press, 1992.Covering the entire medieval period and running down to 1534, this volume is clear and readable, but sometimes slightly idiosyncratic in coverage and interpretation.

I reccomend A History of the Ancient Greeks by Pomeroy and others. Clearly goes ovet Greek history and there culture, politics, and society. You can also 'Start with the Greeks' with this book as well. There's a brief history version aswell; it still is great quality however. Plus it's a fun read

+1 fortextbooksI'm in a similar boat, OP. I've asked similar questions as yours how do I into Western civ? on /lit/ and reddit, and people usually tell me that it's impossible without reading a lot of books. Most people will say that reading single-text histories of the West is a waste of time. I'm not sure.In any case, I decided to take /lit/'s advice and start with the memes; right now I'm reading Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History. May or may not read another textbook on the same subject; then I'll finish Edith Hamilton's "Mythology," possibly reread Homer, read Thucydides, and then attempt to do the standard tour of greek literature and philosophy, maybe using one of /lit/'s charts. I'm a slow reader, and so for me to read about all of history might be a lifetime endeavor; I'm not sure. I'm burning to learn more about the modern world, but I feel like I need a strong base of historical knowledge to do so meaningfully.
Just got into literature. I wanna read some classics. Should I go for the cheap Wordsworth edition or penguin?
I can't fucking stand Wordsworth covers.
Go to a library
interact with peopleno thanks.
Doesn't actually matter much, just depends on what kind of binding and shit you prefer. Generally they have the same text in them. I personally try to avoid both because Wordsworth has joke covers and Penguin seems like a bit of a monopoly to me. You can go with either as long as those things don't bother you.
Wordsworth is seriously bad, though.
Oxford is the way to go.
Wordsworth is fine so long as you avoid their translations.
Just avoid Wordsworth's translations and some of the more ridiculous covers. The books themselves are actually better put together than Vintage Classics, for example.
Collin's Classics for best value.Never buy a Penguin translation.
his library doesn't have self-check outsorry man
Oxford is Goat
Never buy a Penguin translation.Don't listen to this moron. The best translations are pretty evenly distributed between Penguin, Oxford, Vintage and miscellaneous others.
Penguin isn't the best, but it isn't the worst either. At the very least, it has nice colors.
Penguin isn't the best, but it isn't the worst either.It depends on the specific book. In many cases, Penguin is the best. I'd say that Oxford is most frequently the best, though.
